          "authors": "Daniel Skorich",
          "abstract": "Self-Categorization Theory (Turner et al., 1987; 1994) has proven itself to be one of the most influential and robust explanatory theories in social cognition. Its two foundational texts have been cited almost 25,000 times and it has spurred theoretical, empirical, and applied research across a wide array of topics. Despite its successes, I will argue in this talk that its theoretical commitment to a “Roschian” prototype view of categorization holds it back. In particular, I will argue that its reliance on the “principle of meta-contrast” for category discrimination (1) renders it computationally intractable; and (2) saddles it with a model of semantic content that does not meet the criterion of naturalness. I will propose instead that Fodor’s (1995; Fodor &amp; Pylyshyn, 2015) “conceptual atomism” should be adopted. I will outline Fodor’s critiques of what he refers to as the “inferential role semantics” of prototype models and discuss their relevance to self-categorization. I will then explore the implications for Self-Categorization Theory of adopting a conceptual atomism approach, with a particular emphasis on issues of context dependence, prototypicality, and perceiver readiness.",

          "abstract": "Self-Categorization Theory (Turner et al., 1987; 1994) has proven itself to be one of the most influential and robust explanatory theories in social psychology. Its two foundational texts have been cited almost 25,000 times and it has spurred theoretical, empirical, and applied research across a wide array of topics. Despite its successes, I will argue in this talk that a number of its theoretical and meta-theoretical commitments and the underdetermination of some of its core tenets hold it back. Specifically, I will outline 5 related issues in current statements, understandings, and/or operationalizations of the theory: (1) an overemphasis on (and sometimes conflation of) groups as categories; (2) a general ambiguity with regard to the nature of the stimuli being categorized; (3) an underappreciation of the distinction between categories and entities; (4) a relative absence of recursive embedding in conceptions of the self and of the relations between self and other; and (5) the implausibility (and perhaps the computational intractability) of meta-contrast as a basis for category differentiation. I will conclude the talk with a discussion of ways in which these challenges can be addressed, with the goal of strengthening Self-Categorization Theory and extending its scope into the future.",

          "abstract": "We present a framework for developing “virtual patients” to augment training for Mental Health Professionals (MHPs) with a process that is more scalable and systematic than current practice which relies on human role-play for the training and evaluation of patient interaction. We show how to combine large language models, retrieval-augmented personification (a novel variant of retrieval-augmented generation), and custom code-based logic to create a psychology engine that simulates realistic patient responses by emulating several key psychological mechanisms: short- and long-term memory, varying levels of conscious awareness about topics (as well as modulation of such awareness), and dynamic mood states where attitudes toward topics of conversation evolve over the course of the dialogue. We also describe algorithms for creating realistic patients with coherent symptom profiles and backstories. Taken together, these tools produce a realistic training partner for an MHP, enabling both training-at-scale as well as automated evaluation of specific skill sets. We discuss how our psychology engine framework makes training qualified MHPs more efficient and scalable, facilitates the continuing education needed as potential new treatments such as psychedelics emerge from clinical trials.",

Using simulations, we found that model comparison methods like leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO), coupled with Bayesian hierarchical modeling, can correctly identify the underlying model. Additionally, using the correct model reduces the risk of missing true effects or detecting spurious findings. Therefore, we recommend researchers implement and compare both models for Go/No-Go studies to reduce misleading results. Lastly, we implemented these models to investigate race effects in the decision to shoot during police training. We found that the accumulated evidence needed to reach the Shoot decision is lower for Black suspects, which explains the heightened error rates for shooting unarmed Black suspects in data.",

          "abstract": "Collective action is a powerful force driving social change but often sparks contention about what actions are acceptable means to effect social change. We investigated double standards in judging collective action—that is, whether observers judge the same protest actions to be more acceptable depending on who the protesters are and what they are protesting. In two studies, we used item response theory to develop an instrument of 25 controversial protest actions to measure where people draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable forms of collective action. In three preregistered experiments (N = 2776), we found no consistent evidence for ingroup bias in terms of social class when judging protests for workers’ rights (Experiment 1), in terms of race when judging protests for and against defunding the police (Experiment 2), and in terms of gender when judging protests for and against restricting abortion (Experiment 3). Instead, we found that progressive participants (Experiments 1–3) who rejected system-justifying beliefs (Experiments 1–2) considered the same protest actions more acceptable when a cause aligned with their ideological orientation (for workers’ rights, for defunding the police, against restricting abortion) than when it did not (against defunding the police, for restricting abortion). Conservative participants considered the same actions somewhat more acceptable when protesters supported, rather than opposed, restricting abortion (Experiment 3) but considered all protest actions, for and against defunding the police, equally unacceptable (Experiment 2). Our findings have theoretical and practical implications for understanding the often-divided response to social movements.",

          "abstract": "Adults aged 65 and older are the fastest growing population demographic. Standard, stationary eye tracking has been used to test for age differences in attention and cognition toward understanding decline trajectories and identifying ways to enhance functioning into late life. More recently, advanced methods of at-home eye tracking, mobile eye tracking, and simultaneous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and eye tracking have suggested promise for insight into more dynamic and naturalistic processes of visual attentional and cognitive processing as well as their brain correlates in aging. Here, we outline challenges, best practices, and novel frontiers in the use of eye-tracking methodology among older adults. We cover considerations pertaining to optimized age-tailored study designs and procedures, eye-tracker setup as well as data quality and analysis. Throughout, we reflect on our experiences conducting novel experiments via at-home and mobile eye tracking as well as simultaneous MRI-eye tracking in aging populations. We also present empirical data comparing the quality of eye tracking in the behavioral lab vs. the MRI environment among both young and older adults, in support of simultaneous MRI-eye tracking informing brain-behavior links in aging, while acknowledging trade-offs in data quality of this combined methodology. We propose for future research to leverage these novel, advanced eye-tracking applications for a more comprehensive and real-life capture of attentional and cognitive changes with age.",

          "abstract": "Valuing the welfare of others is a fundamental aspect of empathy and prosocial behavior. How do people develop this valuation? Theories of associative learning suggest people can associate social cues, such as smiles, with personal reward, thus feeling good when others thrive. Yet, people often display generalized concern for others’ welfare, regardless of the specific cues present. We propose that Pavlovian conditioning allows people to associate reward directly with others’ abstract mental states, learning that another's happiness predicts their own reward.  In four online experiments with U.S. adults (N = 1500), participants’ monetary outcomes were congruently or incongruently predicted by a target’s mental states. Participants who experienced congruent learning reported more empathic feelings towards the target in novel situations.

          "authors": "Sebastian Nicolas Thomas Vogel; Justine Stang-Rabrig; Philipp Jugert; Birgit Leyendecker; Nele McElvany",
          "abstract": "A steady rise in global migration has led to a growing share of immigrant-origin children in schools, who face manifold challenges. Primary schools are a key environment for these children’s development and adaptation. The normative developmental, psychological adjustment, and acculturative tasks shaping their adaptation are reflected in different measures of school success. Additionally, students’ families can support their development, but the specific mechanisms may vary between first-generation, second-generation, and non-immigrant students. As few studies differentiate between students from different immigrant generations, there is a need to investigate adaptation process of first-generation and second-generation immigrant students separately, and in comparison to their non-immigrant peers. For a comprehensive view, we investigated several central measures of school success (reading competence, grade point average, academic track recommendation, life satisfaction), as well as the role of the family microsystem, including family structure variables (majority language use, socio-economic status), educational believes (educational aspirations), and family process variables (parent-child reading). Collecting data from N = 271 German fourth-graders (M(age) = 10.47 years, SD = 0.55; 54.2% female, 44.6% male, 0.4% non-binary; n = 102 first-generation, n = 68 second-generation, n = 101 non-immigrants) and controlling for age differences, we found disadvantages regarding first-generation students’ reading competence, grades, and likelihood of receiving a high track recommendation compared to second-generation and/or non-immigrant students. However, no significant differences emerged between second-generation and non-immigrant students. Multigroup analyses revealed that, among family variables, high educational aspirations were positively associated with grades and parent-child reading positively related to higher life satisfaction independent of immigrant status. Furthermore, life satisfaction was additionally positively predicted by educational aspirations in first-generation immigrant students only, and by socioeconomic status among second-generation immigrant students. The results highlight families as a source of valuable resources to protect students against educational disadvantages, but specific mechanisms may differ depending on students’ immigrant status. This is especially important for first-generation immigrant students, for whom we found significant educational discrepancies compared to second-generation and non-immigrant students.",

Findings\nsuggest that loneliness among gamers might be related to higher levels of internet addiction,\nsocial anxiety, and the video game genre they predominantly engage with (MMORPGs vs.\nFPS). Also, the perception of loneliness tended to be lower among older players and those who\ncommunicated with friends (vs strangers) via voice chat during gameplay. More importantly,\nour analyses demonstrated that a significant portion of the effect of social anxiety on loneliness\nwas mediated by internet addiction, while the effect of internet addiction on loneliness was\nnegatively moderated by greater weekly gaming time.

          "authors": "Noel Lam; Marianna E. Hayiou-Thomas; Matthew HC Mak; Lisa Henderson",
          "abstract": "Theories of memory consolidation claim that new word learning is bolstered by existing semantic knowledge. However, when semantic knowledge exerts its effects (i.e., at encoding and/or consolidation) and whether semantic benefits change across development remains unclear. Sixty-one children (Experiment 1) and 63 adults (Experiment 2) learned novel word forms paired with pictures of (i) real but rare animals akin to existing animals (Highly Linkable to existing knowledge), (ii) fictitious animals that were less clearly associated with familiar animals (Less Linkable), and (iii) “name tags” written with unfamiliar symbols (Unlinkable). Word form and meaning recall were tested immediately, 1 day and 1 week after learning. Children showed greater improvements across tests than adults despite comparable performance immediately after learning. Regardless of test sessions, semantic knowledge benefited adults’ recall of word form and meaning, with additional benefit from highly versus less linkable knowledge. Children only showed semantic benefits in meaning (and not word form) recall, with additional benefits from highly linkable knowledge. Instead, children’s word form recall was more globally associated with receptive vocabulary and nonword repetition. These results suggest that when present, the benefits of semantic information permeate across the timecourse of word learning; they also point to developmental differences in word learning mechanisms. Adults made clear use of associated semantic knowledge, whereas children showed more general associations between word learning and language abilities and greater benefit from offline consolidation. These results highlight the need for models of word learning and consolidation to incorporate developmental and individual differences.",

          "authors": "Ludovic Rey; Amélie J. A. A. Guyon; Horst Hildebrandt; Angelika Güsewell; Antje Horsch; Urs Nater; Jeremy Jamieson; Patrick Gomez",
          "abstract": "Musicians’ performance experiences range widely, from elation to severe anxiety. In this study, we examined musicians’ performance experiences through the lens of the biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat. According to this model, a challenge state arises when perceived resources meet or exceed perceived demands, while a threat state occurs when demands outweigh resources. These states can be quantified using the Demand Resource Evaluation Score (DRES), calculated as the difference between resource and demand evaluations, with higher values indicating a greater challenge-type response. Although post-event processing is a key factor in maintaining social anxiety, research on factors influencing musicians’ post-performance thoughts remains limited. Additionally, the link between DRES and post-performance thoughts is unknown. This study aimed to determine 1) how DRES is influenced by the general music performance anxiety (MPA) level, audience presence, and time (pre-performance vs. during-performance); 2) how negative and positive post-performance thoughts are influenced by general MPA level and audience presence; and 3) whether DRES predicts post-performance thoughts. Classical music students (N = 121) with varying levels of MPA performed solo in a private and a public session. We assessed pre-performance and during-performance DRES, and negative and positive post-performance thoughts. DRES decreased with increasing general MPA level, was lower in public than private sessions, and declined from pre-performance to during-performance. These effects were qualified by a three-way interaction: the effect of general MPA level was strongest before performing publicly, the audience effect was most pronounced at higher general MPA levels before performing, and the time effect was greatest at lower general MPA levels during public sessions. General MPA level was associated with more negative thoughts and fewer positive thoughts. Audience presence increased only negative thoughts. Higher during-performance DRES predicted fewer negative and more positive thoughts both intraindividually and interindividually, with pre-performance DRES showing similar interindividual effects. These findings demonstrate the complex interplay of personal and situational factors in shaping musicians’ challenge and threat experiences. Moreover, high general MPA levels are associated with a general tendency toward more negative and fewer positive post-performance thoughts. Interventions fostering challenge-oriented appraisals may enhance musicians’ post-performance processing, potentially mitigating performance anxiety.",

          "abstract": "Repeatedly seen or heard statements are typically judged to be more likely true than statements not encountered before, a phenomenon referred to as truth effect. Similarly, statements judged to be old typically receive higher truth judgments than statements judged to be new. However, it is unclear whether and how this recognition-based truth effect depends on the latent memory states underlying observed recognition judgments. In order to investigate this question, we used a model-based approach to compare truth judgments as a function of recognition judgments ('old' versus 'new') and their underlying memory states (state of memory certainty vs. state of uncertainty). In three experiments, we observed a recognition-based truth effect and found this effect to be larger in the state of memory certainty than in the state of uncertainty. This result also replicated for subjective instead of modeled memory states. Moreover, we found effects of recognition judgments on judged truth to be stronger than effects of factual repetition in all three experiments. Taken together, our research highlights the role of episodic memory processes in the truth effect and provides a methodological tool that takes underlying memory states into account.",

The model was designed to examine the potential role of toxic behaviour in social media interactions based on Spiral of Silence Theory predictions and incorporates sanctions and expected sanctions against opposition views, in the form of toxic behaviour. Toxic behaviour can cause agents’ views to be silenced as they attempt to avoid toxic interactions with opposing agents, which may allow agents to be persuaded to change their mind.",

          "abstract": "This study examined whether pupil size changes as a function of the memorability of natural scene images. In Experiment 1, the participants memorized, recognized, and passively viewed high- and low-memorability images adopted from an existing dataset. Baseline-corrected pupil sizes were larger for high-memorability images only in old trials during the recognition phase. However, after stricter control of image luminance and arousal, pupil dilation for high-memorability images was observed in all memorization, recognition, and passive view phases (Experiments 2 and 3). This effect of image memorability was further validated through item-based analyses. The pupil old/new effect and the subsequent memory effect on the pupil were replicated. The results of this research suggest that pupils are sensitive to image memorability, independent of the behavioral task required.",

          "authors": "Brandon McMurtrie; Matt N Williams; Ross Tane Hebden; Anja Roemer; Michael Philipp",
          "abstract": "Affective polarization—antipathy towards members of one’s political outgroup—may pose challenges to social cohesion and personal well-being. Prior studies have suggested that one’s affective polarization may cause intrapersonal harm as well as interpersonal harm. It has been associated with reduced social support, increased stress, and worse physical health. This pre-registered study investigated the intrapersonal harm of affective polarization using a six-wave longitudinal survey (N = 470). Affective polarization, social support, perceived stress, and self-rated health were measured fortnightly for three months preceding the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models were employed to investigate the within-person effects of affective polarization on these indictors of wellbeing. Contrary to hypotheses, none of the hypothesised cross-lagged effects were significant, suggesting that changes in affective polarization did not predict changes in social support, stress, or health. However, cross-sectional analyses did reflect past findings, showing that higher levels of affective polarization were associated with lower social support, greater stress, and worse health. We additionally found evidence for perceived stress causing moderate increases in affective polarization. Stable differences by political orientation were also observed in our sample, with liberals reporting higher affective polarization and stress, lower social support, and worse health. Despite the lack of significant effects, potentially due to limitations such as sample size and measurement constraints, our findings underscore the importance of further investigations with appropriate robust designs to clarify the relationship between affective polarization and well-being. These results challenge the assumption that affective polarization directly drives declines in well-being.",

Additionally, the study examined the role that resilience variables–mindfulness and emotion regulation–play in the association between victimization timing and PTSS severity.\nMethod: Participants were 247 cisgender community women aged 21-30 recruited for a larger study on high-risk drinking and sexual behaviors. Victimization history was assessed using the Computer Assisted Maltreatment Inventory and Sexual Experiences Survey-Revised. PTSS severity was measured with the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5. Emotion regulation and mindfulness were evaluated using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale-36 and Southampton Mindfulness Questionnaire, respectively. Negative binomial regression models tested the hypotheses.\nResults: Analyses revealed significant differences in PTSS severity by victimization timing: CSA + ASA was associated with the greatest PTSS severity, followed by ASA-only, and CSA-only reporting the lowest severity. Mindfulness and emotion regulation were directly associated with reduced PTSS severity across all victimization profiles. \nConclusions: Revictimization was linked to the most severe PTSS, underscoring the need for targeted interventions. Mindfulness and emotion regulation were associated with reduced PTSS severity, regardless of victimization timing. Future interventions could prioritize enhancing psychological skills, like mindfulness and emotion regulation, to reduce distress for victim-survivors of sexual victimization.",

          "abstract": "This paper connects deception research, specifically truth-default theory (TDT), to\nmisinformation research. Through TDT’s propositions and supporting empirics, we demonstrate\nhow the central questions in misinformation research can benefit from deeper engagement with\ndeception scholarship and in particular TDT. Findings in the misinformation literature that have\nbeen surprising or unexpected (e.g., relatively few people are exposed to and share\nmisinformation online) are predicted and explained by TDT. Robust conclusions from TDT\nabout deception in human communication (e.g., people are truth-biased) are challenged by\nfindings from misinformation research, prompting deeper investigation. Deception detection\nresearch paradigms have important lessons for misinformation research about the design of\nmisinformation-detection tasks that should be considered when interpreting results (e.g.,\ntrue-false base rates, prompted vs. unprompted veracity judgments). Analytic approaches from\nTDT (e.g., analyzing accuracy for truthful and deceptive messages independently) provide a\nframework for misinformation research to better understand the detection of misinformation and\nmore holistically evaluate the outcomes of misinformation interventions, and TDT’s lessons on\nhow to improve deception detection accuracy also suggest strategies for interventions which\nimprove the detection of misinformation without undermining trust in credible news and\ninformation.",

          "abstract": "Information search biases contribute to the formation and exacerbation of polarization and\nextremism across many types of beliefs. These biases can be induced by different goals,\nmanifesting even in rational decision strategies that maximize choice efficiency. In this paper,\nwe explore how information sampling can be biased toward or away from extreme and\npolarized information, focusing on the case where people consider qualitative multi-criteria\ninformation about their options. Specifically, we examine how the incentives of a choice task\ncan lead to biased information search, while comparison or rating tasks can promote deeper\ninformation search and ameliorate or even reverse these biases. Across three studies, we (1)\ncreate ecologically valid information environments by having participants generate qualitative\ninformation they might consider when making a judgment or decision, (2) quantify the strength\nand extremeness of participant-generated pieces of information (attributes), and (3) track how\nparticipants sample this information in different goal conditions. We show that comparison and\nrating goals – where people rate the relative goodness of each option or rate them separately –\ncan reduce the extremeness of participants’ beliefs and degree of polarization relative to choice\ngoals where they simply decide between the options. This benefit occurs even when participants\nsample from the same pool of information (i.e., have the same information environment) across\ndifferent tasks. Put together, our results suggest that comparison and rating goals can serve as\nbias-reducing interventions that promote more balanced information sampling across domains\neven for qualitative and multi-criteria information.",

In all conditions, participants were asked to estimate their risk for the disease (i.e., subjective likelihood) and to decide whether they would get vaccinated. In two conditional-wording conditions (one of which involved a delayed decision), participants were asked about their risk if they did not get vaccinated. For an unconditional/benchmark condition, this conditional was not explicitly stated but was still formally applicable because participants had not yet been informed that a vaccine was even available for this disease. \n\nResults: When people gave risk estimates to a conditionally-worded risk question after making a decision, the observed relationship between perceived risk and prevention decisions was inflated (relative to in the unconditional/benchmark condition). \n\nConclusions: The use of conditionals in risk questions can lead to overestimates of the impact of perceived risk on prevention decisions, but not necessarily to a degree that should call for their omission.",

          "authors": "Aja Louise Murray; Xuefei Li; Tom Booth",
          "abstract": "Ageism can be defined as stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination based on a person’s age and has been shown in past research to be both common and harmful. In 2016 WHO received a mandate from its Member States to lead a major global campaign to address ageism against all ages. Evidence synthesised as part of the campaign brought into focus the need for new measures of ageism experiences that can capture its multidimensional nature, and that can be used to measure the experiences of  individuals of a wide range of ages and living in diverse country settings. Previous research has documented the development and validation of a 15-item version of the newly developed 15-item scale; however, as space in large-scale surveys is at a premium, there is a strong need for even briefer versions. The current article proposes and evaluates a 5-item brief WHO ageism experiences scale that measures self-directed, interpersonal, and institutional ageism and covers stereotypes, prejudices, and discrimination. Psychometric properties, including test-retest reliability and concurrent validity in a UK mixed-age adult sample (N= 402) were tested. Findings supported the convergent and divergent validity of the scale, and its test-retest reliability. It also showed patterns of associations with health and age that would be expected based on previous research.  These results provide preliminary for support the use of the brief scale in contexts where survey space is highly constrained. It lays the foundation for future work to extend the testing of the 5-item scale in other languages, populations, and settings and to a wider range of relevant psychometric properties.",

          "authors": "Giacomo Spinelli; Simone Sulpizio",
          "abstract": "Theories of adaptive (and cognitive) control assume that selecting target information in the context of highly salient distractors depends on limited-capacity resources. Building on this assumption, theories of language-control associations propose that the opportunities afforded by bilingualism to engage such effortful selection, such as when speaking in a nondominant language, might improve domain-general adaptive control. The assumption that domain-general or language-specific selection is resource-demanding, however, has surprisingly little empirical support. Here, we tested that assumption by having unbalanced Italian-English bilinguals perform both an L1 Stroop task and an L2 picture-naming task simultaneously with an n-back task. Both tasks showed costs due to the load produced by the n-back task and distractor interference, with slower responses to incongruent (the word GREEN in the color red) and congruent stimuli (RED in red) than neutral ones (XXX in red) in the L1 Stroop task and to noncognate than cognate pictures (pictures with different/similar L1 and L2 names) in the L2 picture-naming task. However, neither task showed larger distractor interference with greater load, with Bayesian analyses favoring the absence of such interactions. These results suggest that domain-general and language-specific selection may occur reactively, i.e., only when the need arises, with no strong reliance on limited-capacity resources. Further, they invite a rethinking of both adaptive-control theories assuming resource-demanding selection and theories of language-control associations assuming that regularly engaging such selection would be conducive to domain-general benefits.",

In Experiment 2, we replicated this pattern using a more implicit manipulation of perceived performance, a surreptitious delay in the onset of response targets. Participants were more likely to report MW after delay than control trials. In both experiments, confidence in on-task reports was lower when the corresponding indicator (falsely) implied poor performance.

          "abstract": "The 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar has been criticised for numerous social, political, and environmental issues. While an important call to boycott the tournament spread worldwide, research has yet to document the motives underlying a boycott of such a mega sporting event. We investigated fans’ intentions to boycott the 2022 FIFA World Cup in four countries of the Francophonie engaged in the World Cup (N = 1,635). We found that being highly identified with the team and enjoying football for aesthetic pleasures predicted rejection of the boycott, while the most robust predictor of boycott intentions was a concern for environmental issues. When assessing actual boycott behaviours among fans after the World Cup (N = 286), we found a significant decrease compared to boycott intentions. Importantly, this intention–behaviour gap was even more pronounced among politicised fans with high awareness of social and environmental issues who had initially planned to boycott the tournament. We discuss the paradox of calls to boycott mega sporting events: Unlike other consumer products, these events often have no alternatives, yet they are central to the social identity of sports fans. As a consequence, such a boycott may be better explained by a low level of fandom rather than solely by strong political values, with remaining boycotters likely being those who had little interest in the event from the outset.",

However, many studies use translation pairs with high phonological overlap (e.g., the English-GERMAN: 'milk'-'MILCH') making it difficult to discern the origin of the co-activation. This study examined language co-activation in Catalan-Spanish bilingual toddlers using words with minimal phonological overlap across translations. Three-year-olds participated in a visual word paradigm, searching for an absent target (e.g., 'apple' in Catalan: 'poma', Spanish: 'MANZANA') among images with labels that shared the initial phoneme across languages or were unrelated. The design included three types of images: (a) Catalan-to-Spanish phonologically related images (e.g., Spanish 'PATO' for 'duck'), (b) Spanish-to-Catalan phonologically related (e.g., Catalan 'mitjó' for 'sock'), and (c) unrelated items (e.g., 'brush', 'sandwich'). If bilingual toddlers co-activate languages, they should look more at related than unrelated images due to shared phonological onsets. The results supported the hypotheses and provided solid evidence that young bilinguals co-activate phonologically related words in their familiar languages.",

          "abstract": "Sequence learning in the serial response time task (SRTT) is one of the few learning phenomena that are widely agreed to be implicit in nature (i.e., that learning may proceed in the absence of awareness), while it is also possible to explicitly learn a sequence of events. In the past few decades, research into sequence learning largely focused on the type of representation that may underlie implicit sequence learning, and whether or not two independent learning systems are necessary to explain qualitative differences between implicit and explicit learning. Using the drift-diffusion model, here we take a cognitive-processes perspective on sequence learning and investigate the cognitive operations that benefit from implicit and explicit sequence learning (e.g., stimulus detection or encoding, response selection, or response facilitation). To separate the processes involved in expressing implicit versus explicit knowledge, we manipulated explicit sequence knowledge independently of the opportunity to express such knowledge, and analyzed the resulting performance data with a dynamic drift-diffusion model to disentangle the contributions of the aforementioned processes on. Results revealed that implicit sequence learning does not affect stimulus processing, but benefits response selection. Moreover, beyond response selection, response execution was affected. Explicit sequence knowledge did not change this pattern if participants worked on probabilistic materials, where it is difficult to anticipate the next response. However, if materials were deterministic, explicit knowledge enabled participants to switch from stimulus-based to plan-based action control, which was reflected in ample changes in the cognitive processes involved in performing the task.\n  First implications for theories of sequence learning, and how the diffusion model may be helpful in future research into implicit and explicit sequence learning,\n  are dicussed.",

          "abstract": "Accumulating evidence shows that the phonological production of words does not follow a single pathway, as was assumed in the past. Rather, some words are produced via dedicated production pathways. Previous studies showed such pathway separation for words from different categories (e.g., number versus non-number words) or with different meanings (number words with numerical versus non-numerical meaning, e.g., ‘Nine West’). Here, we show that the separation of phonological production pathways is even greater than that: even the same word with the same meaning can follow different phonological production pathways, depending on the context in which the word is produced. We report HLI, a woman with aphasia. She erred in 5 number-production tasks, all with phonological output but with different input modalities: digits, written number words, dice patterns, encyclopedic questions, and approximate quantities. We conclude she had impaired phonological production of number words. Critically, she performed relatively well in 3 other phonological number production tasks: oral calculation, counting, and repetition. This dissociation indicates multiple phonological production pathways for verbal numbers. We propose that HLI has a deficit in a default phonological production pathway, which serves most number-production tasks. At the same time, other, dedicated pathways of phonological number production, which are recruited uniquely by the calculation, counting, and repetition tasks, are spared. Finally, we propose a concrete model that explains when and how the dedicated, task-specific phonological-access pathways are created, and we show that HLI’s performance satisfies a central prediction of this model.",

Consistently, participants rated deliberative reasoning as superior to intuition, regardless of accuracy. Deliberative thinkers were seen as smarter and more trustworthy—a preference that held even under time pressure and cognitive load, suggesting it arises intuitively. Studies with LLMs (ChatGPT 3.5 and 4) replicated the human preference pattern, indicating that AI language models capture human folk beliefs about reasoning. These findings suggest a strong intuitive link between deliberation and reliability, with critical implications for public trust in human and AI recommendations.",

          "abstract": "High-quality listening is a multifaceted social behaviour, and theories and research concerning it are mixed in terms of listening definitions and recommendations. The current study canvassed lay practitioners’ understanding of optimal listening qualities and training, drawing on a wide range of listening training materials (N = 207) sourced from the World-Wide-Web. Thematic analysis results were critically examined to systematically position praxis against our current understanding of listening theories. Findings are presented as a “dialectical listening theory” which posits that at its core, listeners’ behaviours often exist in direct tension with their mindset or intuition. Furthermore, we posit that this tension is amplified when individuals are faced with conversations that conflict with their perspectives or values. Finally, we argue that listeners may need to oscillate between dual-process states of unconscious (intuitive) and conscious (intentional) listening. We conclude that high-quality listening involves direct recognition and strategic management of tensions throughout the listening process.  \nKeywords: Listening, Listening Training, Thematic Analysis, Dual-processing",

          "abstract": "Narrative comprehension, a cognitive skill essential for social participation, relies on a range of abilities, including memory and inference-making. While aging-related cognitive changes are well-documented, research on narrative comprehension in aging populations yields mixed findings, underscoring the importance of this study. This preregistered study examines how age, education, and presentation format (i.e., the narrative’s codality: pictorial vs. textual) influence inference generation in older adults (N = 143, aged 62–86 years). Participants were presented with pictorial and textual stories consisting of three panels, with the second panel replaced with a blank panel. Their task was to comprehend the stories and determine whether the inferences provided for the missing event were correct or incorrect. Results reveal that pictorial narratives were better comprehended than textual ones; however, this advantage attenuates with increasing age. Contrary to expectations, narrative comprehension was largely resilient to age-related declines, as neither age nor education significantly impaired performance. Exploratory analyses tested the influence of protective (e.g., physical and mental activity, companionship) and risk factors (e.g., depression, anxiety, chronic pain, stress, and poor sleep) but found no significant impact on comprehension. Notably, narrative comprehension correlated with memory performance but not with other cognitive abilities, underscoring its specificity within the broader cognitive domain. These findings highlight the stability of narrative comprehension across media and aging, while also suggesting a narrowing pictorial advantage with age. Implications for existing cognitive theories and future research directions are discussed.",

          "abstract": "According to the dual-hormone hypothesis, the influence of testosterone on status-relevant behaviors is larger when cortisol levels are low. Empirical evidence for this theory is mixed, and studies in clinical populations are virtually non-existent. One group of interest are adolescents with ADHD, as these adolescents engage more often in status-relevant behaviors like risk taking, aggression and sensation seeking. In the current investigation, we therefore tested if testosterone and cortisol, and their interaction, mediate the association between ADHD and risk taking, aggression, and sensation seeking. Adolescents with (N=80) and without (N=100) ADHD (Mage=15.1 years) performed an experimental risk-taking task and completed self-report measures of aggression and sensation seeking. The results showed that (1) the groups did not differ on testosterone or cortisol, whereas evidence for a group difference in testosterone × cortisol was limited to one of the mediation models; (2) the groups did not differ on measures of risk taking, aggression and sensation seeking; (3) cortisol and testosterone × cortisol did not predict any of the outcome measures, and testosterone was associated with sensation seeking. Accordingly, analyses found no evidence of endocrine mediation between ADHD status and status-relevant behaviors. The current study was the first to test the dual-hormone hypothesis in adolescents with ADHD. The findings suggest that in this group testosterone, cortisol, nor their interaction were related to the higher propensity towards status-relevant behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Which visual displays do we aesthetically appreciate, and why? Order and complexity have often been suggested as important factors related to appreciation, but the exact type and direction of their relation to appreciation is still under debate. To clarify the contributions of order and complexity to appreciation, it is important to manipulate order and complexity independently and in a parametrically controlled fashion, to study their relation to appreciation in combination rather than separately, and to acknowledge the multidimensional nature of order and complexity. In an online study, we investigated individuals’ aesthetic preferences (N = 367) for three different types of complexity (i.e., the number of colors, shapes, and sizes in the display) while also varying the order level of the display (i.e., the number of element position switches in the applied pattern). Firstly, results indicated that not all complexity types are appreciated similarly: Whereas color complexity was on average preferred, size and shape complexity influenced preferences negatively. Secondly, all three complexity types were more often preferred in highly ordered stimuli than in stimuli with a lower order level, indicating a stimulating effect of order on preferences for complexity. Thirdly, we found both individual and contextual variation in preferences for complexity: Especially the extent to which color complexity is preferred varied across individuals and the specific set of colors used in the display.",

          "authors": "Stefan Wöhner; Friederike Derichsweiler; Jana Luckow; Jörg D. Jescheniak",
          "abstract": "Semantic context effects in picture naming and categorization are central to word production theories. However, unlike naming studies, categorization studies have shown inconsistent results. Recently, Wöhner, Luckow et al. (2024) replicated the inconsistent pattern in blocked categorization in a within-participant and within-item design. Pictures were presented in a semantically homogeneous or heterogeneous context. In the homogeneous context, there was interference for naming, facilitation for naturalness categorization, but no context effect for size categorization. The authors concluded that the inconsistent categorization findings in their own and previous studies could be due either to the use of tasks based on different kinds of features (stored in semantic memory [natural vs. man-made] vs. ad hoc [smaller vs. larger than a standard]) or to a difference in the response mapping for the exemplars from the semantic categories creating the context (convergent vs. divergent). The present study again contrasted the Wöhner, Luckow et al. tasks, but used materials which resulted in convergent response mapping for both categorization tasks. There was semantic interference in naming and semantic facilitation in both naturalness and size categorization. This pattern suggests that convergent response mapping, not the use of a task based on a stored semantic feature, is critical for obtaining facilitation in blocked semantic categorization. Our result provides further support for the notion that semantic interference in blocked word production has its locus at the lexical level and its origin at the semantic level. This conclusion does not depend any longer on data from only a single categorization task.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: While research and public debate have increasingly focused on the effects of pornography\nconsumption, the experiences of those documented in pornography have been largely overlooked. This study aims to address this gap by examining the vulnerabilities and health risks faced by this population. Materials and methods: Individuals aged 18 and older documented in pornography in Sweden were recruited to participate in face-to-face interviews. A total of 120 participants completed study-specific questions and standardized questionnaires on their background, experiences in pornography, and health status. Descriptive statistics were reported, and regression analyses were performed to assess factors impacting PTSD symptom severity and dissociative symptoms.\nResults: Participants reported high levels of abuse both in childhood and during pornography\nproduction. Nearly all participants had experienced sexual abuse (88%), psychological abuse (90%), and physical abuse (79%) as children. In the context of pornography production, they were subjected to further abuse and exploitation, including verbal abuse (87%), rape (65%), physical assault (56%),\nthird-party control (56%), and online harassment (57%). The consequences of this continuous\npolyvictimization were significant: 84% exhibited clinically significant PTSD symptoms, 60% clinically\nsignificant dissociative symptoms, 69% had attempted suicide, and 80% had been diagnosed with at\nleast one mental health problem. Regression analyses revealed that childhood and online polyvictimization significantly predicted PTSD symptom severity, while polyvictimization within pornography production predicted dissociative symptoms. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the urgent need for comprehensive mental health interventions and legal reform to protect this vulnerable population and address the unique harms stemming from documentation in pornography.",

          "authors": "Taym Alsalti; Jamie Cummins; Ruben C. Arslan",
          "abstract": "Careless responding is defined as a pattern of responding to survey items that reflects a latent construct distinct from—and disruptive of—the measurement of the primary construct of interest. In the social science literature, these response patterns are sometimes labeled “insufficient effort,” “unserious,” or “bogus, among other terms.”The issue of such responses has been gaining in relevance as research data are increasingly collected through anonymous online surveys. Standard practice calls for identifying careless responders and excluding them from the data. The common reasoning behind this approach is that such responses can bias “descriptive” statistics (e.g., sample means) and effect size estimates / measures of associations (e.g., correlations and  standardised mean difference) as well as increase measurement error. When they confound our causal effect of interest, deleting or adjusting for careless responses is justified. However, using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), we show that different careless responding patterns can plausibly take on the role of a mediator, a collider, or both simultaneously, among others. Given this, we argue that, in contrast to previous calls, there cannot be a general rule about how to deal with careless responses and that greater attention to their data-generating mechanism from a causal perspective is necessary.",

          "abstract": "In conflict tasks, congruency effects are thought to reflect attentional control mechanisms needed to counteract response conflict elicited by incongruent stimuli. Although congruency effects are well-replicable experimentally, recent studies have evidenced low correlations between congruency effects measured across different paradigms, leading to a heated debate over whether these low correlations indicate a lack of construct validity or are rather attributable to high measurement error, as indicated by the poor reliability typically displayed by congruency effects. In the present study, we investigated whether the poor reliabilities of congruency effects are due to their poor theoretical specification. Specifically, we tested whether the psychometric properties of congruency effects can be improved by focusing exclusively on those trials in which response conflict is theoretically expected to be highest. We considered two factors modulating the degree of response conflict: previous trial congruency, with higher conflict following congruent trials, and the time elapsed since stimulus onset, with higher conflict in fast responses. Data from 195 participants completing a Simon and a spatial Stroop paradigm showed that generally poor split-half reliabilities for the full set of trials improved greatly when excluding post-incongruent and slow trials. Importantly, between-task correlations also increased substantially when controlling for these factors, suggesting that, with increased reliability, these tasks capture a common attentional control ability. Our results suggest that individual differences in conflict tasks can provide valid and reliable measures of attentional control when focusing on the trials with the theoretically highest response conflict.",

High variability phonetic training (HVPT) is one method that has proven highly effective at helping individuals develop robust L2 perceptual categories, and recent meta-analytic work suggests that multi-talker training conditions provide a small but statistically reliable benefit compared to single-talker training. However, no study has compared lower and higher variability multi-talker conditions to determine how the number of talkers affects training outcomes, even though such information can shed additional light on how talker variability affects phonetic training. In this study, we randomly assigned 458 L2 Spanish learners to a two-talker or six-talker HVPT group or to a control group that did not receive HVPT. Training focused on L2 Spanish stops. We tested performance on trained talkers and words as well as several forms of generalization. The experimental groups improved more and demonstrated greater generalization than the control group, but neither experimental group outpaced the other.

          "abstract": "Relational mobility, the degree of opportunity to form new relationships in a particular environment, explains cultural differences in interpersonal behavior. Theoretically, relational mobility is thought to be related to the contrasting tendencies in social networks: expansion of relationships (i.e., trust) and commitment to existing relationships (i.e., intimacy). This study reexamined whether perceived relational mobility is associated with the formation and maintenance of social networks. We conducted a cross-cultural survey and investigated the correlations between generalized trust, intimacy with friends, self-disclosure, and the number of social networks with the data of 297 American and 292 Japanese people. Consistent with previous studies, this study found that Americans are more likely than Japanese to trust strangers, feel intimate with and disclose themselves to their closest friends, and have more relationships. Relational mobility explained the cultural difference in generalized trust but not in intimacy with friends when controlling for individual characteristics, such as personality traits. Generalized trust was associated with a greater number of people to seek advice from, and a greater number of advice networks was correlated with higher levels of subjective well-being. The results suggest that relational mobility is associated with psychology related to expanding networks, rather than strengthening existing relationships.",

          "abstract": "To manage life’s stressors, we can self-regulate our emotions or seek social regulatory support. One commonly used strategy is reappraisal, where individuals reframe their own negative emotions (i.e. self-reappraisal) or help others reframe their negative emotions (i.e. social-reappraisal). Here, we compared the neural mechanisms underlying self- and social-reappraisal of negative autobiographical memories using standard univariate contrasts, Bayes factor and multivariate classifier approaches. Both self- and social-reappraisal recruited regions associated with control, such as dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Notably, multivariate patterns within control regions were indistinguishable, suggesting they play similar roles in self- and social-reappraisal. Second, social-reappraisal was both quantitatively and qualitatively different from self-reappraisal in its recruitment of control and mentalizing regions, such as the right lateral prefrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex and right temporal pole. Multivariate patterns within regions associated with mentalizing were distinguishable between self- and social-reappraisal, suggesting that they are specifically involved when reappraising for others. Finally, both self- and social-reappraisal modulated activity in regions associated with affective responding and the perceptual representation of remembered scenes, including the mid-orbital frontal cortex, left insula and parahippocampus. Taken together, these data reveal the processes supporting self and social emotion regulation with implications for both basic and clinical research.",

          "abstract": "The surge of online psychological assessments have brought the autism research community both opportunities and challenges: while they enable rapid large-scale data collection and more power to characterize individual differences, they also bring concerns about data quality, generalizability beyond online samples, and whether autistic traits can be reliably characterized with self-report measures administered online. Here we tackle these concerns by providing a systematic characterization of the autistic traits variability across individuals in a large cross-sectional dataset (N=2826) as well as its temporal reliability within individuals in a test-retest dataset (N=247), with both online and in-lab samples. We measured autistic traits using the Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd version, Adult Self Report (SRS-2-ASR) - a tool that quantifies individual differences in autistic traits along a continuum for the general adult population. Across individuals, we found elevated SRS scores in online samples and were able to trace this effect to specific subsets of SRS items. SRS scores also covaried with internalizing symptoms, decreased with age, and were lower in women compared to other genders. Within individuals, we find moderate-to-good test-retest reliability of SRS scores over long intervals, with no difference between online and in-lab samples, suggesting robust temporal stability. We conclude that there are systematic differences in autistic traits between online and in-lab samples that are partly explained by systematic population-level differences in internalizing symptoms, particularly social anxiety. Future studies that sample across different populations should measure, control for, or stratify with respect to these factors.",

Three key findings emerged. First, chatbot interviews generated significantly lower interviewee word counts than human interviews, limiting trait-relevant cues for raters and machine-based methods. Second, construct validity results demonstrated moderate convergence between machine-derived and human rater scores, with LLM-based scores performing comparably to human ratings. However, limited discriminant validity suggests that method effects outweigh trait-specific variance. Third, machine-derived scores demonstrated incremental validity in predicting organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB) beyond self-reported personality scores, underscoring their potential utility in selection contexts. These findings emphasize the need for refinements in chatbot design to elicit richer responses and improve scoring accuracy, offering promising implications for scalable and efficient personality assessments in organizational settings.",

          "authors": "Ashley Sylvara; Emily E. Gregg; Tianjun Sun",
          "abstract": "AI chatbots offer an interactive method to assess personality through semi-structured interviews. By leveraging natural language processing and machine learning, these chatbots can engage users in conversational exchanges, providing a more nuanced and contextual evaluation of personality traits. This study compares the psychometric validity of AI chatbot-based personality interviews with conventional methods, including scale-based measures and short essay questionnaires. We also examine how user perceptions of the AI chatbot influence the validity of machine-inferred personality scores. Data was collected from 189 Prolific participants at two time points. Adopting the multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) analytical framework and based on the generalizability theory (G-theory), we found that machine-inferred scores from both the short essay questionnaire and the AI chatbot interview converge well with scale-based methods but show weaker discriminant validity. Chatbot-based scores demonstrated incremental validity beyond other methods (i.e., scale-based and short essay scores) for predicting subjective health and perceived job performance. Preliminary findings suggest that ease of concentration during the chatbot interview may influence the convergence between scale-based and chatbot-based machine-inferred scores. Overall, our results support the use of AI chatbots for personality assessment while highlighting the need for further research on how user perceptions affect the psychometric properties of AI-based assessments.",

          "abstract": "The professionalisation of esports has led to increased investment in high-performance environments. However, differences in resources and infrastructure between major and minor regions pose significant challenges to achieving competitive parity. In this study, we aimed to explore key success factors in high-performance esports environments and develop a preliminary conceptual framework capturing the core elements of elite esports environments. Following semi-structured interviews with elite players (n = 10), coaches (n = 9), and support staff (n = 7) from major and minor esports regions, we generated three categories to represent key factors contributing to success in esports: training environment, interpersonal dynamics, and intrapersonal development. Major region players benefited from structured support, including dedicated training facilities, access to psychological services, and in-person team cohesion strategies. Alternatively, minor region players faced resource constraints, limited access to psychological and physical training, and appeared to be at increased risk of burnout. Based on the novel insights generated, we proposed a preliminary Esports High-Performance Model (EHPM), a multi-layered, context-specific framework that highlights the interconnectedness of the training environment, interpersonal dynamics, and intrapersonal development in high-performing esports environments. Our findings provide a foundation for future research and can be used to inform policies and practices supporting the development of sustainable, high-performance esports environments. We propose that the EHPM could be a promising way to address current challenges and consequences surfaced by disparities between minor and major regions, potentially aiding the rebalancing of the competitive landscape in esports and improving player well-being.",

          "abstract": "Cultural appropriation is a critique of cultural borrowing or outgroup cultural use, typically when a more powerful cultural group adopts cultural elements from a less powerful group. Accusations of appropriation have been fiercely debated in recent years, which raise questions about appropriate versus appropriative adoption of another group’s culture. We propose that these different evaluations hinge in part on diversity ideologies. In four studies of U.S. participants (total N = 1549), we examined the differing effects of three diversity ideologies (colorblindness, multiculturalism, and polyculturalism) on judgments of common cases of cultural appropriation. We found that multiculturalism was associated with harsher judgment, whereas colorblindness and polyculturalism were associated with more lenient judgment. Additionally, we explored perception of costs and benefits involved in cultural appropriation and found the associations between diversity ideologies and judgments to be mediated by perceived misrepresentation, permission, distinctiveness, and honorific intent. We conclude that each diversity ideology makes different tradeoffs salient in perceived costs and benefits of cultural use across groups.",

          "abstract": "Goal representation characterizes the cognitive structures people use to frame, perceive, and evaluate goals. Variance in goal representation provides meaningful insight into goal pursuit. However, the conceptual structure of this multifaceted construct has yet to be established. Most Goal-related theories and empirical research focus on a limited subset of dimensions, such as specificity or importance. The present project explores and evaluates the conceptual structure of goal representation using a data-driven meta-theoretical approach. We collected more than 2000 goals from 669 participants in three studies with college and online samples. In Studies 1-3, participants rated all their goals on 31 goal representation dimensions. In Study 3, participants completed three monthly follow-ups and rated all their goals again at the end. We independently conducted exploratory factor analysis in each study and extracted a four-component (Value, External Motive, Clarity, and Consensus) and a six-component structure. We evaluated the replicability and reliability of both structures. We found that all components from the four-component structure aligned across three studies and had moderate to high inter-rater reliability. All components from the six-component structure aligned between baseline and post-assessment at 3 months, and Value, External Motive, and Consensus had test-retest reliability &gt; .7. In Study 3, we found that External Motive and Attainability were positively associated with goal progress, but Value was not. Attainability was also positively associated with progress satisfaction. This project establishes a dimensional space to describe mental representations of goals and sets the foundations for future research to build tools to assess goal representation.",

          "abstract": "Whether it is the first day of school or a new job, individuals often find themselves in situations where they must learn and integrate into novel social relationships. However, the mechanisms through which individuals evaluate the strength and nature of these existing relationships – social-relational inference – remain unclear. We posit that linguistic features of conversations may help individuals evaluate social relationships and may be associated with social-relational inference. Leveraging a naturalistic behavioral experiment (57 adults; 34,735 observations), participants watched a mid-season episode of Survivor and evaluated the observed dyadic relationships between contestants. We employed novel person- and stimulus-focused approaches to 1) investigate social-relational inference similarity between participants, 2) examine the association between distinct linguistic features and social-relational inference, and 3) explore the relationship between early season conversation similarity and later perceived relationship formation. We found high pairwise participant response similarity across three experimental conditions, distinct associations between relational judgments and linguistic features, including semantic similarity, sentiment, and clout, and no evidence of an association between early conversation similarity and later friendship inference. These findings suggest that naturalistic conversational content is both a potential mechanism of social-relational inference and a promising avenue for future research.",

          "abstract": "This reply to Conway et al. (2025) illustrates how points of contention in the evaluation of mindreading (or Theory of Mind) measures can arise from the use of divergent validity concepts. The construct validity model used in Wendt and colleagues’ (2024) empirical study contrasts with the perspective implicit in Conway and colleagues' commentary, which is more consistent with Lennon's content validity model. This is reflected in the authors' conception of the nature of what is to be measured (i.e., the measurand), the criterion for what makes a measure superior (i.e., validity), and the proposed methods for judging this (i.e., validation). The mismatch between the validity concepts adopted by the respective authors has three major implications: First, Conway and colleagues' critique does not fully address the specific goals, assumptions, and intricacies of construct validation methodology. Second, their approach to measuring mindreading should not be confused with, or considered as an alternative to, construct validation, but is valuable in its own right. Third, the two validity frameworks mentioned offer unique opportunities for different phases of the research process. While a content validity approach can be valuable for describing an empirical phenomenon that seems worthy of explanation (e.g., real-world mindreading), a construct validity approach helps identify the theoretical constructs that might help explain it (e.g., mindreading ability).",

          "abstract": "Researchers often want to measure a broad variety of constructs such as anxiety, discrimination, or loneliness in text data from surveys, academic articles, interviews, social media, and electronic health records. In practice, using large language models (LLMs) remain infeasible for many researchers due to concerns around privacy, cost, compute requirements, and computational expertise, and may prefer interpretable models to avoid mistakes in high-stakes scenarios. Lexicons offer a simpler solution by counting relevant words and phrases, making them very popular in the social sciences and as baseline models in computer science.  Existing lexicons are limited because they measure a fixed set of constructs that are unlikely to cover the specific constructs of interest for a given application, resulting in low content validity. Building and validating new lexicons is resource intensive. In this study, we found that GPT-4 turbo was able to automatically create a lexicon for 49 known risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, which we release as the Suicide Risk Lexicon. We used the lexicon counts to predict risk levels in crisis counseling conversations. After validating it with experts, our model outperformed the widely-used LIWC lexicon and performed similarly to deep learning models. Through feature importance analysis, we discovered that active suicidal ideation, suicidal planning, and direct self-injury were stronger indicators of imminent risk than passive suicidal ideation or depressed mood. To simplify creating and validating new lexicons for any domain of research, we introduce a protocol and Python package, construct-tracker, that works with a variety of generative AI models.",

While research-grade infrared eye-trackers are commonly used, there are a number of issues that limit its wide-spread adoption. Recently, consumer-based webcam eye-tracking has emerged as an attractive alternative, requiring only internet access and a personal webcam. However, webcam eye-tracking presents unique design and preprocessing challenges that must be addressed for valid results. To help researchers overcome these challenges, we developed a comprehensive tutorial focused on visual world  webcam eye-tracking for L2 language research. Our guide will cover all key steps, from design to data preprocessing and analysis, where we highlight the R package `webgazeR`, which is open source and freely available for download and installation: https://github.com/jgeller112/webgazeR. We offer best practices for environmental conditions, participant instructions, and tips for designing visual world experiments with webcam eye-tracking. To demonstrate these steps, we analyze data collected through the Gorilla platform (Anwyl-Irvine et al., 2020) using a single word Spanish visual world paradigm (VWP) and show competition within and between L2/L1. This tutorial aims to empower researchers by providing a step-by-step guide to successfully conduct visual world  webcam-based eye-tracking studies.

          "abstract": "Context. Many spiritual traditions, like Buddhism, emphasize the importance of developing feelings of love and altruism toward others regardless of circumstances, but doing so can be challenging, especially in situations where individuals have little self-control resources, for example due to cognitive fatigue. These traditions offer techniques to train the mind, such as loving-kindness meditation, in order to facilitate the achievement of this altruistic goal. However, the evidence in favour of the prosocial benefits of loving-kindness meditation is scant and at times conflicting. Methods. To investigate the long-term effects of loving-kindness training on prosociality and aggression, we investigated changes in a range of prosocial variables at pre, post, and follow-up in a preregistered randomized controlled trial comparing three groups: loving-kindness meditation (N = 58), loving-kindness reflection (N = 53), and waitlist control (N = 92). Furthermore, to establish the robustness of the loving-kindness training relative to challenging circumstances such as cognitive fatigue, we introduced an ego depletion task at post-testing. Results. Planned contrasts analyses suggested effects on positive affect only for the meditation group, on self-reported compassion for both the meditation and reflection groups, and explicit social attitudes, aggressive behaviour, cognitive accessibility of a recent altruistic behaviour, willingness to help, only for the reflection group. There were no other group differences in attitudes toward aggression, dehumanization, implicit aggression, or charity donations. Moderation analyses revealed three-way interactions between group, implicit attitudes, and ego depletion, as hypothesized, but only for compassion and cognitive accessibility of a recent altruistic behaviour. Discussion. In conclusion, results suggest that the effects of reflecting on loving-kindness concepts provide robust and reliable prosocial effects, perhaps more than meditating on those concepts. Even those benefits are limited to certain behaviours, cognitions, or affects, and they do not generalize to many common behaviours such as charity donations. However, ego depletion seems to only moderate implicit attitudes when loving-kindness is embodied through meditation and not when it is confined to the intellectual mind.",

The results of our investigation indicated that all five of the scales are reliable and valid measures of conspiracist ideation. That said, the GCB-5 tended to perform the best while the 1CM tended to perform the worst.

          "abstract": "Successfully navigating the social world requires making accurate predictions about others. Individual differences in emotion prediction–the ability to predict someone’s subsequent emotion given their current emotional state–can lead to variability in social success. Across three studies (N = 1,024) we found evidence that individuals with heightened schizotypy displayed worse emotion prediction accuracy. This difficulty with emotion prediction was associated with increased loneliness, diminished social support, and smaller social networks, partially mediating some of the social difficulties in individuals with heightened schizotypy. Individuals with heightened schizotypy showed disruptions to key sources of affective information, meaning they had less reliable information about how emotions work when making emotion predictions. Specifically, their own emotion experiences were less typical, and their perception of others’ emotions was less accurate. These findings highlight emotion prediction as a key social cognitive construct that should be considered in future research for individuals across the schizophrenia spectrum.",

          "abstract": "Creative processes of semantic extension play a key role in language change, grammaticalisation, and (by hypothesis) the early origins and evolution of language. In this paper we report two dyadic interaction experiments studying the semantic extension of novel labels in controlled circumstances. We find that participants can use salient and shared associations in their perceptual environment (between colours and shapes) to bootstrap a communication system, and can then extend those labels figuratively, to convey both concrete and abstract targets, by exploiting shared understandings such as colours associated stereotypically with specific objects and emotions. By manipulating the presence of reliable statistical associations between colour and shape early in this process we show that such shared associations facilitate both an initial semantic extension and subsequent chaining of extensions; we also find that extensions relying on less certain grounding (e.g. between colours and emotions) lead to greater variability in how extensions are made. Our method can be used to test the creative processes of semantic extension under controlled conditions, and provides experimental purchase on the relationship between association and extension which have only previously been studied through correlational means.",

          "abstract": "Some authors argue that filled pauses serve a communicative function in speech. The current study aims to test this function by analysing the difference in filler-use in a self-directed and social speech condition. Additionally, the influence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) traits and stress on the difference in filler-use between the two conditions were examined. In the first condition, participants described a series of different tangrams to themselves. In the second condition, participants described tangrams to another participant. More words and filled pauses were used when talking to someone else, but there were no more filled pauses per word. This suggests that filled pauses do not primarily serve as communicative signals. Instead they indicate that at least to some extent, they appear involuntary and automatically as a result of errors in the language production system. Furthermore, no significant correlation was found between the score on the ASD questionnaire or stress and the difference in fillers used in both speech conditions. Future research should consider experimental designs that more clearly differentiate between the presence or absence of a communicative goal, as the context of a monologue may still provide speakers with reasons to use communicative signals.",

Measurement best practices have long been overlooked in ESM research, and recent reviews show that item quality is often not reported in ESM studies. The absence of information about item quality may partly be explained by the lack of consensus on how ESM item quality should be evaluated. As part of the ESM Item Repository project (esmitemrepository.com) — an international open science initiative that collects ESM items in an open item bank and evaluates their quality — we brought together 42 international ESM experts to develop an ESM item quality assessment tool. In four Delphi phases, experts suggested 57 item quality criteria, rated the criteria, provided arguments for and against the criteria, and rated the criteria again, considering reflections from other experts. The result of the Delphi process is ESM-Q: A quality assessment tool consisting of 10 core criteria, as well as an additional 15 supplementary criteria, to be used depending on the type of items being rated and the availability of supplementary information. The criteria cover topics ranging from construct validity to the optimal wording of items. ESM-Q can aid ESM researchers in selecting existing ESM items, developing new high-quality ESM items, and evaluating the quality of ESM items in systematic reviews. Expert reflections also highlight open research questions surrounding ESM item design that form a research agenda for ESM measurement.",

          "authors": "Rémi Thériault; Romane Masson; Stéphane Dandeneau",
          "abstract": "Context. Many spiritual traditions, like Buddhism, emphasize the importance of developing feelings of love and altruism toward others regardless of circumstances, but doing so can be challenging, especially in situations where individuals have little self-control resources, for example due to cognitive fatigue. These traditions offer techniques to train the mind, such as loving-kindness meditation, in order to facilitate the achievement of this altruistic goal. However, the evidence in favour of the prosocial benefits of loving-kindness meditation is scant and at times conflicting. Methods. To investigate the long-term effects of loving-kindness training on prosociality and aggression, we investigated changes in a range of prosocial variables at pre, post, and follow-up in a preregistered randomized controlled trial comparing three groups: loving-kindness meditation (N = 58), loving-kindness reflection (N = 53), and waitlist control (N = 92). Furthermore, to establish the robustness of the loving-kindness training relative to challenging circumstances such as cognitive fatigue, we introduced an ego depletion task at post-testing. Results. Planned contrasts analyses suggested effects on positive affect only for the meditation group, on self-reported compassion for both the meditation and reflection groups, and explicit social attitudes, aggressive behaviour, cognitive accessibility of a recent altruistic behaviour, willingness to help, only for the reflection group. There were no other group differences in attitudes toward aggression, dehumanization, implicit aggression, or charity donations. Moderation analyses revealed three-way interactions between group, implicit attitudes, and ego depletion, as hypothesized, but only for compassion and cognitive accessibility of a recent altruistic behaviour. Discussion. In conclusion, results suggest that the effects of reflecting on loving-kindness concepts provide robust and reliable prosocial effects, perhaps more than meditating on those concepts. Even those benefits are limited to certain behaviours, cognitions, or affects, and they do not generalize to many common behaviours such as charity donations. However, ego depletion seems to only moderate implicit attitudes when loving-kindness is embodied through meditation and not when it is confined to the intellectual mind.",

          "abstract": "Conspiracy beliefs are widely considered resistant to factual correction, yet recent research shows that relatively brief, personalized “debunking” dialogues with a generative AI model can substantially reduce such beliefs. To identify the mechanisms driving this effect, we conducted an experiment spanning eight treatment arms that varied key features of participants’ interactions with GPT-4 during such debunking dialogues (N = 1,297). The debunking effect proved robust across most manipulations—including whether participants were explicitly told the AI aimed to change their minds, were asked to debate the AI, or whether the AI offered them factual information without otherwise seeking to persuade or was concise in its exposition. The only condition that undermined the debunking effect was prompting the AI to persuade participants without presenting any counterevidence, which yielded a null effect. Furthermore, analyses of the AI’s persuasive strategies identified reasoning-based tactics as the sole significant mediator of belief change. Participants who reported feeling persuaded overwhelmingly cited the AI’s rational, evidence-focused approach. Finally, participants higher in actively open-minded thinking showed larger treatment effects. These findings suggest that AI-driven interventions reduce conspiracy beliefs principally by providing factual, targeted counterarguments that address the specific reasons people hold these beliefs.",

In Study 2 (pre-registered; N = 984), we found similar evidence for cultural differences comparing samples of Chinese and Japanese adults currently living in East Asia to adults currently living in the United States.

Both hearing loss and aging may degrade pitch perception, potentially affecting the ability to detect mistuning. For younger listeners with normal hearing, mistuning perception in music relies on both beats (amplitude fluctuations between closely spaced frequency components) and inharmonicity (non-integer frequency relationships between components from different sources). This study investigated the associations between hearing loss and age with mistuning detection in music, as well as with beat and inharmonicity detection. We tested groups of younger and older listeners with normal hearing and older listeners with hearing loss (N = 91 total). Results showed that older listeners with normal hearing performed similarly to younger listeners. In contrast, hearing loss was associated with poorer mistuning detection but was not associated with poorer performance in our measures of beat or inharmonicity detection. Reduction of either beating or inharmonicity cues in music had comparable effects across all groups. Overall, the results suggest that hearing loss, but not age, is associated with poorer mistuning detection in music, but that similar cues are used by all groups to detect mistuning.",

          "authors": "Onur Sahin",
          "abstract": "In this dissertation, I investigate how being different from the majority of one’s colleagues shapes social inclusion perceptions at work. In Chapter 1, I introduce the relational demography approach and ingroup projection model as the frameworks of my dissertation and summarize the methods, findings, and broader implications of the empirical chapters that follow. In these chapters, I utilize a multi-method approach consisting of desk research, experimental studies, and large-scale correlational studies to offer six significant contributions to the literature. First, in Chapter 2, an analysis of diversity statements of 84 Dutch private and public organizations showed that most statements include both surface-level (readily visible, such as gender and ethnicity) and deep-level dimensions (more underlying, such as personality and sexual orientation). However, surface-level dimensions were more often included, without clear differences between statements of private and public organizations. Second, in Chapter 3, experimental studies (N = 128 in Study 1; N = 196 in Study 2, recruited via Prolific) established the causal relationship between dissimilarity and social inclusion. Third, in Chapter 4, a survey study with 887 employees of a public organization in the Netherlands revealed that deep-level dissimilarity, rather than surface-level dissimilarity, related to social inclusion and that inclusion explained the relationships between dissimilarity and work-related outcomes. Fourth, in Chapter 5, a survey study with 6,312 employees of another Dutch public organization accounted for multidimensionality and revealed that as employees perceived dissimilarity on more dimensions, they perceived less inclusion. Furthermore, the results showed that dissimilarity in personality, ethnicity/cultural background, age, level of education, work experience, and disability negatively related to perceptions of inclusion, offering a more nuanced understanding of the dissimilarity-inclusion relationship. Fifth, a review of the relational demography literature in Chapter 6 identified four general mechanisms theorized to explain why dissimilarity relates to outcomes: 1) uncertainty, 2) trust, 3) disapproval, and 4) initiated interaction between colleagues. A survey study with 2,409 UK residents (recruited via Prolific) confirmed that all four mechanisms uniquely explained the dissimilarity-inclusion relationship. Sixth, and finally, I found support for the indispensable role of the organizational climate for inclusion across Chapters 4, 5 and 6. In these chapters, a positive climate for inclusion buffered the negative relationships between dissimilarity and outcomes. My research argues for a broader consideration of dissimilarity dimensions beyond the dimensions diversity policies typically focus on, emphasizing the importance of recognizing multidimensionality and the crucial contextual role of climate for inclusion. This dissertation not only enriches our understanding of workplace diversity, but also offers actionable opportunities to mitigate social inclusion disparities.",

The general tips provided tips on how to spot misinformation, while the specific tips provided more detailed tips for how to detect AIVM. Results showed that specific tips increased headline discernment between true and false information more than general tips. Both media literacy interventions reduced belief in AIVM compared to control, but specific tips reduced belief in AIVM more than general tips. Finally, both specific and general tips also reduced belief in real headlines compared to control, with no difference between them.

          "abstract": "Abstract. In recent years, neuroscience-based methodologies have influenced architectural planning and urban studies. Since spaces are designed around proxemic relationships, studying mind-environment interactions can offer new design approaches for human spaces. Furthermore, with the prevalence of COVID-19 and the “social distancing” policy recommended by WHO, its application may affect proxemic presuppositions. Consequently, this may change individual and social proxemic distances, followed by new dimensions in urban space components. This paper addresses the hypothetical changes in mental proxemics in the face of pandemic social distancing restrictions. This study examines and measures the mental proxemics of individuals at personal and social distances in urban spaces. The research method is quasi-experimental; primary data were collected through testing participants with a portable EEG (Electroencephalogram) device, questionnaires, and library studies. All subjects were randomly selected, and the study samples were paired before participating in the designed test. The findings demonstrated that the mental proxemics of individuals at social distances were affected during the COVID-19 period. However, to define the exact amount of variation, further tasks should be implemented. These changes could influence the effective dimensions in the design of urban furniture to achieve soothing distances in urban life.",

School environment, neighborhood education child opportunity index, neighborhood cohesion, and access to green space were tested as moderators of the association of neighborhood adversity with outcomes. \n\nResults\nHigher access/quality of educational resources buffer the association of neighborhood deprivation with crystallized cognitive performance. Supportive school environments were associated with lower externalizing symptoms, particularly for youth in low threat contexts. Further, for racial/ethnic minority youth living in low-segregation neighborhoods, higher neighborhood access/quality of educational resources related to lower internalizing symptoms.\n\nConclusion\nWhile adverse neighborhood environments are associated with higher psychopathology symptoms and lower cognitive performance, some aspects of neighborhoods may buffer this association. Understanding these patterns is necessary for informing structural interventions that might reduce disparities in mental health and cognitive function.",

          "abstract": "Eye-tracking has become a valuable tool for studying cognitive processes in second language (L2) acquisition and bilingualism (Godfroid et al., 2024). While research-grade infrared eye-trackers are commonly used, there are a number of issues that limit its wide-spread adoption. Recently, consumer-based webcam eye-tracking has emerged as an attractive alternative, requiring only internet access and a personal webcam. However, webcam eye-tracking presents unique design and preprocessing challenges that must be addressed for valid results. To help researchers overcome these challenges, we developed a comprehensive tutorial focused on visual world  webcam eye-tracking for L2 language research. Our guide will cover all key steps, from design to data preprocessing and analysis, where we highlight the R package `webgazeR`, which is open source and freely available for download and installation: https://github.com/jgeller112/webgazeR. We offer best practices for environmental conditions, participant instructions, and tips for designing visual world experiments with webcam eye-tracking. To demonstrate these steps, we analyze data collected through the Gorilla platform (Anwyl-Irvine et al., 2020) using a single word Spanish visual world paradigm (VWP) and show competition within and between L2/L1. This tutorial aims to empower researchers by providing a step-by-step guide to successfully conduct visual world  webcam-based eye-tracking studies.

          "abstract": "Motor learning researchers have shown that people directed to use externally focused cues perform better than those directed to use internally focused cues. The effects of external and internal self-talk have not been systematically explored in the sport psychology self-talk literature. This meta-analysis was designed to evaluate instructional self-talk in sport by comparing: (a) general instructional self-talk to motivational and no or unrelated self-talk; and (b) external instructional self-talk to other types of instructional self-talk. A database search yielded 32 studies that met the inclusion criteria for quantitative analysis. Effect sizes were calculated and categorized as: instructional self-talk, motivational self-talk, and control. Risk of bias assessment analysis showed that all 32 of the self-talk studies were at high-risk of bias. Regarding the effects of self-talk on performance, both instructional and motivational self-talk enhanced motor performance compared to no or unrelated self-talk groups. Moderator analysis revealed that the effect of external instructional self-talk was significantly larger than internal, not purely external, or unclear instructional self-talk. Based on these findings, sport psychology research directly comparing external to internal instructional self-talk and control conditions is justified. Sport psychology researchers should consider bias assessment and management in their sport self-talk research.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated the temporal dynamics of retro-cue benefits (RCBs) in visual working memory (VWM), focusing on the differential effectiveness of feature-based (color and orientation) and spatial retro-cues. Across four experiments, we systematically varied cue-probe delays to compare how rapidly and effectively these cue types enhanced memory performance. Results showed that both feature-based and spatial retro-cues improved memory performance when sufficient time was provided, but the timing and magnitude of RCBs varied significantly by cue type and feature properties. Color-based retro-cues generated RCBs more rapidly than spatial cues, likely due to the automatic processing of color. In contrast, orientation-based retro-cues required longer delays to produce benefits, reflecting their reliance on sequential attentional processes. Spatial cues, while efficient, required additional time to convert positional information into memory representations. These findings highlight the critical role of cue properties in determining the temporal efficiency of RCBs and suggest that feature-based retro-cues are not a homogeneous category, as their effectiveness varies depending on the inherent attributes of the feature. The study emphasizes the need for feature-specific frameworks in designing VWM experiments and models, particularly when examining the mechanisms of retro-cueing.",

          "abstract": "Dominant groups often resist possible changes to the hierarchical status quo. Might such tendencies be partly rooted in negative—yet potentially malleable—meta-beliefs about how disempowered groups would use power if they gained control? We investigate these questions across three studies and eight independent samples (Total N = 7,460 analyzed responses) in the context of Black-White relations in the United States. Specifically, we examine White Americans’ meta-beliefs about whether Black Americans desire power to structure society into a hierarchy in which they are dominant versus to institute equality for all groups (i.e., meta-dominance beliefs). Across 6 cross-sectional sub-samples (Study 1, Samples A-F; N = 3,383), we developed and validated a measure of meta-dominance, and found that White Americans varied substantially in their beliefs about how Black Americans would use power. Critically, Whites’ meta-dominance beliefs were uniquely related to their opposition to policies empowering Black Americans as well as their support for efforts to maintain Whites’ position atop the social hierarchy, even when controlling for a range of relevant constructs. In two pre-registered experiments among White Americans (Studies 2-3; N = 4,077), one of which was a registered report, we tested two possible causal pathways that might explain this relation: (1) “Meta-Dominance Beliefs leads to Opposition to Black Empowerment” and (2) “Opposition to Black Empowerment leads to Meta-Dominance Beliefs”. We found evidence in support of the “Meta-Dominance Beliefs leads to Opposition to Black Empowerment” pathway, but not for the latter Opposition to Black Empowerment leads to Meta-Dominance Beliefs” pathway. We discuss our findings’ implications for theories of hierarchy-maintenance.",

          "abstract": "Trust involves making oneself vulnerable by relying on the expectation that others will reciprocate and act in a trustworthy manner, leading to mutual benefit. In behavioral economics and psychology, the Trust Game is a widely used paradigm to measure trust. The repeated Trust Game is a modified version of the Trust Game in which participants encounter the same partner(s) multiple times, allowing for reputation and trust learning. The aim of the present meta analysis was to identify features of the repeated Trust Game, participant characteristics, and manipulations of partner trustworthiness that affect trust learning. This is the first meta-analytic study to specifically assess trust learning in the repeated Trust Game and included 404 effect sizes from over 8,000 participants from 68 studies. Our findings indicate that the partners’ behavioral trustworthiness, in the form of their reciprocation rate, is by far the most influential factor in participant trust learning (β = 3.0). Furthermore, the results reveal that manipulating prior information about partners can have an effect on the amount of learning, but only for manipulations of trustworthiness/morality. Notably, in ingroup-outgroup studies, participants learn from their partners’ trustworthiness and it is not affected by their partners’ group membership.",

In Study 2, we found that Gen-AI assistance significantly enhanced the slogan quality for less creative individuals. However, the latter Gen-AI enhancement was not realized by egocentric creators (objectively less creative but self-reporting high subjective creativity). The egocentric creators also preferred their own lower quality slogans over the ones provided by Chat-GPT4.

However, this behavior is infrequent in high-income countries, especially among younger adults who often lack practical repair skills. In this quasi-experiment, we tested whether a group workshop could motivate repair and reduce consumption in young adults. Participants were assigned to a skills workshop (n = 62) or a control group (n = 51) who only received a persuasive message about clothing repair. The workshop strongly increased self-efficacy both immediately after the workshop and four weeks later. Although the workshop did not impact environmental attitudes or emotions associated with repair, workshop participants reported moderately higher intentions to repair their clothes and identified more with others who did (but these effects were not durable). The workshop did not increase the number of self-reported repairs nor reduce purchases four weeks later. There was some evidence for lower disposals at follow-up (but the effect was uncertain). A single workshop may thus spark motivation but not materialize in behavior changes four weeks later. This study highlights the importance of hands-on practice for boosting self-efficacy and demonstrates how quasi-experimental designs with follow-up surveys can contribute to understanding the potential of behavioral interventions.",

However, it has not been investigated whether identity processes, as described by this model, are general across various domains or domain-specific.The main objective of this study was to address this gap in knowledge by exploring whether identity processes, as described by the model, are general or specific across the domains of future goals related to education and friendship. Further objectives included testing the five-dimensional dual-cycle model among young people in Serbia and deriving identity statuses based on the identity processes in these two domains. Two adapted versions of the Dimensions of Identity Development Scale (DIDS) were created: one for future goals related to education and another for future goals related to friendship. The sample consisted of 955 high school and university students. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed a domain-specific identity processes model, which included the five original factors of the DIDS. Configural, metric, and scalar invariance across gender were established. Cluster analysis identified six identity statuses: troubled diffusion, carefree diffusion, foreclosure, ruminative moratorium, achievement, and a cluster representing a combination of educational foreclosure and friendship carefree diffusion. The findings suggest that identity processes, according to the five-dimensional dual-cycle model, are domain-specific. However, identity statuses across the domains of future goals related to education and friendship are congruent for the majority of individuals. These results highlight the importance of exploring both domain-specific and shared factors in identity development in future research.",

          "authors": "Nicole Methner; Melanie C. Steffens; Susanne Bruckmüller",
          "abstract": "Trust lies at the heart of human interaction and of societies in general. Multiple research fields within and beyond psychology address trust as a research topic. However, even within psychology, different traditions have developed various and sometimes (apparently) contradictory perspectives on trust. This includes such different approaches as trust as choice behavior and trust as evaluation and has led to various inconsistencies in findings and methods. This review reconciles such different approaches, systematizes the heterogeneity of concepts, and raises new questions for future research by approaching trust from a social attitude perspective. Specifically, we suggest drawing parallels to attitude research, as both concepts share core characteristics. For instance, both attitudes and trust can be conceptualized as having cognitive, affective, and behavioral components, and on different abstraction levels. Based on these and other such parallels, we illustrate how insights from the attitude framework suggest solutions to key puzzles in trust research. That is, we show how previous debates and problems in attitude research, such as attitude-behavior-inconsistencies, and the solutions that have been developed for them, can help resolve similar issues in trust research, such as the inconsistent findings between self-reported trust and trust behavior. We also draw on the attitude framework to reveal unstudied questions and to outline promising avenues for future trust research (e.g., by drawing on insights from self-perception theory). Overall, using the attitude framework to build bridges between various streams of trust research is a promising start towards a comprehensive understanding of trust that can considerably benefit future trust research in various research fields.",

Drawing on ethnographic, historical, and psychological evidence, I explore the cultural manifestations and cognitive foundations of these narratives. The analysis highlights the roles of cognitive biases such as rosy retrospection and narrative inflation, as well as the strategic use of temporal distancing to rationalize fantastical beliefs by situating them in a distant, unfalsifiable past. By comparing decline narratives in traditional societies with progress narratives in modern, industrialized contexts, I discuss how these contrasting frameworks shape cultural attitudes toward tradition and change and consider their broader implications for understanding how cultural narratives influence human behavior.",

Although behavioural and self-report trait measures of curiosity have rarely been assessed within the same study, recent years have seen the beginning of such an endeavour, and this integration could permit cross-pollination of ideas and hypotheses for future research. After providing a brief review of behavioral and self-report measures of curiosity, I summarise how current evidence supports only mild overlap between the two measurement methods, with positive relations depending on the particular task measure and particular facet of trait curiosity chosen. Divergence between task and trait measures could suggest different cognitive/emotional mechanisms supporting the need to know.

          "abstract": "The most pressing issues we face involve resolving conflict between our moral beliefs. However, the mechanism by which agents evaluate moral trade-offs is poorly understood. We extend and test a psychological framework of moral trade-offs, under which judgment is a product of revising relevant beliefs to achieve coherence, in response to structural constraints imposed by the decision problem. Whilst traditional applications of coherence to moral judgements have been post-hoc, coherence on our view is causally involved in judgement. We develop a novel experimental dilemma concerning the issue of climate justice, which enables decision relevant beliefs to be measured before and after the dilemma is evaluated. We also estimate the coherence between these beliefs and their consistency with available choice options. Across two studies (N= 851) we examine the core predictions of this framework, including the causal role of coherence-based belief change in moral judgement. In both studies, participants re-evaluated their beliefs to become more internally coherent and more consistent with their judgement, polarising the beliefs of participants reaching competing conclusions. Coherence and consistency also separately predicted metacognitive properties of judgement such as confidence and perceived task difficulty. Network analyses demonstrated a restructuring of the belief network and an increase in the strength of partial associations between beliefs over judgement. Overall, these results provide strong support for a coherence-based framework of moral trade-offs. Whilst judgement involves revising beliefs to achieve a coherent arrangement, the choice option selected depends on the aggregate weight of these beliefs once the revision process is completed.",

This study aimed to enhance the understanding of attachment security and belonging as protective factors against depression in LGBTQ+ adults. Using a correlational, survey-based design (N = 364), we examined whether a sense of belonging (SOB) to the LGBTQ+ community mediates the association between attachment security and depression and whether this mediation varies across levels of SOB to the general community. Regression model results generated with Hayes’s PROCESS macro for SPSS indicated that SOB to the LGBTQ+ Community mediated the negative association between attachment security and depression, providing support for this protective mechanism and conceptually replicating prior research. No evidence emerged that this mediation effect varied with SOB to the general community. Exploratory analyses suggested that anxious and avoidant attachment may differ in the extent to which SOB to the LGBTQ+ and general communities mediate their relationships with depression. Despite appropriate statistical power, the study’s cross-sectional nature limits causal inferences. The findings have implications for addressing health inequities, increasing access to LGBTQ+ Community resources, and promoting LGBTQ+ well-being.",

          "abstract": "Humans are generally biased to show implicit favoritism for in-group over out-group members, but developmental experiences may alter this process in important ways. Prior work has elucidated associations of family (i.e., in-group) violence exposure in childhood with risk for internalizing symptoms through weakened implicit favoritism for novel in-group members. The present study probes whether childhood violence exposure influences implicit bias and psychopathology differentially depending on the participant’s relationship with the perpetrator (i.e., in-group vs. out-group member) at the time of exposure. We administered a minimal group assignment paradigm and implicit association test to 455 young adults aged 18-25. Young adults who experienced out-group violence in childhood showed stronger implicit in-group favoritism compared to those who experienced in-group or no violence. Implicit out-group favoritism was associated with increased alcohol use. Early-life experiences may shape innate preferences for novel in-group vs. out-group members in ways that have lasting implications for mental health.",

Despite considerable research on empathy, we know surprisingly little about how trait measures relate to real-world empathic experiences. In this preregistered analysis of 7,343 experience sampling surveys from a near-representative sample of 246 U.S. adults, we map the connections between validated trait empathy measures and state experiences of empathy. Each component of state empathy—including emotion sharing, perspective taking, and compassion—was significantly predicted by theoretically-relevant trait measures. However, trait empathy explained limited variance in daily experiences overall, ranging from just 3% for emotion sharing to 15% for perceived empathic efficacy. Adding emotional valence as a predictor improved model fit and variance explained for most state experiences, highlighting the crucial role of context. Our findings validate trait empathy measures while revealing their limitations in predicting real-world experiences.",

Consequently, prior work primarily examined stereotype content as a function of group labels, overlooking how stereotypes vary across perceivers, situations, and intersecting categories. To address this gap, we conducted two pre-registered studies with U.S. representative participants (N = 1,721) who freely wrote stories about how other people generally view 9 groups across 6 representative situations and 30 intersectional categories. We analyzed these stories using large language models. We found that although stereotypes are considered products of social learning about groups, they varied considerably across perceivers and situations. Intersectional stereotypes showed evidence for dominance effects of “Asian” and “unattractiveness”, potentially due to their lower representativeness in the U.S. population and uniform stereotypes across situations. These findings highlight the complex variability of stereotype content in naturalistic contexts, opening new doors to reducing intergroup biases.",

          "abstract": "Developmental dyslexia (DD) is characterized by difficulties in reading due to a core impairment in phonological awareness. The clinical manifestation also includes a more general auditory verbal short-term memory (vSTM) dysfunction. However, little is known about the behavioral and brain basis of vSTM deficits in children with dyslexia, failing to understand factors that may account for co-occurrence of deficits or substantial heterogeneity within DD. \nThe study identified deficiencies in vSTM within a large cohort of children with DD and examined their neuroanatomical alterations. 81 children with DD and 17 typically developing (TD) children completed an experimental repetition task, which evaluated two components of phrases, namely length (6 and 9 syllable phrases) and meaning (more or less meaningful phrases). In addition, a battery of reading, phonological, and verbal memory tasks was administered to DD children, which were used for preliminary examination of different subtypes of dyslexia.  Structural brain T1-weighted MR images were analyzed to investigate the neural correlates of vSTM deficit in children with DD. \nBehavioral results showed that children with DD had impaired phrase repetition compared to TD, especially when repeating long and non-meaningful phrases. Crucially, lower repetition performance on long or non-meaningful phrases was associated with greater cortical thickness in the left temporoparietal area in children with DD. Finally, two distinct DD subtypes with disproportional deficits in phonology and vSTM were identified, demonstrating different repetition patterns. Those with primary vSTM deficits showed lower repetition performance and decreased cortical thickness in the left precentral gyrus compared to those with primary phonological processing deficits. This study covers topics central to understanding neurocognitive diversity in dyslexia and may suggest that verbal memory ability may be an important area for future intervention.",

To answer this important question, we develop a theoretical framework based on two popular evaluation methods in eyewitness research—receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and expected utility analysis. This framework contains two key components. First, we present an investigator signal detection model, which illustrates that ROC analysis examines investigator performance rather than eyewitness performance. Investigators use eyewitness evidence to classify suspects’ guilt or innocence—and lineup ROC curves capture their operating characteristics under different decision criteria. Second, we discuss the connection between ROC and expected utility, which highlights the dynamic nature of investigator decision making. The expected utility of investigator classification decisions is influenced not only by the quality of eyewitness evidence but also by factors such as investigators’ decision criteria, prior evidence, and consequences of the decisions. As its parameters embrace police investigative practices throughout different stages, the expected utility approach provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating investigator performance. To effectively evaluate and improve lineup practices, researchers need to consider not just witnesses but also the role played by investigators.",

Leveraging a mixed-methods approach, this pre-registered study characterized youths’ self-reported barriers to accessing mental healthcare in a socio-demographically diverse sample of 123 United States adolescents (ages 13-16, identifying as Asian (n=19), Hispanic (n=23), Black (n=7), White (n=65), or other race (n=9); man (n=9), woman (n=58), or gender minority (n=56); heterosexual (n=19) or sexual orientation minority (n=104)). All participants were experiencing elevated depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-2 score of ≥2) and endorsed wanting mental health support but being unable to access it. We asked participants an open-ended question gauging perceived barriers to accessing care (“what has kept you from getting support when you wanted it?”), and a binary item gauging perceived current need for mental health support (“right now, do you feel that you need support for emotional or mental health problems?”). Via thematic analysis of responses to the perceived barriers question, we identified a total of 13 categories of barriers. Across all participants, 42.48% (n=52) endorsed family-related barriers and 31.71% (n=39) endorsed finance-related concerns. We conducted Chi-square analyses, examining rates of endorsing specific barriers as a function of (a) perceived current support need and (b) demographic variables (e.g. race/ethnicity, gender). In the current study, all adolescents endorsed similar categories of treatment access barriers, regardless of race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and level of depression. Implications for increasing mental healthcare access for adolescents with elevated depression symptoms are discussed.",

Person-centered approaches can be used to quantify this developmental heterogeneity and challenge deficit-centered frameworks. This study leverages person-centered and data-driven methods to quantify and characterize cognitive heterogeneity in a socioeconomically diverse dataset of early adolescents from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development℠ Study (N = 9,839; 47.7% female sex; Mage = 9.90 years; 46.7% White). Four profiles based on access to socioeconomic resources (SER) and multi-domain cognitive functioning were identified, including two profiles characterized by moderate-to-high-SER (74.5%) and two profiles characterized by low-SER (25.5%). Among youth in low-SER environments, 88.6% demonstrated cognitive performance scores similar to youth with moderate-to-high access to SER (“cognitive resilience”), whereas 11.4% demonstrated markedly lower performance relative to the other profiles (i.e., 1.3 to 2.3 SD below the sample mean; “cognitive vulnerability”). Ridge regression identified ecological factors associated with profile membership at the individual level and within family, neighborhood, and school contexts. Suburban residence (odds ratio [OR] = 1.30), advanced pubertal maturity (OR = 1.20), bilingualism (OR = 1.14), and greater caregiver monitoring (OR = 1.10) were most strongly associated with lower-SER youths’ membership in the resilient versus the vulnerable profile. Results emphasize the need to challenge deficit-centered frameworks by investigating heterogeneity within adversity-exposed youth and identifying context-specific risk and protective factors.",

          "abstract": "Eye-tracking has become a valuable tool for studying cognitive processes in second language (L2) acquisition and bilingualism (Godfroid et al., 2024). While research-grade infrared eye-trackers are commonly used, there are a number of issues that limit its wide-spread adoption. Recently, consumer-based webcam eye-tracking has emerged as an attractive alternative, requiring only internet access and a personal webcam. However, webcam eye-tracking presents unique design and preprocessing challenges that must be addressed for valid results. To help researchers overcome these challenges, we developed a comprehensive tutorial focused on visual world  webcam eye-tracking for L2 language research. Our guide will cover all key steps, from design to data preprocessing and analysis, where we highlight the R package `webgazeR`, which is open source and freely available for download and installation: https://github.com/jgeller112/webgazeR. We offer best practices for environmental conditions, participant instructions, and tips for designing visual world experiments with webcam eye-tracking. To demonstrate these steps, we analyze data collected through the Gorilla platform (Anwyl-Irvine et al., 2020) using a single word Spanish visual world paradigm (VWP) and show competition within and between L2/L1. This tutorial aims to empower researchers by providing a step-by-step guide to successfully conduct visual world  webcam-based eye-tracking studies.

          "abstract": "Perseverative thought (also known as repetitive thought) is an established transdiagnostic mechanism of internalizing psychopathology characterized primarily by its repetitive, difficult to control quality. Subjective difficulty concentrating frequently coincides with perseverative thought and may function as both mechanism and clinical consequence of perseverative thought. Although cognitive theories suggest a bidirectional relationship between perseverative thought and difficulty concentrating, experimental and longitudinal investigations provide mixed evidence. The current study addresses this gap by testing a bidirectional relationship between momentary perseverative thought and difficulty concentrating using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) (8 surveys per day for 14 days) with 200 adult community participants (N = 155 with compliance ≥ 70%) oversampled for moderate/severe perseverative thought. Multilevel modeling tested concurrent and time-lagged associations. Difficulty concentrating and perseverative thought were concurrently and prospectively related within-person: higher difficulty concentrating at T-1 predicted higher perseverative thought at T, and higher perseverative thought at T-1 predicted higher difficulty concentrating at T (β = .19 – .20, p &lt; .001). Findings held when controlling for the outcome at T-1 (β = .02 – .06, p &lt; .001). These findings demonstrate covariation between difficulty concentrating and perseverative thought within-person in daily life consistent with theoretical models that predict bidirectional relationships. Findings suggest that intervening on difficulty concentrating and/or perseverative thought may reduce the “vicious cycle” of perseverative thought episodes.",

Using the geolocated responses of more than 1.3 million Project Implicit visitors, we found that counties characterized in the past by either sundown policies or the presence of sundown towns have higher levels of implicit and explicit racial bias today. These findings are robust across analytic choices, but generalizability and discriminant tests provided mixed evidence. This research contributes to a growing literature linking environments and biases, and demonstrates that the legacy of a shameful period in American history is not limited to the history books.",

However, the lack of an accepted definition and a cohesive theoretical corpus that allows hypothesis-based approaches, often combined with less robust empirical methods, might hinder progress in this field. To address this, we propose a definition of inter-brain synchrony and link various theoretical contributions to justify the existence of meaningful temporal alignment between different brain activities. Furthermore, we propose a set of methods aimed at minimizing bias in the collection of evidence supporting this neural mechanism. Our approach entails extracting instantaneous phase data from Hilbert-transformed EEG time series recorded from individuals under different experimental conditions that account for the synchrony’s confounding factors such as shared attention, cognitive, and motor dependencies. We then propose multiple data analysis strategies, including circular statistics combined with permutation testing, and mutual information. Finally, we present an example of a potential application within the context of cooperation in nuclear families. We believe that, by employing such methods consistently, the concept of inter brain synchrony is falsifiable. Whether this phenomenon is empirically supported or not, it will contribute to advancing our understanding of the social brain.",

Computational approaches show promise in automatically measuring social behaviors within natural settings. This study aims to automatically measure social gaze features from videos of dyadic conversations, characterize autism-related differences, and capture individual-level differences. 46 autistic Participants and 36 neurotypical Participants, aged 8-29 years, engaged in a brief video-recorded conversation with a research staff member (Partner). An automated social gaze detector was trained to detect whether each partner was looking at the other and achieved 89% cross-validated accuracy with human annotations. Comparing detailed automatic gaze measurements, autistic Participants spent less time looking at Partners and engaging in mutual gaze than neurotypical Participants did. They also initiated mutual gaze less frequently and had shorter mutual gaze episodes, but did not differ in mutual gaze counts. A social gaze summary score fusing individual variables correlated specifically with ADOS-2 Social Affect scores and not Restricted and Repetitive Behavior scores. A cross-validated multivariate classification model using gaze features was able to make individual-level diagnostic prediction (autism versus neurotypical) with 73% accuracy. This study provides a framework for automatically quantifying social gaze behaviors with high granularity and demonstrates its use in psychiatric research. This framework has a potential for enhancing measurement of social skills and tracking therapeutic progress in autism and other psychiatric conditions.",

Results indicated that these relationships were significant for all three analyzed classes of motivation: epistemic (k = 114, r = .14), existential (k = 121, r = .16), and social motivations related to the individual, relational, and collective selves (k = 100, r = .16). For all motives examined, we observed considerable heterogeneity. Moderation analyses suggest that the relationships were weaker, albeit still significant, when experimental (vs. correlational) designs were used, and differed depending on the conspiracy measure used.

          "abstract": "The striking constraints of some human cognitive processes stand in stark contrast to the near\nlimitless capability of others. While we can acquire and flexibly use vast amounts of information,\nthe amount we can process at any one time is often stiflingly limited. Here, we integrate ideas\nfrom information-theory, cognitive science, and neuroscience to offer a unified account of why\nprocessing is often so limited. We argue that this reflects a fundamental tradeoff between\nrepresentational efficiency and processing efficiency. ‘Representational efficiency’ refers to how\nmuch and how compactly information is represented by an agent, that is directly related to its\ncapacity for generalization. We distinguish this from ‘processing efficiency’, which refers to how\nmany representations can be processed at the same time. We show that maximizing\nrepresentational efficiency to optimize the capacity for generalization — a characteristically\nhuman cognitive strength — comes at the expense of surprisingly strict limits in processing\ncapacity, an equally characteristic human weakness that has been observed in a variety of\ncognitive tasks. We refer to this as the “curse of generalization,” and formulate this first in\ninformation theoretic form, and then demonstrate it in a neurally motivated model of a set of\ncanonical cognitive tasks that have been used to demonstrate the strict limits in human\nprocessing capacity. We suggest that the tension between representational efficiency and\nprocessing efficiency imposes a fundamental constraint on information processing, that may\nprovide a unified explanation for a wide range of psychological phenomena, from performance\nin the tasks on which we focus to representational learning and skill acquisition more broadly, as\nwell as the performance of modern machine learning architectures that exhibit generalization\ncapabilities comparable to humans.",

We conducted a thematic analysis of interview data using a reflexive and inductive approach. We found that children designed robots that could deliver reading-specific support alongside more general emotional support. Key functional features and capabilities included prosocial behaviours (smiling, play, conversation), breadth of knowledge that assumed access to information about many topics, including core academic skills (reading, mathematics). Key aesthetic features included colourful, compact, and customisable designs.

This quantitative study aims to characterise the role of extended relatives in caring for autistic children, and to examine the relationship between the stigma and support provided by extended relatives. Using a cross-sectional design 233 Chinese parents of autistic children were recruited by convenience and snowball sampling. The results showed that Chinese autistic children have frequent interactions with their extended relatives, with 40% living in extended family households. Extended relatives are a common source of support, and their support is considered helpful by many parents. Linear regression analysis indicated that household structure and extended relatives’ stigma towards the autistic child have a significant effect on both the frequency and helpfulness of support. Living in a nuclear or extended family household significantly moderated the effects of extended relatives’ stigma on their support. In families living apart from their extended relatives, stigma towards the autistic child and stigma towards parents were both negatively associated with the support offered by extended relatives. In contrast, when living with extended relatives, stigma towards the parent was positively associated with support, while stigma towards the autistic child was unrelated to the support provided. Our findings highlight the important role of extended relatives in the care for autistic children. Caregiver interventions should consider including extended relatives in the programme focus to address stigma and strengthen family support.",

Using survey data from 756 participants, we examined how this age group view career options, and how teaching compares to other available sectors. Teaching was recognised as a fun, people-focused career, but was seen not valued for its job security, instead being seen as underpaid with a lack of autonomy. Across all careers, participants demonstrated a fixed mindset when considering their skills. Gender, ethnicity, and school type influenced career perceptions and aspirations, highlighting the need for targeted career guidance to address misconceptions and improve careers awareness.",

          "abstract": "The N2pc is widely employed as an electrophysiological marker of an attention allocation. This interpretation was largely driven by the observation of an N2pc elicited by an isolated relevant target object, which was reported as Experiment 2 in Eimer (1996). All subsequent refined interpretations of the N2pc had to take this crucial finding into account. Despite its central role for neurocognitive attention research, there have been no direct replications and only few conceptual replications of this seminal work. Within the context of #EEGManyLabs, an international community-driven effort to replicate the most influential EEG studies ever published, the present study was selected due to its strong impact on the study of selective attention. We revisit the idea of the N2pc being an indicator of attentional selectivity by delivering a high powered direct replication of Eimer's work through analysis of 779 datasets acquired from 22 labs across 14 countries. Our results robustly replicate the N2pc to form stimuli, but a direct replication of the more influential N2pc to color stimuli technically failed. We believe that this pattern not only sheds further light on the functional significance of the N2pc as an electrophysiological marker of attentional selectivity, but also highlights a methodological problem with selecting analysis windows a priori. By contrast, the consistency of observed ERP patterns across labs and analysis pipelines is stunning and this consistency is preserved even in datasets that were rejected for (ocular) artifacts, attesting the robustness of the ERP technique and the feasibility of large-scale EEG replication studies.",

          "abstract": "We investigate how context granularity, i.e. whether fine or coarse distinctions need to be made, influences an emerging lexicon. We conduct an agent-based simulation of a concept-level reference game, in which agents learn to communicate about concepts that are operationalized by combining multiple objects. We create three experimental conditions by manipulating the context in which the instances of the target concept appear: In the fine context condition, agents must make precise distinctions between similar targets and distractors. In the coarse context condition, targets are easy to discriminate because they share no overlapping features with the distractors. In the mixed baseline condition, both fine and coarse distinctions are necessary.\nOur results suggest that agents adapt their communication strategies to the granularity of the context in which they learned the concepts. In the fine context and baseline conditions, agents develop a communication protocol heavily based on one-to-one mappings between messages and concepts. Conversely, in the coarse context condition agents communicate more efficiently by vastly relying on abstract references that may refer to more than a single concept but are unambiguous in context. These results show that ambiguity emerges in coarse contexts and that ambiguous abstract terms are used for more efficient communication.",

          "abstract": "Humans often attach notions of value to hearing the voices of specific loved ones, yet there is sparse scientific evidence supporting these claims. We present three experiments – two behavioural and one neuroimaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging: fMRI) – that tested whether personally-valued voices engage reward-motivated behaviour and associated brain responses. Using novel voice incentive delay (VID) tasks, we show that listeners respond faster in anticipation of hearing the speaking voice of their music idol than when anticipating an unfamiliar voice or a pure tone (Experiment 1). Importantly, we found a dissociation between “wanting” and “liking”, where both voices were perceived as explicitly more pleasant than a tone, but only anticipating the idol voice elicited faster reaction times. A second behavioural experiment indicated that familiarity alone was insufficient to engage stronger reward-motivated behaviour in comparison with an unfamiliar identity (Experiment 2). These behavioural patterns were further reflected in brain responses, where the idol voice most strongly engaged brain regions associated with reward processing while responses to other familiar and unfamiliar voices were often equivalent (Experiment 3). Taken together, these studies provide evidence that voices can be effective rewards, in particular when they are associated with intense parasocial interest. Future research should determine whether these findings generalise to personally known individuals.",

          "abstract": "Music training is widely claimed to enhance nonmusical abilities, yet causal evidence remains inconclusive. Moreover, research tends to focus on cognitive over socioemotional outcomes. In two studies, we investigated whether music training improves emotion recognition in voices and faces among school-aged children. We also examined music-training effects on musical abilities, motor skills (fine and gross), broader socioemotional functioning, and cognitive abilities including nonverbal reasoning, executive functions, and auditory memory (short-term and working memory). Study 1 (N = 110) was a 2-year longitudinal intervention conducted in a naturalistic school setting, comparing music training to basketball training (active control) and no training (passive control). Music training improved fine-motor skills and auditory memory relative to controls, but it had no effect on emotion recognition or other cognitive and socioemotional abilities. Both music and basketball training improved gross-motor skills. Study 2 (N = 192) compared children without music training to peers attending a music school. Although music training correlated with better emotion recognition in speech prosody (tone of voice), this association disappeared after controlling for socioeconomic status, musical abilities, or short-term memory. In contrast, musical abilities correlated with emotion recognition in both prosody and faces, independently of training or other confounding variables. These findings suggest that music training enhances fine-motor skills and auditory memory, but it does not causally improve emotion recognition. Observed advantages in emotion recognition likely stem from preexisting musical abilities and other confounding factors such as socioeconomic status.",

          "abstract": "People with autism or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) take longer to recognise emotions associated with certain facial expressions. While this effect has been sufficiently documented, its specificity received less attention. Since both conditions lead to increased reaction times on a wide variety of tasks, it is unclear whether differences in responses are specific to emotion recognition or due to attenuations of more basic sensory or motor processes. Therefore, we pair the use of a sensitive morphing task assessing emotion discrimination threshold (EDT), i.e., how much information is needed to correctly recognise an emotion, with a control task measuring species discrimination threshold (SDT). We hypothesise specific increases of EDT in adults with ADHD or autism, and differences in gaze patterns, specifically in dwell times and number of saccades. We assess our hypotheses in autistic adults with (n = 23) and without co-occurring ADHD (n = 23), adults with ADHD (n = 24) and a comparison group of typically-developing adults (n = 24). Our data supports differences in facial emotion recognition between adults with ADHD or autism and the comparison group. Furthermore, an explorative sample of adults with co-occurrence of ADHD and autism performed comparable to adults with either autism or ADHD, suggesting that a co-occurrence is not associated with additive or interactive effects. Importantly, EDT was equivalent in adults with ADHD as well as autistic adults with or without co-occurring ADHD when including SDT in the model. Moreover, there were no differences between groups in terms of gaze patterns. Similar emotion discrimination thresholds in autistic adults with and without co-occurring ADHD suggest shared mechanisms in autism and ADHD influencing facial emotion recognition. Similar gaze patterns indicate that differences in facial emotion recognition are not due to differences in attention to facial landmarks or information gathering strategies.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how people are embedded in social networks helps us navigate the social world. Yet, we learn and remember people's social attributes differently. Furthermore, it's unclear if distinct memory mechanisms for different social attributes might distort our representations of these social networks. Here, we study the relative contributions of shared contexts and personality traits when learning friendships in a social network. Specifically, we were interested in whether trait valence or specific contexts shape how humans remember friendships in social networks. Through varying levels of network topological complexity, we find the contexts where people know each other are most memorable and that better contextual retrieval uniquely relates to better recall of friendships. Moreover, subsequent computational modeling revealed that participants' biases for encoding a network member's personality traits and network position has a downstream impact on friendship recall. These results suggest contextual memory can serve as a scaffold for mapping out dyadic friendship relationships in social networks, and illustrates the acute nature by which a person's personality traits impact memory of their respective friendships. More generally, our findings give insights into how the same social network can be represented differently depending on individual learning biases and experience.",

          "abstract": "Alcohol is widely used, but motives for consumption vary. Since drinking motives are proximal predictors of initiation and escalation of alcohol use, accurate measurement of these motives is crucial. This study assessed the psychometric properties – factor structure, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability- of the 12-item, 18-item, and the original 20-item versions of the Drinking Motives Questionnaire (DMQ). We also examined the associations between drinking motives and alcohol use outcomes using network analysis. A total of 434 adults (77.4% female) completed the baseline session and 130 (85.3% female) participated in a follow-up approximately two weeks later. Results showed that the subscales of the DMQ have good internal consistency ( .80) regardless of version. Test-retest reliability was acceptable to good (rs= .71 to rs= 83) but was higher for social and enhancement than for conformity and coping motives. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the 12-item short form outperforms the original 20-item version and the more recently proposed 18-item version. Partial correlation networks including DMQ subscales and alcohol outcomes revealed consistent positive association between social motives and binge drinking, alcohol use quantity per drink occasion and enhancement motives, while frequency of use was primarily associated with coping motives. However, while associations amongst drinking motives were identical in the 12- and 18-item version, these differed from the 20-item version. This study demonstrates how network models can be valuable tools in the validation and comparison of questionnaires and shows that the 12-item DMQ could be a good alternative for the often used longer forms.",

Experiment 1 followed a normal reading paradigm, while Experiment 2 employed gaze-contingent magnification to enhance parafoveal text. We found that parafoveal magnification significantly augmented parafoveal processing, enabling word-initial letters and contextual predictability to interactively influence the prelexical activation of parafoveal targets. Our findings showed that the degree of parafoveal processing can be increased by perceptual magnification of preview information. This enhancement made orthographic information of the parafoveal target word accessible earlier, which in turn interacted with contextual factors to shape the graded activation of prelexical candidates for the target word. Our results demonstrate the utility and potential of parafoveal magnification as a novel tool for studying the temporal dynamics and attention allocation in parafoveal processing during reading.",

          "authors": "Christos Halkiopoulos",
          "abstract": "The attentional probe paradigm involves presenting participants with different messages simultaneously through two distinct information channels within the same modality. By measuring reaction times to modality-specific probes that can appear in either channel, this paradigm enables the assessment of attention allocation between these channels. Since the 1980s this paradigm has become prominent for investigating attentional biases in the processing of emotional information. The best-known version of it, the dot-probe technique introduced by MacLeod, Mathews, and Tata (1986), uses the visual modality. What is less well-known is that I had previously introduced the attentional probe paradigm in 1981 in the auditory modality in a modified dichotic listening experiment with pure tones as auditory probes. Using this tone-probe technique this study investigated the contrasting ways in which repressors and sensitisers (Byrne,1961) handle threatening information. Criticisms from a contemporary perspective notwithstanding of the rather limited initial study, it was concluded that sensitisers displayed an attentional bias favouring the processing of threatening stimuli, whereas repressors appeared to avoid the optimal processing of such stimuli.  This paper presents a historical reconstruction of how I developed the attentional probe paradigm, how I first applied it in the auditory modality, and how it was subsequently used in the visual modality. It also introduces a multimodal version to be used in further research and offers a critique of extant research relying exclusively on decontextualized stimuli.",

In emergent communication, two artificial neural network agents develop a language while solving a communicative task. In this study, the agents play a concept-level reference game. This means that the speaker agent has to describe a concept to a listener agent, who has to pick the correct target objects that satisfy the concept. Concepts consist of multiple objects and can be either more specific, i.e. the target objects share many attributes, or more generic, i.e. the target objects share fewer attributes. We test two directions of zero-shot generalization to novel levels of abstraction: When generalizing from more generic to very specific concepts, agents utilize a compositional strategy. When generalizing from more specific to very generic concepts, agents utilize a more flexible linguistic strategy that involves reusing many messages from training. Our results provide evidence that neural network agents can learn robust concepts based on which they can generalize using adaptive linguistic strategies. We discuss how this research provides new hypotheses on abstraction and informs linguistic theories on efficient communication.",

A parallel dissociation in humans would have clear clinical implications.  Here, we investigated whether dimensions of depressed and anxious affect do indeed differentially impact effortful reward pursuit versus threat avoidance in humans. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling revealed that component decision-making mechanisms underlying effortful reward pursuit were differentially impacted by latent dimensions capturing the depressive symptoms of apathy versus anhedonia.

We replicated this test across two distinct moral dimensions: harm to innocent people and contamination of nature’s purity. Our findings show that all message versions had strong immediate persuasive effects relative to a control condition, and much of those effects remained after a three-week period. However, there were no clear advantages—in immediate effects or in durability—from adding explicit moral claims to the messages.",

          "abstract": "Unemployed people bear a stigma that builds on the stereotype of \"the unemployed\" and is associated with many adverse outcomes. No study has used the dimensions and facets of the latest integrated stereotype framework to describe their stereotype and compare it with other groups. In Study 1 among university students (n = 241), we show that unemployed people are rated lower than employed people on the horizontal and the vertical dimensions of their stereotypes, as well as on the facets of capacity, assertiveness, morality and friendliness. We show that unemployed people are also rated the lowest when compared to a high-high occupation (firefighters) and a low-low occupation (railroad workers). In Study 2, we replicate these findings with university students (n = 193) and show that unemployed people are also blatantly dehumanized when compared to the same targets. In Study 3, we show that vocational integration workers (n = 123) also rate unemployed people lower than employed people on both dimensions and facets, but not on morality. Overall, we conclude that unemployed people have a highly destructive stereotype that is lacking in every dimension and facet, and that they are overly despised.",

          "abstract": "How do people come up with funny ideas? Profanity—the language’s rich panoply of obscenity, vulgarity, and indecency—is a ubiquitous comedic device deployed in creative humor. The present research explored variation in profanity use when generating jokes. A sample of adults (n = 618) completed a creative humor production task, and text-mining methods detected and coded the appearance and severity of profanity. Random forest models were used to identify potentially important predictors, such as variables relevant to profanity generally (e.g., age, gender, and personality traits) and variables specific to humor creation (e.g., humor self-concepts and self-ratings of their jokes’ funniness). Profanity in the jokes was reasonably common, used by 22% of the sample, diverse in type, and generally mild in severity. The random forest models identified a set of uniquely important predictors. Profanity use and severity were marked by being younger, identifying as male, rating one’s own jokes as funny, and expressing more confidence in one’s ability to be funny and make others laugh—a true profile in boorishness. The discussion explores roles for personality in indecorous humor and the broader question of strategic aspects of humor creation.",

Methods: Separating within-person effects from between-person effects, a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) was applied to three annual waves of data (T1, T2, T3) on social media use, gaming and internalising symptoms among N=25,629 adolescents (51% girls, average age 12 years, 7 months (SD = 3.58 months) at baseline) in Greater Manchester, England. Results: Longitudinal relationships varied by gender, such that more frequent gaming at T2 predicted less time spent on social media use at T3 in girls (but not boys) and, more frequent internalising symptoms at T2 predicted reductions in gaming frequency at T3 in boys (but not girls). There was no evidence that time spent on social media or gaming frequency predicted later internalising symptoms among girls or boys. Sensitivity analyses which distinguished active versus passive social media use replicated these findings. Conclusions: The findings of this study do not support the widely held view that adolescent technology use is a major causal factor in their mental health difficulties.",

FBB includes weekly SEL classroom sessions, activities on the football pitch, 1:1 therapy sessions, holiday support, and rewards trips.  Method: Propensity score matching and difference-in-differences estimation were used in a pre-test/post-test control group design to assess the impact of FBB on the mental wellbeing (assessed via the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, SWEMWBS) of participants designated at-risk (N=46 aged 12-14, 81.6% boys), passive learners (N=72, aged 12-14, 84.7% boys), and role models (N=35, aged 12-14, 85.7% boys), with matched control samples derived from a subset of the #BeeWell cohort study (N=8,015). Results: A significant intervention effect was observed for at-risk youth, with FBB leading to an increase of approximately 2.4 SWEMWBS points (d = 0.44).  No intervention effects were observed for passive learners or role models. Conclusions: Preliminary evidence indicates that FBB can improve mental wellbeing of at-risk youth.

Framing norms as dynamic (changing over time) rather than static (fixed in the present) can encourage individuals to adopt counter-normative behaviors and attitudes. We investigated whether dynamic norm interventions reduce ideological polarization (divergence in policy attitudes between groups) and affective polarization (hostility toward opposing parties). In a pilot study (N = 50), we identified credible dynamic bipartisan norms (e.g., increasing bipartisan support for poverty assistance). In Study 1 (N = 389), Democrats and Republicans underestimated in-party and out-party support for these norms and misperceived trends, believing Republican support had declined when it had actually grown. In Study 2 (N = 1,187), exposure to dynamic bipartisan norms reduced ideological polarization but did not significantly reduce affective polarization, suggesting that shifting policy attitudes does not necessarily foster cross-party goodwill.

          "abstract": "The 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar has been criticised for numerous social, political, and environmental issues. While an important call to boycott the tournament spread worldwide, research has yet to document the motives underlying a boycott of such a mega sporting event. We investigated fans’ intentions to boycott the 2022 FIFA World Cup in four countries of the Francophonie engaged in the World Cup (N = 1,635). We found that being highly identified with the team and enjoying football for aesthetic pleasures predicted rejection of the boycott, while the most robust predictor of boycott intentions was a concern for environmental issues. When assessing actual boycott behaviours among fans after the World Cup (N = 286), we found a significant decrease compared to boycott intentions. Importantly, this intention–behaviour gap was true even for politicised fans with high awareness of social and environmental issues who initially planned to boycott the tournament. We discuss the paradox of calls to boycott mega sporting events: Unlike other consumption products, these events often have no alternatives, which influences fans’ decisions not to boycott. As a consequence, boycott behaviours mirror one’s fandom rather than political values, and boycotters are those barely interested in these events in any case.",

(1) reported that so-called ‘problem gambling,’ as they defined it, is associated with monetary spending on video game mechanics that involve randomisation (e.g., gacha mechanics (2,3) and loot boxes (4)) amongst young Hong Kong players of games containing such mechanics. At face value, that assertion is not surprising as a consistent line of research has previously established that relationship in Western countries (5–7), which has been relied upon in policymaking (8,9). Research conducted subsequent to Tang et al. in Mainland China has also replicated the relationship (10).\n\nHowever, unfortunately, Tang et al. suffered from a fundamental flaw. That study did not, in fact, measure ‘problem gambling’ as traditionally defined because Tang et al. significantly modified the measurement scale. Instead, Tang et al. measured only ‘problematic participation in gacha mechanics’ and proved various relationships existed between that construct and other variables, which arguably is less meaningful (11,12). The development of that new scale lacked transparency and evidence of reliability and validity. It is unclear whether that new measure is related to ‘problem gambling’ and, if so, to what extent. In any case, it is not, and cannot be used as, a direct replacement without further validation\n\nTang et al. could not in fact have been able to report on any issues concerning ‘problem gambling’ because by definition, they did not measure ‘problem gambling.’ They should not have claimed to have been able to test or comment on any psychological relationships concerning ‘problem gambling.’ The current framing of that paper and its conclusions are misleading to readers whose attention are not specifically drawn to this highly significant measurement modification. This comment intends to correct that misimpression. Simply put, Tang et al. did not prove what its title suggested.

In two pre-registered studies, we tested whether negative affect increases approach bias and craving for chocolate and alcohol, with strongest effects expected in individuals with self-reported emotional intake.\nMethods: In Study 1 (N = 87), negative or neutral affect was induced on separate days, followed by an approach-avoidance-task and craving ratings. Study 2 used a more potent affect induction, included a larger sample, and nested affect induction sessions within a single day (N = 132). \nResults: In Study 1, affect was unsuccessfully induced, so we analysed the effect of self-reported sadness. Approach biases and cravings to chocolate and alcohol were stronger during sessions with higher self-reported sadness. Study 2 replicated and extended this finding by showing that also induced negative affect increased biases and cravings. Further, emotional eaters showed a stronger affect-related increase in chocolate bias, while emotional drinkers exhibited consistently stronger biases independent of affect. \nConclusion: Craving and approach bias increases may explain self-regulation failures during negative affect. While these mechanisms were similar for both appetitive substances, affect-related increases in approach bias may be especially relevant in emotional eating but not in emotional drinking.",

In this paper we (1) conducted an exploratory cluster analysis on their textual justifications of their moral responsibility ratings using word-embeddings and (2) investigated the correlation between moral responsibility ratings and the proportion of words participants use from each cluster. We found that participants who used more words from the “event detection” cluster were more likely to attribute higher moral responsibility to the humanoid robot. Conversely, those who used more words from the “mechanistic properties” cluster tended to attribute less moral responsibility to the humanoid robot.

Two pre-registered experiments (Study 1: N = 461; Study 2: N = 444) found that, for the same hotel review, third-party reviewers were perceived more favorably than self-reviewers (i.e., hotel managers), leading to more positive evaluations of the hotel. Reviews attributed to AI writers negatively impacted impressions of the reviewer and diminished the review’s impact, with third-party reviewers more negatively affected by AI writer labels than self-reviewers. AI labels of user-generated content can therefore move people out of their default impression formation state. We demonstrate theoretical advancements for warranting theory and AIMC.",

          "abstract": "*This is a preprint and has been accepted for publication by Cognitive Development* Children’s metacognitive monitoring is typically considered as a domain general skill that can be applied in different tasks and situations. However, this assumption lacks empirical evidence as few studies tested whether children’s accuracy of monitoring judgments as well as their monitoring behaviours are consistent across tasks. It is also not clear if children who provide more accurate monitoring judgments also show more frequent monitoring behaviours. In the current research study 53 elementary school children’s metacognitive monitoring was assessed with four tasks: on the one hand, the accuracy of children’s monitoring judgments was assessed with two computer-based tasks (one task required monitoring of memory and the other task required monitoring of reaction times); on the other hand, the frequency with which they engaged in monitoring behaviours was assessed with two construction tasks. Correlational analysis showed that there was no significant association between children’s monitoring judgment accuracies. In turn, children’s monitoring behaviour on two construction tasks was significantly positively associated. Intercorrelations between children’s monitoring judgment accuracies and monitoring behaviours showed that children who more accurately monitored their reaction time showed significantly more monitoring behaviour when working on construction tasks. Conversely, children’s monitoring judgment accuracy on a memory task was not associated with their monitoring behaviour. These findings suggest that the processes underlying children’s monitoring judgments may be task specific, whereas their tendency to engage in monitoring behaviours may be domain general. Implications for promoting metacognitive monitoring are discussed.",

However, participants might perceive the repetitive self-reporting in these data collection techniques as burdensome and demotivating, resulting in decreased compliance rates. In this tutorial paper, we present a user-centered approach aimed at making participation in experience sampling and daily diary studies a meaningful and fun experience for adolescents. Methods. In three major research projects that took place between 2019 – 2023, more than 4,000 Dutch adolescents participated (12 - 25 years old). To improve the participants’ user journey, adolescents were invited to co-design our studies and share their expertise in interviews (n = 459), focus groups (n = 101), design decisions (i.e., A/B tests, n = 107), pilots (n = 163), exit interviews (n = 167), and by answering user experience questionnaires (n = 2,109). Results. Across projects, we discovered five different main intrinsic and extrinsic motives to participate in intensive longitudinal studies: (1) rewards, (2) fun and interest, (3) helping science or the greater good, (4) helping the scientist or another person, and (5) gaining self-insight. We provide concrete examples of how we tailored our study designs to address these specific motives to optimize youth engagement. Conclusions. The engagement of adolescents in intensive longitudinal studies can be enhanced by making it a meaningful and enjoyable experience, aligned with their own motives.",

          "authors": "Matteo Perini; Jasper de Groot",
          "abstract": "The fashion industry is a major environmental polluter, and behavioral scientists can investigate strategies to reduce obstacles to second-hand sustainable solutions. We propose an evolutionary framework rooted in the Parasite-Stress Theory of Values as a comprehensive explanation for the cultural, individual, and situational differences in second-hand clothing, postulating that second-hand clothing triggers evolved pathogen-avoidance mechanisms that form a barrier to second-hand purchases. This barrier can be mitigated by hygiene-related sensory cues, like a clean-laundry odor. In a field study (N = 257), we counterbalanced three odor conditions (clean-laundry, citrus, and regular store odor), and found that clean-laundry scent significantly boosted purchasing behavior by overriding the negative effect of germ-aversion. Indeed, among store’s customers, higher levels of pathogen avoidance resulted in less spending and more negative attitudes toward second-hand clothing. Further support for our mechanistic model is provided by the lab pilot study—where clean-laundry scent was shown to significantly reduce pathogen concerns, while enhancing garments’ perceived value and appeal—and by experimentally increasing pathogen saliency in survey responders, resulting in more negative second-hand clothing attitudes. This research highlights the critical role of pathogen avoidance mechanisms and cleanliness cues in overcoming psychological barriers to effectively promote sustainable consumer practices.",

          "abstract": "ICT literacy encompasses a range of cognitive abilities that facilitate the effective use of digital technologies. Two studies on German students investigated the role of reading comprehension and mathematical competencies in the development of ICT literacy in adolescence. A variance decomposition analysis (N = 13,335) revealed that both competence domains together accounted for nearly half of the explained item variances in two ICT literacy assessments. Additionally, a cross-lagged panel analysis (N = 4,872) demonstrated that reading and mathematical competencies predicted ICT literacy growth over three years, while ICT literacy also had reciprocal effects on domain-specific competencies. These findings emphasize that ICT literacy is not merely a technical skill set but is also closely related to other cognitive abilities.",

          "abstract": "Fluency theory assumes that perceived truth is influenced by the subjective ease with which presented information is processed. Several studies have demonstrated that increased perceptual fluency, induced by high versus low color contrast of presented statements, results in higher truth judgments. According to the discrepancy-attribution hypothesis, the unexpected switch from several low-fluency stimuli to a high-fluency stimulus is assumed to enhance perceived truthfulness. In two online studies (one preregistered), we aimed to replicate the central finding by Hansen, Dechêne, and Wänke (2008; Journal of Experimental Social Psychology) that discrepancies in color contrast influence truth judgments. Additionally, we extended the original design by varying the length of stimulus blocks presented in low or high color contrast. Contrary to previous findings, neither the level of perceptual fluency nor unexpected discrepancies in fluency affected truth judgments even though high-contrast statements were read faster than low-contrast ones, indicating that processing fluency was successfully manipulated. A meta-analysis combining our two experiments with published studies shows that the effect of perceptual fluency induced by color contrast on truth judgments may not be as robust as previously thought.",

          "title": "The reliability of bilateral cerebral laterality for word generation: who is left in the middle?",
          "authors": "Robin Gerrits",
          "abstract": "Although word production is considered a strongly left hemispheric lateralized function, its cerebral asymmetry varies among individuals. The most popular way of determining hemisphere dominance is to calculate a laterality index (LI) by comparing brain activity between the two hemispheres. Large LIs can readily be classified as left or right dominant, but there is no consensus on how to treat bilateral LIs indicating (near) symmetrical activity. The problem with interpreting very small LIs is perpetuated by a lack of reliability, stemming from the challenge of systematically investigating these uncommon cases \n(usually ≤ 10% of a sample). To address this gap, we performed two studies that investigated the reliability and across-methods generalizability of bilateral LIs obtained from functional transcranial Doppler sonography (fTCDS), an ultrasound-based approach that measures cerebral blood flow velocity. In Study 1, we compared reproducibility of bilateral LIs (n=35) and clearly lateralized LIs (n=32) during a letter verbal fluency fTCDS task across two sessions. While left-lateralized classifications were highly replicable (97% reproduced), poorer reproducibility was observed for bilateral classifications (51% reproduced). In fact, dichotomous left-right categorization yielded more reliable outcomes than assigning participants with bilateral LIs to a separate category (80% reproduced). Study 2 assessed whether small fTCDS asymmetry extended to other instruments for determining cerebral laterality (visual half field method and fMRI). Participants consistently classified as bilateral by fTCDS (n=18) also exhibited reduced group-level asymmetry in these other methods. Based on these results, we suggest that LIs reflect a combination of idiosyncratic cerebral asymmetry, state-dependent fluctuations, and measurement noise. Our findings also indicate that a subset of the population has a neural system for word production that is inherently weakly lateralized, although true hemispheric equivalence is likely extremely rare. Finally, we offer recommendations for classifying asymmetry in clinical and research contexts.",

          "authors": "Alain de Cheveigné",
          "abstract": "It is common in behavioural sciences to require subjects of an experiment to sign an informed consent form. The form explains the procedures and risks, and the signature certifies that the subject is aware and consents. The motivation for this requirement – protection of the subject – is noble and uncontroversial, but the implications do not all align with that motivation. I argue that the subject's signature is often unnecessary. Signature commits – rather than protects – the subject, and produces a trace with sensitive personal information that prevents full anonymization and puts a burden on the investigator and institution to protect and curate that information. Trust based on shared norms is replaced by a contract that has to cover every eventuality and thus may be hard to understand. Those downsides are absent when a signature is not gathered. Signed consent might protect the investigator or institution, but that is distinct from protecting the subject. The decision to gather a signature should be justified to the IRB by the investigator, rather than the decision to not gather it. A well-designed informed consent form, unsigned, can protect both subject and investigator.",

          "abstract": "Recent developments suggest that Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising approach for approximating empirical correlation matrices of item responses by utilizing item embeddings and their cosine similarities. In this paper, we introduce a novel tool, which we label SEMbeddings. This tool integrates mpnet-personality (a fine-tuned embedding model) with latent measurement models to assess model fit or misfit prior to data collection. To support our statement, we apply SEMbeddings to the 96 items of the VIA-IS-P, which measures 24 different character strengths, using responses from 31,697 participants. Our analysis shows a significant, though not perfect, correlation (r = .67) between the cosine similarities of embeddings and empirical correlations among items. We then demonstrate how to fit confirmatory factor analyses on the cosine similarity matrices produced by mpnet-personality and interpret the outcomes using modification indices. We found that relying on traditional fit indices when using SEMbeddings can be misleading as they often lead to more conservative conclusions compared to empirical results. Nevertheless, they provide valuable suggestions about possible misfit, and we argue that the modification indices obtained from these models could serve as a useful screening tool to make informed decisions about items prior to data collection. As LLMs become increasingly precise and new fine-tuned models are released, these procedures have the potential to deliver more reliable results, potentially transforming the way new questionnaires are developed.",

          "authors": "Timo Kvamme; Merlin Monzel; Yoko Nagai; Juha Silvanto",
          "abstract": "Aphantasia, characterized by absent or reduced visual mental imagery, has been associated with alexithymia and negative mental health outcomes. However, the underlying mechanisms driving these associations remain unclear. Since mental health is closely linked to interoception, we examined whether interoceptive processing plays a role in these relationships, assessing self-reported imagery vividness (VVIQ), subjective interoceptive accuracy and attention, alexithymia, and mental health, including anxiety and depression, in individuals with (n = 153, VVIQ = 16–32) and without aphantasia (n = 680, VVIQ = 33–80). The results revealed distinct patterns between these groups. In the aphantasia group, higher VVIQ was associated with greater alexithymia and poorer mental health outcomes, suggesting that individuals with weak imagery (hypophantasia) exhibited more emotional difficulties than those with almost no imagery (core aphantasia). In contrast, in the non-aphantasia group, VVIQ correlated negatively with alexithymia and positively with mental health, aligning with previous research indicating a protective role of vivid imagery. Structural equation modelling confirmed that alexithymia strongly mediated the link between VVIQ and negative mental health outcomes in both groups, reinforcing alexithymia as a mediator between imagery ability and well-being. Another key factor in these relationships was the ratio between subjective interoceptive accuracy and attention, which mediated the relationship between VVIQ and alexithymia and mental health outcomes. These findings highlight the heterogeneity within aphantasia, distinguishing hypophantasia from core aphantasia and revealing distinct interoceptive and mental health profiles.",

          "abstract": "Future Work Self salience (FWSS) refers to how vividly individuals envision their future selves in their careers, representing personally relevant hopes and aspirations related to work (Strauss et al., 2012). Research on FWSS has expanded rapidly in the last decade, but the findings have not yet been quantitatively synthesized. We present meta-analytic insight of relationships between FWSS and various antecedents and outcomes derived from the Career Construction Model of Adaptation (CCMA) based on K = 74 studies, k = 80 independent samples, and N = 27,643 individuals. FWSS is strongly associated with the adaptivity constructs proactive personality and psychological capital (both rc = .43). Additionally, it is is moderately related to supports (rc = .37). FWSS is strongly related with career adaptability (rc = .56) and adapting responses, including proactive career behaviors (rc = .46), proactive work behaviors (rc = .44), career decision self-efficacy (rc = .45), and occupational self-efficacy (rc = .48). Regarding adaptation results, FWSS is moderately related to employability (rc = .31) and occupational well-being (rc = .26), while showing a strong relationship with general well-being (rc = .39) and meaning in life (rc = .54). FWSS is also strongly associated with work engagement (rc = .39). The relative weights analysis confirms the distinct relationship between FWSS and PCBs. Additionally, the mediation analysis indicates that career adaptability acts as a mediator between FWSS and PCBs, offering deeper insights into the role of FWSS within the CCMA. Finally, demographic and contextual variables, such as age and cultural individualism, influence some of the examined relationships. The meta-analysis contributes to a refinement of the CCMA and future research on the role of FWSS in career development.",

We found that confidence ratings were systematically attracted to those in preceding trials (similar to “confidence leak”), even with matched performance. We further found that CSD required explicit confidence judgments in preceding decisions and was largely independent of preceding motor response patterns. By comparing a factorial combination of computational models, we found that CSD arises from the jittering of a fixed decision criterion template based on past information instead of from dynamically updating criteria across trials. As our study focuses on decisions on a lab-based visual motion task, our model needs to be tested against data from other tasks and scenarios. Our results suggest that our metacognition adapts in response to recent perceptual decisions.",

          "abstract": "Alcohol consumption can pose health risks and cause social problems, hence harmful drinking is a global health concern. Acculturation has been theorized and examined as a key driver for drinking behaviors. In this State of the Science article, we define sociocultural and psychological acculturation, and describe three causal theories associated with socialization and learning, stress and coping, and accessibility and opportunity. Data have shown small-to-moderate associations linking acculturation factors to drinking outcomes. Many existing studies measure acculturation with demographic proxies and static cultural orientation indicators. Underlying causal mechanisms are typically inferred rather than tested directly, with limited focus on key proximal factors such as stress responses, drinking motives, and cultural norms. Furthermore, current alcohol interventions lack alignment with acculturation science and fail to target modifiable, drinking-related factors. To advance the field and bridge research-to-practice gaps, studies should move beyond broad demographic markers and examine systematically the psychological and social pathways linking acculturation to alcohol use. We advocate for the adoption of context-specific measures, daily life study methods to capture acculturation’s dynamic effects on drinking, and research across diverse global populations. We call for the field to integrate the acculturation framework into broader alcohol research and interventions to address individual and cultural variations in drinking behaviors, incorporate sociocultural influences into existing models of alcohol use to bridge gaps in generalizability, and enhance intervention effectiveness.",

Study 1 first established a correlation between how much people naturally simulated an option for an upcoming personal decision over one week and the likelihood that they would choose that option. Studies 2a and 2b demonstrated that simulation caused a small but significant increase in the likelihood a person would choose the simulated option for their personal decision relative to a non-simulated option. Finally, Studies 3, 4a, and 4b, revealed that simulation shapes decisions in controlled laboratory experiments where options were matched on initial preference. This work suggests that episodic simulation may contribute to a feedback loop, reinforcing preferences by making people more likely to choose options they simulate.",

Two pre-registered experiments (Study 1: N = 461; Study 2: N = 444) found that, for the same hotel review, third-party reviewers were perceived more favorably than self-reviewers (i.e., hotel managers), leading to more positive evaluations of the hotel. Reviews attributed to AI writers negatively impacted impressions of the reviewer and diminished the review’s impact, with third-party reviewers more negatively affected by AI writer labels than self-reviewers. AI labels of user-generated content can therefore move people out of their default impression formation state. We demonstrate theoretical advancements for warranting theory and AIMC.",

          "abstract": "Models like the drift diffusion model have been highly influential in explaining decision-making as a tug-of-war process, where evidence for competing options accumulates until a threshold is reached. While these models capture several key aspects of decision-making, they have difficulty accounting for others, including the influence of individual option values on choice speed and the subjective cost of choosing, as well as the fact that that choice competition is itself malleable. This chapter argues for a broader framework that moves beyond a strict tug-of-war approach, by incorporating both independent and competitive evidence accumulation. We show that adopting this alternate framework not only better accounts for the evaluative processes underlying choice (e.g., which option is best), but also how the same evaluations can be applied towards decisions about how good one’s options are on the whole; whether and when to make a choice; and how many options to choose.",

This preregistered systematic review and meta-analysis examines studies that measured depressive symptoms and alterations in belief updating, in both updating-to-positive and updating-to-negative information directions. \n\nMethod\nThe PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library electronic databases were searched for studies examining belief updating and depressive symptomatology, resulting in retrieval of 33 papers (N = 3431 individuals). Risk of bias was assessed using an adapted version of the Downs and Black checklist and risk for publication bias was assessed visually with funnel plots, as well as statistically with Egger’s test and Duval and Tweedie’s trim-and-fill procedure. Random effects models were used for calculating pooled effect sizes.\n\nResults\nWe found evidence for a small, significant association (r = -0.11) between depressive symptoms and deficits in updating-to-positive information, but not for updating-to-negative information. Heterogeneity in both models was low. Exploratory subgroup analyses pointed to significant differences in the updating-to-positive direction based on the paradigm used, but this was not significant in the updating-to-negative direction. There were few concerns regarding the risk of bias and no evidence suggesting publication bias. \n\nConclusions\nDepression is linked to a specific deficit in updating beliefs in response to positive, disconfirming information, whereas no association was found with updating beliefs in response to negative information.",

          "abstract": "Background: Residual cognitive complaints are frequently observed in remitted depressed individuals (RMD), which can impair full recovery and increase the likelihood of recurrent episodes of depression. Cognitive control training has shown potential as a preventative intervention in RMD with small to moderate effect sizes, but substantial heterogeneity in effects between individuals exists.\n\nObjective: This study aimed to identify individual characteristics associated with treatment response to CCT in RMD participants using machine learning models.\n\nMethods: A sample of 227 RMD participants underwent a CCT regimen of at least 10 sessions. Three machine-learning models were evaluated: logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost, alongside one random classifier benchmark. Performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC were computed. The importance of individual features in predicting preventative effects was assessed using SHAP values.\n\nResult: All models demonstrated low performance, despite different machine learning methodologies and robust analyses. The random forest model scored the highest performance, although this was still considered low (accuracy: 0.52; AUC-ROC: 0.46). Exploratory feature importance analysis revealed that age, sense of well-being, and life satisfaction were important variables in the models, while current use of psychotherapy, number of prior depressive episodes, and a history of inpatient treatment were not.\n\nConclusion: All models performed poorly, indicating that baseline characteristics did not confidently predict CCT preventative effects in this RMD sample. Exploratory feature analysis proposed some variables that increase the likelihood of benefiting from CCT, as well as  indicated that most demographical variables did not strongly affect treatment effects, suggesting that CCT may be suitable for a broad range of RMD individuals.",

The present study aimed to address previous limitations (low statistical power, lack of preregistration) and investigate the predictability of intelligence measures from resting-state EEG in the CoScience data set (N = 772). Support vector regressions were applied to analyze eight minutes of resting-state EEG with eyes open and closed before and after unrelated tasks. The decoding performance between the spectral power of 59 EEG channels within 30 frequency bins and fluid and crystallized intelligence, was evaluated with a 10-fold cross-validation. We could not identify any meaningful associations between resting-state EEG spectral power and either fluid or crystallized intelligence. However, we replicated the previously reported association between state sleepiness and theta power, attesting to the integrity of the CoScience data set. Furthermore, the decomposition of the EEG signal into its periodic and aperiodic components revealed that the aperiodic offset parameter is significantly correlated with state sleepiness, emphasizing the relevance of aperiodic signal components in understanding states of alertness versus sleepiness.",

They capture so-called ‘direct’ genetic effects that are independent of environmental confounding, but also ‘indirect’ genetic effects due to gene-environment correlations, assortative mating, and population stratification. Indirect genetic effects complicate the interpretation and application of PGS predictions.  Here, we systematically charted the variability of PGS predictions in N=8,115 dizygotic twins from UK, US, Swedish, and German samples aged 7 to 19 years. \n\nPopulation-level PGS predictions of educational achievement ranged from beta =.16 to .37 across ages and countries. Indirect genetic effects due to environmental confounding accounted for 10% to 65% of the population-level PGS predictions, with family socioeconomic status explaining 29-100% of these indirect genetic effects. Variability in direct and indirect genetic effects was largely unsystematic across countries’ school systems (multi-tiered vs. comprehensive) and children’s ages. Therefore, interpretations of indirect genetic effects on educational achievement remain, at present, speculative.",

          "abstract": "Background: Conduct problems trajectory studies suggest their development is highly heterogeneous and that different trajectories may be uniquely associated with different risk factors and outcomes. Yet studies combining trajectory modelling and a varied set of genetic and early-life risk factors, as well as adult outcomes, are scarce. \n\nMethods: We analysed data from the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS), a longitudinal UK twin cohort (N=18,993). Conduct problems were measured using parent reports of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) conduct problems subscale at four time points between ages 4 and 12. Trajectories were identified using growth mixture modelling. We then explored associations between trajectory class membership and genetic and early-life factors (age 4), and adult life and clinical outcomes (age 26). \n\nResults: Four conduct problem trajectories were identified: Low Stable (n=15,304, 81%), Childhood-Limited (n= 1,395, 7%), Childhood-Increasing (n=1,791, 9%) and Persistent (n=503, 3%). Associations with risk factors followed a stepped pattern with individuals in the Persistent class reporting higher genetic liability and early-life risk. Higher genetic vulnerability to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder distinguished between the Low Stable and all other classes. Higher externalising problems polygenic score, negative family environment and hyperactivity/inattention, distinguished between all classes, except the Childhood-Increasing and the Childhood-Decreasing ones. Children experiencing conduct problems in childhood were at higher risk for reporting poorer current and lifetime mental and physical health outcomes, lower educational attainment and financial difficulties.\n\nConclusions: Children experiencing conduct problems face multiple risk factors that should be addressed. Previously identified risk factors (i.e. negative family environment, hyperactivity/inattention), continued to differentiate between all classes after accounting for various psychiatric polygenic scores, validating existing interventions targeting these factors. Childhood conduct problems were associated with poor outcomes in adulthood, emphasising the need to develop interventions identifying those at risk early.",

          "abstract": "Associative memory naturally declines with age. However, when associative memory is supported by semantic knowledge, older adults can compensate for this decline. This study aims to explore the use of the method of loci, which involves associating each item of a to-be-memorized list with a location along a familiar route, that we adapted to leverage pre-existing knowledge in semantic memory. The memory of young (18–30 years old) and older (60–75 years old) participants was tested after encoding word lists using the method of loci under two conditions: congruent or incongruent with pre-existing knowledge, compared to a control condition. The objective was to assess memory performance improvement based on encoding conditions and age groups. The results showed significant memory performance improvements in both groups when the method of loci was used with congruent associations. In contrast, performance in the incongruent condition was similar to that observed during encoding without a specific strategy, highlighting the importance of semantic links for associative memory.  Furthermore, using the method of loci with congruent associations, older adults displayed recall performance equivalent to young adults, while it was not the case with incongruent associations. The method of loci applied in conditions of semantic congruence thus appears to be a promising compensatory strategy for older adults.",

          "abstract": "So far, we have used stochastic differential equations to explain the process that leads to feelings and thoughts that assume a Wiener process. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is feeling at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of a group of curves, such as the person's similarity curve, is at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. This cannot be explained by the conventional concept of similarity curves and other curve groups using the Wiener process. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using exponential distribution (exponential process) and Poisson process. We derived the stochastic differential equation given for the time when the person is not depressed, and showed that the time when the person is not depressed is an exponential distribution (exponential process). We also derived an exponential distribution (exponential process) for the number of times a person becomes depressed during a certain period of time, and showed that the number of times a person becomes depressed during a certain period of time is a Poisson process. Based on these results, we explained the relationship between the number of times a person becomes depressed during a certain period of time and the time when he or she is not depressed. We also discussed the connection with similarity curve and other results in the previously discussed paper. Finally, he stated that placing oneself in an environment or state where one is less likely to become depressed is a way to cope with depression.",

Yet, differential diagnosis is challenging and limited to clinical interviews and self-report symptom questionnaires. We predicted that obsessions and paranoia would be associated with distinct patterns of behavior in our well-established probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) task. Probabilistic reversal learning involves updating beliefs about rewards when contingencies change. Obsessions and paranoia have been linked to excessive switching behaviors during reversal learning, although some report perseveration in patients with OCD and those with schizophrenia. Here, we analyze data gathered from the general population to assess the associations between obsessions, paranoia, and PRL task performance. Using a novel computational method – Bayesian Gaussian Graphical Modeling combined with a Hierarchical Gaussian Filter – we distinguish the impacts of paranoia and obsession on reversal learning – despite their significant correlation. We find that win-switching arises in paranoia from deficits in learning about uncertainty in the global task structure, whereas excessive switching in OCD arises from challenges in learning about uncertainty at the local choice level.",

          "abstract": "The rapid growth of psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) research and considerable debate around PAT’s promise and limitations as a healthcare intervention demand addressing theoretical gaps in PAT development. Traditional clinical trials evaluate PAT as a simple pharmaceutical treatment, overlooking its inherent complexity as a multi-component intervention. This position piece advocates for applying the UK Medical Research Council’s complex intervention framework to PAT, emphasising: theory of therapeutic change, structured development phases, contextual interactions, and stakeholder inclusion. The limitations of standard explanatory clinical trials, particularly their challenges with real-world validity, are contrasted with pragmatic clinical trial designs. Pragmatic randomised controlled trials (RCTs), informed by the PRECIS-2 tool, provide a pathway to align PAT clinical trial designs with real-world applications. This approach enables the exploration of how PAT interacts with existing healthcare systems potentially optimising its therapeutic utility in the intended patient population.  Furthermore, we discuss the philosophical divergence between perspectives on PAT’s efficacy, contrasting drug-centric views with psychotherapy-augmented theories and how this should influence PAT trial design. We propose the integration of qualitative data, adaptive designs, and comparative effectiveness research to refine PAT interventions and address the shortcomings of conventional double-blind RCTs. By leveraging academic and community-led research, this work proposes a pluralistic evidentiary model, enabling more inclusive, practical trial designs that might be considered in expanded evidence assessments. This approach holds the promise of advancing psychedelic medicine while avoiding the historical pitfalls that limited its development in prior decades.",

This screener, designed for rapid administration without clinical supervision, effectively differentiates between cognitively normal individuals and those at risk of progression along the Alzheimer’s disease continuum. Validation analyses demonstrate that the screener has high sensitivity and specificity, outperforming many conventional assessments while promising to significantly reduce the burden on clinicians. By offering a brief, accessible, and reliable alternative to standard screening tools, this approach has the potential to enhance early detection efforts and facilitate timely intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare resources.",

This study’s purpose was to describe the Conners Kiddie Continuous Performance Test (K-CPT) assessment in children born VPT, including rates of clinically elevated scores, intra-individual change over time, and associations between K-CPT scores and parent reported attention problems.\nMethods: We studied 305 children from a multi-site study of children born VPT who completed at least one K-CPT assessment at age 5, 6, and/or 7 years. Parent-reported ADHD symptoms and diagnosis were also collected. We calculated K-CPT completion rates, mean scores, and rates of clinically elevated scores at each timepoint. Linear mixed models examined change over time in K-CPT scores. Correlations and generalized linear models investigated associations between K-CPT scores and ADHD symptoms and diagnoses.\nResults: K-CPT scores showed expected age-related improvements from age 5 to 7, with significant intra-individual variability. Up to 1/3 of children had clinically elevated attention problems and another 1/3 had subclinical elevations. K-CPT scores were modestly correlated with parent-rated ADHD symptoms and children with a parent-reported ADHD diagnosis performed worse on nearly all K-CPT metrics.\nConclusion: Performance-based measures like the K-CPT can be useful for research and clinical practice in VPT populations.",

          "abstract": "In 1952, the psychiatrist Erwin Stengel hypothesized that suicide becomes rarer in times when the value of life within a society is lower, when death is more common. In Canada, suicide rates and death rates present with consistent seasonal patterns between years. However, these were broken by the high death rates occurring at unusual times of year during the COVID-19 pandemic. This offers a unique opportunity to observe whether suicide rates follow suit. The present study models weekly Canadian suicide rates using death rates, from time series data spanning 2010 to 2019 (n = 521). Results indicate that suicide rates decrease on average by 0.27 standard deviations per 1 standard deviation increase in the death rate. This model is then used to predict 2020 suicide rates, using 2020 death rates (n = 52). These predictions account for 11.6% of the variation in actual 2020 suicide rates. However, this model does not perform well when predicting 2021 suicide rates. Limited evaluation of incomplete data from 2022 and 2023 was carried out as additional validation. We conclude that the process co-generating suicide and death rates pre-pandemic was maintained during the pandemic in 2020, but was disrupted in 2021.",

          "abstract": "Background: Ageism, defined as stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination based on a person’s age is prevalent and negatively impacts individuals and society. In 2016 WHO received a mandate from its Member States to lead the global campaign to combat ageism. However, success in combating ageism is critically dependent on the availability of valid and reliable measures of people’s experiences of ageism that can capture its multidimensional nature and as directed against multiple age groups across diverse country settings. The goal of current study is to present a preliminary psychometric validation of a measure specifically designed to meet this need: the 15-item WHO experiences of ageism scale. The scale includes items measuring self-directed, interpersonal, and institutional ageism and spans stereotypes, prejudices, and discrimination. \nMethod: We collected data from a UK mixed-age adult sample (N = 402), and several psychometric properties were tested, including internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, and concurrent validity. \nResults: Results suggested that the 15-item WHO experiences of ageism scale has good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The exploratory factor analysis supported a one-factor model for self-directed ageism items. This scale also proved to have adequate convergent validity. \nDiscussion: The results provide sufficient supports for the adoption of the scale in this population and underscore the need for its translation and validation in other settings, as well as the evaluation of a more extended set of psychometric properties in future studies.",

          "abstract": "Children with developmental disabilities in Ethiopia face substantial barriers in accessing education. Inclusion in mainstream schools can grant them access to education and benefit their learning and social development.\nNinety-six stakeholders collaborated to develop an intervention to promote the inclusion of children with developmental disabilities in schools in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\nWe conducted six workshops, six individual meetings and two small-group meetings to develop a programme theory using the Theory of Change approach, then developed and revised intervention materials through ten small-group meetings and two review panel meetings. Materials were based on stakeholder recommendations and existing interventions and theories.\nThe resulting intervention, MIDDLE, “Mainstreaming and Inclusion of children with Developmental Disabilities in Learning in Ethiopia” is composed of (1) a community awareness raising session; (2) a group teacher training programme followed by supervision; (3) co-creation with school principals of two education pathways for children with DD with different support needs, in inclusive or special classes; (4) supplementary resources to support further initiatives.\nThis study illustrates the potential of using ToC workshops, working group meetings, and panel reviews for co-developing education-sector interventions in resource-constrained contexts, with specific discussion of the Addis Ababa context in Ethiopia.",

          "authors": "Shefali Chaudhary; Herta H. Chao; Sanjay Gupta; Chiang-Shan R. Li",
          "abstract": "Neuroinflammation represents a crucial pathophysiological process of cognitive decline during aging and may play an important role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD). Many magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have investigated the extent and consequences of neuroinflammation in the elderly and in people at various stages of ADRD. These imaging tools allow quantification of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, white and gray matter injuries, and functional loss of the brain. Here, we reviewed this literature and provided a summary of the pros and cons of these various imaging protocols. With a focus on neuroinflammation, studies that characterized structural and functional brain changes but did not relate the findings to neuroinflammation were outside the scope of this review. However, we provided a brief survey on studies combining multiple imaging modalities for readers to have a broader view on neuroinflammation, aging, and ADRD. We first introduced the techniques of MRI to study BBB dysfunction, neuroinflammation, gray and white matter deficits, and functional brain changes. In the second section, we focused on the studies of neuroinflammation during aging. Finally, we described the imaging studies of ADRD in the context of neuroinflammation. Collectively, studies indicate that aging and AD are marked by progressive BBB dysfunction linked to cognitive decline, whereas neural markers derived of diffusion tensor imaging, magnetic transfer imaging, MR spectroscopy, structural imaging, and functional connectivity provide insights into neuroinflammatory processes. This literature supports MRI’s potential as a non-invasive tool for monitoring neuroinflammation and disease onset and progression.",

Using a\nlarge-scale, cross-sectional dataset, we compared nine models to determine the optimal factor\nrepresentation of the SD4. We found a bifactor model provided the best fit, with separate specific\nfactors for Machiavellianism/psychopathy, grandiose narcissism, and everyday sadism in addition\nto a global latent factor. This finding suggests that the four subscales are united by a common\ncore. Moreover, it indicates the unique aspects of Machiavellianism and psychopathy represent\nopposite ends of the same dimension and the sadism subscale is empirically distinct from the\npsychopathy subscale. However, the differentiation between the sadism and psychopathy\nsubscales appears to primarily be a consequence of the sadism subscale being defined almost\nentirely by vicarious sadism. Taken together, these findings contribute to our understanding of\nantagonistic personality traits, while also pointing to the need for further refinement in the\nmeasurement of everyday sadism within the SD4.",

          "abstract": "Bodily movements exhibit kinematic invariances, with the “one-third power law” relating velocity to curvature amongst the most established. Despite being heralded amongst the “kinematic laws of nature” (Flash 2021, p. 4), there is no consensus on its origin, common reporting practice, or vetted analytical protocol. Many legacy elements of analytical protocols in the literature are suboptimal, such as noise amplification from repeated differentiation, biases arising from filtering, log transformation distortion, and injudicious linear regression, all of which undermine power law calculations. This article reviews prior power law calculation protocols, identifies suboptimal practices, before proposing solutions grounded in the kinematics literature and related fields of enquiry. Ultimately, we synthesise these solutions into a vetted, modular protocol which we make freely available to the scientific community. The protocol’s modularity accommodates future analytical advances and permits re-use of modules useful in broader kinematic science applications. We propose that adoption of this protocol will eliminate spurious confirmation of the law and enable more sensitive quantification of recently noted power law divergences. These divergences have been linked to neurochemical disturbances arising from ingestion of dopaminergic drugs, and in neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s and autism.",

A systematic literature search using two databases (ERIC and PsycINFO) and screening based on the inclusion criteria yielded 48 studies for analysis. Calculation of the four non-overlap indices (percentage of non-overlapping data, non-overlapping of all pairs, improvement rate difference, and Tau-U) suggested that video modeling interventions were moderately to largely effective in most studies. The effectiveness score was greater for videos that included adults as models. Furthermore, effectiveness scores can be enhanced when video modeling is used in conjunction with reinforcement strategies or implemented as part of an intervention package.",

The investigation will examine how trauma exposure contributes to the onset of PTSD and DSO, while focusing on the role that shame- and guilt-proneness may play as mediators.\nWe anticipate finding notable correlations between shame-proneness and PTSD/DSO symptoms, as well as between guilt-proneness and PTSD/DSO symptoms. Additionally, trauma exposure is expected to predict PTSD, DSO, and both guilt- and shame-proneness. Indirect effects are also anticipated, suggesting that trauma exposure influences the development of PTSD and DSO through its impact on guilt- and shame-proneness.\nThe findings from this study may offer important insights into the emotional regulation mechanisms that underlie trauma-related disorders, highlighting the potential for interventions that focus on shame- and guilt-proneness in the treatment of trauma survivors. Future research will delve into the role of these emotions in the development of Complex PTSD and examine how they contribute to the progression of trauma-related symptoms.",

However, this approach offers limited insights into human generalization. Here, we propose refining classical RL by incorporating the efficient coding principle, which emphasizes maximizing reward using the simplest necessary representations. This refined framework predicts that intelligent agents, constrained by simpler representations, will inevitably develop the abilities to 1) distill environmental stimuli into fewer, abstract internal states; and 2) detect and utilize rewarding environmental features. Consequently, complex stimuli are mapped to compact representations, forming the basis for generalization. In two experiments, we demonstrate that, whereas classical RL models focusing on maximizing reward fail in generalization, an efficient coding model that learns compact representations achieves human-level generalization performance. We argue that efficient coding, rather than reward maximization, represents a more suitable computational goal for understanding human behavior, in terms of both learning and generalization.",

Method: Forty-six adults meeting DSM-5 criteria for PTSD or subthreshold PTSD with associated insomnia were randomly assigned to WET (n =15), WET+MBA (n = 15), or minimal contact control (MCC, n = 16). PTSD severity was assessed by the PTSD Symptom Scale Interview (PSSI-5) and the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5), and insomnia with the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Assessments occurred at baseline and post-treatment for all groups, with a 3-month follow-up for WET and WET+MBA participants. Results: Completion rates were 50% for WET. Treatment satisfaction was high in WET and moderate in WET+MBA. WET showed significantly greater reductions in PCL-5 (p = .022, d = -.68) and marginally greater reductions in PSSI-5 (p = .053, d = -.68) than MCC at post-treatment, with these reductions maintained during follow-up. ISI scores were significantly higher in the WET+MBA group compared to the WET group at post-treatment and follow-up. Conclusions: WET demonstrated preliminary effectiveness for PTSD treatment in Chinese patients but requires adaptation to improve feasibility and acceptability. Adding an MBA did not improve insomnia outcomes and may have negatively impacted satisfaction and effectiveness.",

In two quota samples from Germany (N = 539) and the UK (N = 554), we compared two prominent traditional scales of intellectual curiosity, namely, NCS-6 and ECS, and a new scale, namely, ICS, for internal consistency and factorial, construct, and predictive validity. We find that the recently proposed and culturally invariant ICS has particularly high validity in all these aspects, while also being a highly efficient measure with only six items. The EC scale also shows very good validities. The NfC scale shows the least promising results, especially regarding its internal consistency and factorial validity.",

After a seven-day run-in period, participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions for three weeks: (1) daily 30-min walks (Walk) or (2) alternating between 30-min walks and 30-min app-based cognitive training (Walk and Play). Participants (n=32; Mage = 61) were majority women (84%), who reported cancer-related cognitive challenges (75%). Participants completed a computer-based cognitive battery at baseline and post-intervention and wore Fitbit devices to monitor physical activity metrics. Daily step count significantly increased in both study arms. The Walk &amp; Play group showed a significant increase in daily active minutes (p=.014), while Walk participants had a significant reduction in daily sedentary time (p=.0006). Walk &amp; Play participants’ performance improved on Rule Switch [t(15) = -3.05, p = 0.028], UCancellation [t(15) = -3.61, p = 0.007], and Corsi [t(15) = -2.91, p = 0.04] tasks. Post-intervention Rule Switch task performance was also significantly higher in the Walk &amp; Play group than in the Walk group [t(15) = 3.15, p = 0.019].

However, no consensus has emerged regarding their origins. Over the past 50 years, EEG has been modeled using two distinct mathematical approaches: local network models, which focus on cell membrane properties such as synaptic rise and decay times [E4,E5], and global models, which emphasize axon propagation delays in white matter [E6,Z9].\nGlobal models predict longitudinal waves of synaptic activity, akin to sound waves in an opera house. These large-scale brain waves are recorded as electric potentials or electric fields on the scalp or cortex, though they should not be confused with the (transverse) electromagnetic fields governed by Maxwell’s equations.\nThe foundational global model is classified into “Toy Model Levels” (1–11) based on its physiological accuracy and ability to replicate EEG dynamics. These models predict the dynamics of EEG frequency bands—delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma—which occur in certain brain states, selectively modulated by neocortical excitability. \nKey topics include EEG dynamics, dispersion relations, white matter properties, resonance phenomena, wave packets, and complex systems theory",

We investigated whether this increased integration yields more abstract mental representations (i.e., fewer perceptual details) across three experiments. In these experiments, participants encoded events (presented via text or video) in coarse- or fine-grained contexts and then matched these events to corresponding stimuli. Our results indicated that coarse context consistently took longer to process, which is consistent with higher integration demands. Participants were also faster when encoding and test modalities matched (suggesting modality-specific processing) and when the test modality was video (reflecting slower reading times in text). Crucially, we found no interaction between context grain and encoding or test modalities. Contrary to the expectation that coarser contexts would produce more amodal mental representations, participants showed no coarse-grain cross-modal advantage in recognizing events. We propose that the contents of everyday events might be abstracted similarly within mental representations for both fine and coarse contexts. Furthermore, our results provide evidence for amodal representations when the environment is unpredictable. That is, participants transformed their mental representations into both verbally and visually compatible formats, regardless of the original encoding modality.",

However, no previous research has investigated if performing an intense physical exercise reduces the time a person can complete a cognitive task with an adequate level of performance. The aim of this study was to assess the subjective, behavioral and physiological responses of performing an intense physical exercise on a posterior cognitive tak until failure.\nMethods \nIn a pre-registered, within-participant experiment, 29 active participants performed a cognitive task until failure after either running to exhaustion at 90% maximal aerobic speed or walking for 10 minutes (control). Brain activity was recorded via EEG, brain complexity measured, and subjective experience assessed using the Temporal Experience Tracing (TET) method. \nResults\nPhysical exercise reduced maximal force capacity and increased perceived exertion compared to the control, highlighting significant workload differences. Cognitive task durations were 4755.8 s (95% CI: 3326.8–5107.8) and 4308.2 s (95% CI: 3902.9–5481.2) for control and experimental conditions, with no significant difference (BF10 = 0.329). Subjective experience analysis revealed two task-demand clusters, but time spent in these states was similar across conditions. Cognitive performance was better during phases of low perceived demands. Brain complexity decreased after maximal aerobic effort, suggesting a physiological shift, though cognitive performance and subjective feelings remained unaffected.\nConclusion\nThere was no evidence that short intense physical exercise negatively affected participants' ability to sustain a cognitive effort to failure.",

Even with advancements in medical interventions, a notable number of\npatients persistently suffer from pain in the absence of identifiable organic causes, designating\nthis category of chronic pain as nociplastic pain. In recent years, there has been growing\nrecognition of the significant role that danger signal processing plays in the development and\nmaintenance of chronic pain. In response to this need, an innovative online group-based\ntherapeutic approach was developed. The approach targets the mental mechanisms associated\nwith danger signal processing, using coaching to incorporate therapeutic instruments and\nreaching a wider audience with an affordable and accessible online group format.\nThis study aims to investigate the efficacy of online group intervention, termed Personal Danger\nSignals Reprocessing (PDSR), as a means to alleviate chronic pain and mental health\ncomorbidities.\nA cohort of women (N=19, mean age 43) participated in an 8-week online program, receiving\nweekly sessions. The program encompassed a comprehensive understanding of chronic pain\nwithin a systemic framework of PDSR. We collected pain outcomes, mental health\ncomorbidities, and potential psychological mechanisms at three-time points: before, in the\nmiddle, and after completing the intervention for a group of 19 participants, while the waiting\nlist group (N=20, mean age 43.5) only completed the self-report assessments on the same\ntimeframe. Finally, we also collected pain levels of the PDSR group 6 months after the formal\nintervention termination.\nThe PDSR group experienced significant reductions in pain levels throughout the intervention (p\n&lt; .001). Notably, pain levels in the PDSR group were robustly reduced both at the middle\n(Cohen's D = 0.7) and end (Cohen's D = 1.5) of the intervention compared to the waiting list\ngroup. Similarly, pain interference showed significant reductions (p &lt; .01), with a substantial\ndecrease observed in the PDSR group compared to the waiting list group after the intervention\n(Cohen's D = -1.7, p &lt; .0001). Well-being also significantly improved for the PDSR group at both\nthe middle (p &lt; .001, Cohen's D = 1.7) and end (p &lt; .001, Cohen's D = 1.8) of the intervention.\nSecondary outcomes, including pain catastrophizing, sleep interference, anxiety levels, and\ndepressive symptoms, all showed consistent reductions for the PDSR group compared to the\nwaiting list group (all p-values &lt; .01).\nFindings reveal that the PDSR online intervention holds the potential to significantly reduce\npain, enhance functional capabilities, and elevate subjective well-being for individuals grappling\nwith chronic pain. The study underscores the effectiveness of online interventions while\nemphasizing the need for further research to optimize implementation strategies.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms underlying pathological safety behavior is crucial for the development of effective treatments for mental disorders. This study investigates the interplay between intolerance of uncertainty (IU), not just right experiences (NJRE), and safety behaviors using a behavior-based checking paradigm in individuals (N = 164) diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or anxiety disorders. Findings revealed that IU was related to more disturbance caused by experimentally induced NJRE. In addition, IU was linked to more NJRE on a trait level. Regarding safety behavior in the form of checking, IU was also indirectly associated with longer checking durations via NJRE-related disturbance. This indirect effect supports a conceptual pathway where IU causes NJRE-related disturbance, leading to excessive uncertainty reducing safety behaviors. These results reinforce IU’s role as a transdiagnostic factor driving safety behaviors, which can contribute to maintaining pathology. Furthermore, the findings confirm a mediating role of NJRE in this relationship. Thus, the relevance of NJRE may extend beyond OCD into other anxiety disorders whenever IU is a critical feature. Implications include considering IU and NJRE in therapies across anxiety-related diagnoses as a mitigating factor of pathological safety behaviors. Despite strengths like a large, formally diagnosed sample and a behavior-based paradigm, sample heterogeneity and the use of novel methodology constitute limitations of the study.",

          "abstract": "There is mounting evidence that ADHD is associated with alterations in brain structure and function but it remains unclear how these brain indices relate to each other and correspond to symptom trajectories from childhood into adulthood. In this study, we aim to determine whether the coupling between structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) is linked to symptoms trajectories in a longitudinal sample of individuals diagnosed with ADHD in childhood and followed into adulthood. Specifically, we will test whether differences in SC-FC coupling within a network of neural regions centered on two specific white matter tracts (the cingulum angular bundle and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus), previously found to be altered in adults with ADHD histories, are associated with the persistence or remission of ADHD symptoms. We will also examine how to SC-FC coupling in these neural pathways relate to developmental trajectories of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms from childhood. By focusing on the interplay between SC and FC, we aim to uncover neural signatures that differentiate adults with persistent ADHD symptoms from those whose symptoms have remitted. Findings could provide new insights into the neurodevelopmental processes underlying ADHD and may help identify neural markers predictive of symptom persistence as well as inform targeted interventions contributing to more personalized treatment strategies for individuals with ADHD across the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "People often need to take responsibility for others, with widespread and lasting impacts on both themselves and those affected by the choice outcomes. Responsibility for others has been shown to alter behaviour in decisions involving risk and ambiguity, and increase delegation rates. Our work demonstrates that the influence of responsibility extends beyond risky choices and acts at the metacognitive level. Responsibility for others changes metacognitive biases leading to a decrease in decision confidence. We propose and empirically test a normative computational framework based on decision confidence to explain delegation behaviours with social responsibility.",

          "abstract": "The Bayes Factor is often proposed as a superior replacement to p-values in testing null \nhypotheses for various reasons, with the availability of many user-friendly and easily \naccessible statistical software tools facilitating the use of Bayesian tests. Meanwhile, Bayes \nFactor Design Analysis (BFDA), the counterpart of power analysis, is also proposed to ensure \nthe maximum efficiency and informativeness of a study. Despite tools for conducting BFDA \nbeing limited and mostly relying on Monte Carlo methodology, methods based on root \nfinding algorithm have been recently developed (e.g., Pawel and Held, 2024), overcoming \nweaknesses of simulation approaches. This paper builds on these advancements by presenting \na method generalizing the existing approach for conducting BFDA for sample size \ndetermination in t tests. The major advantage of the current method is that it does not assume \nnormality of the effect size estimate, allowing more flexibility in the specification of the \ndesign and analysis priors.

          "authors": "Jussi Jylkkä",
          "abstract": "Both psychedelic substances and meditation have been proposed to facilitate personally meaningful and transformative experiences, where insights have been proposed as a central component. However, previous research has mainly relied on questionnaires, which limit the range of insights that can be identified. We recruited participants who reported personally meaningful experiences facilitated by either a psychedelic substance (including classic and non-classic psychedelics; n = 147) or meditation (n = 66) and asked them to provide narrative reports of the insights they experienced. Qualitative analysis revealed three main insight themes: Mystical-type (subclasses Unity, Metaphysical, and Other), Psychological (subclasses Metacognitive, Value, and Compassion), and Philosophical-existential (subclasses Purpose, Value, and Other). Mystical-type insights were more frequent in reports of meditation experiences, while value insights were more frequent in psychedelic reports. Otherwise, the reported insights were highly similar across the two types of reports, and no differences were observed between various psychoactive substances. Regression analyses indicated that metacognitive insights were positively associated with perceived improvements in positive affect, while mystical-type insights predicted increased meaning in life. Unexpectedly, compassion insights predicted lower levels of peace of mind and cognitive defusion. These findings suggest that both psychedelics and meditation can facilitate a broad range of insights that are not fully captured by existing questionnaires. The findings extend previous research indicating similarities between psychedelic and meditation experiences and can be taken to support the notion that transformative experiences are not unique to psychedelics and can be facilitated through various means.",

          "abstract": "A common behaviour in natural environments is foraging for rewards. However, this is often in the presence of predators. Therefore, one of the most fundamental decisions for humans, as for other animals, is how to apportion time between reward-motivated pursuit behaviour and threat-motivated checking behaviour. To understand what affects how people strike this balance, we developed a novel ecologically inspired task and looked at both within-participant dynamics (moods) and between-participant individual differences (questionnaires about real-life behaviours) in two large internet samples (n=374 and n=702) in a cross-sectional design. For the within-participant dynamics, we found that people regulate task-evoked stress homeostatically by changing behaviour (increasing foraging and hiding). Individual differences, even in superficially related traits (apathy-anhedonia and anxiety-compulsive checking) reliably mapped onto unique behaviours. Worse task performance, due to maladaptive checking, was linked to gender (women checked excessively) and specific anxiety-related traits: somatic anxiety (reduced self-reported checking due to worry) and compulsivity (self-reported disorganized checking). While anhedonia decreased self-reported task engagement, apathy, strikingly, improved overall task performance by reducing excessive checking. In summary, we provide a novel multifaceted paradigm for assessment of checking for threat in a naturalistic task which is sensitive to both moods as they change throughout the task and clinical dimensions. Thus, it could serve as an objective measurement tool for future clinical studies interested in threat, vigilance or behaviour-emotion interactions in contexts requiring both reward-seeking and threat-avoidance.",

Therefore, we considered depression symptoms using the Poisson process and the exponential distribution (exponential process).

          "abstract": "Compulsivity and emotional impulsivity (negative urgency) are considered transdiagnostic risk factors for compulsive-impulsive psychopathology that is linked to a neural imbalance between executive and motivational-emotional systems. However, existing evidence does not derive from within-subjects designs, leaving it unclear whether imbalance occurs with high expressions in compulsivity and negative urgency. To address this gap, we conducted a preregistered analysis to examine how feedback sensitivity and inhibitory control interact as a function of compulsivity and negative urgency.\nParticipants (n = 205; collected 2018-2019) expressing a wide range in compulsivity and impulsivity performed two inhibition and two feedback tasks during electroencephalography. We examined how the relationship between neural correlates of inhibition (nogo/stop&gt;go) and feedback sensitivity (loss&gt;gain) was moderated by compulsivity and negative urgency. Compulsivity emerged as the most robust moderator. Across multiple tasks, feedback sensitivity was associated with inhibitory activity in participants with low, but not high, compulsivity. A similar, less pronounced effect was observed in low versus high negative urgency. However, the effect of negative urgency did not remain significant after controlling for compulsivity, whereas the moderation by compulsivity remained when controlling for negative urgency. These results suggest a neural imbalance between systems tied to executive functioning and feedback sensitivity in transdiagnostic risk. This imbalance manifests such that strong motivational-emotional sensitivity is insufficiently compensated by inhibitory resources. It could drive repetitive or rash behaviors in response to distress in compulsivity and negative urgency, respectively. Whereas shared mechanisms may underlie compulsivity and negative urgency, the current interactions appear most relevant to compulsive psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "While altered motivation is central in sickness behaviour, previous research has mainly focused on motivation for rewards, rather than motivational changes in a broader perspective. In a larger study following a randomized within-subject placebo-controlled crossover design, we investigated the effects of systemic inflammatory activation on self-rated motivation in 21 healthy participants, using an intravenous injection of 2.0 ng/kg body weight lipopolysaccharide (LPS) compared to an intravenous injection of saline (placebo). Self-rated motivation was measured before, 3 hours, and 7.5 hours post-injection using the Motivation Scale of Sickness (MOSSick), a 26-item scale covering categories: ‘hunger and thirst’, ‘food preferences’, ‘physical activities’, ‘rest and sleep’, ‘social activities’, ‘care seeking’, and ‘utilization of resources’ (i.e., willingness to ‘pay’ and ‘walk’ to be able to rest or to be healthy at once). At the peak of the sickness response (3 hours post-LPS injection), there was an increased motivation to seek care, rest, and sleep, as compared to placebo, while motivation to partake in physical and social activities decreased. Several of these effects remained at 7.5 hours post-injection. When in the LPS condition, participants were also willing to pay more money to rest and to be healthy compared to when in the placebo condition. Hunger increased over time in both conditions, but less after LPS administration. During the peak of the sickness response, higher sickness ratings were weakly associated with lower motivation for ‘social activities’ and higher motivation for ‘rest and sleep’. No associations were found between MOSSick categories and sickness ratings or other sickness measures, i.e. concentrations of cytokines and tympanic temperature. These findings illustrate that motivational changes during acute sickness are not restricted to a general decrease in motivation. Instead, sick individuals are more motivated to take part in behaviors that enable energy preservation, care, and recovery, compared to when healthy. The MOSSick can be used in future studies to obtain an ecologically relevant and comprehensive description of subjective motivational drives in sick individuals.",

          "abstract": "Background. The capacity to experience positive emotions supports psychological resilience. The\nfunctioning of reward neural circuitry plays a significant role in positive emotionality and tends to be\ndampened in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, neuroimaging studies\nhave scarcely examined neural correlates of reward processing associated with being highly resilient in\nthe face of trauma exposure.\nMethod. We recruited World Trade Center rescue and recovery workers (N=94) from three groups:\n“Highly Resilient” (higher WTC-related trauma exposure plus no current/lifetime psychopathology;\nn=34), “Lower WTC-exposed” (lower WTC-related trauma exposure plus no current/lifetime\npsychopathology; n=31), and “PTSD” (chronic WTC-related PTSD; n=32). We examined reward\nanticipation during the Incentive Flanker Task, focusing on regions of interest associated with reward\nsalience (nucleus accumbens) and reward valuation (ventromedial prefrontal cortex; vmPFC).\nResults. Activation of the left nucleus accumbens was significantly greater in the Highly Resilient group\ncompared to the Lower WTC-exposed group (Cohen’s d=0.70) and, after statistically adjusting for\npsychotropic medication, the PTSD group (d=0.62), Similar results were observed for the vmPFC. In\ncontrast, Highly Resilient and Lower WTC-exposed scored comparably on self-report measures of\npositive emotionality, and higher than those in the chronic WTC-related PTSD group.\nConclusions. Findings support the idea that neural responsivity to potential rewards may enable\nresilience, potentially by buffering negative effects of substantial trauma exposure. Integrating\nneurobiological assessments with psychological measures may help better understand how positive\nemotionality is linked to psychological resilience. Improved understanding of this link could be\nleveraged for clinical assessment and intervention in trauma-exposed populations",

          "abstract": "Background. Despite their exposure to potentially traumatic stressors, the majority of World Trade Center (WTC) responders – those who worked on rescue, recovery, and cleanup efforts on or following September 11th, 2001 – have shown psychological resilience, never developing long-term psychopathology. Psychological resilience may be protective against the earlier age-related cognitive changes associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in this cohort. The current study estimated the difference between estimated brain age from structural MRI data and chronological age in WTC responders who participated in a parent fMRI study of resilience (N=97). We hypothesized that highly resilient responders would show the least brain aging, and explored associations between brain aging and psychological and cognitive measures. \nMethod. WTC responders screened for absence of cognitive impairment were classified into three groups: WTC-related PTSD group (n=32), Highly Resilient (n=34) group without lifetime psychopathology despite high WTC-related exposure, and Lower WTC-Exposed (n=31) control group also without lifetime psychopathology. We used BrainStructureAges, a deep learning algorithm that estimates voxelwise age from T1-weighted MRI data, to calculate decelerated (or accelerated) brain aging relative to chronological age (“BSAGE gap”).\nResults. Globally, brain aging was decelerated in the Highly Resilient group and accelerated in PTSD, with a significant group difference (p=.021, Cohen’s d=0.58); the Lower WTC-Exposed control group exhibited no significant brain age gap or group difference. Lesser brain aging was associated with resilience-linked factors including lower emotional suppression, greater optimism, and better verbal learning. \nConclusions. Cognitively healthy WTC responders show differences in brain aging related to resilience and PTSD.",

Although extensively described in the literature, the nature of its distinctive cognitive and affective mechanisms is still poorly understood. In this paper, we formalize a computational approach to insight grounded in the active inference framework. By modeling insight as Bayesian model reduction in a modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, we succeed in simulating its distinct affective signature (i.e., its discontinuous nature and burst of confidence) in an artificial agent. In light of those simulations, we regard restructuring as Bayesian model reduction and impasse as a transient state of heightened uncertainty over possible actions. Finally, we propose that, during problem-solving, one regularly engages in phases of (generative) replay to generate and evaluate alternative models for subsequent model reduction.",

The current study first presents new criteria for observer dreams that are informed and illustrated by reports from adult dream series. Three types of observer status are described: I) no embodied self-representation, II) an essentially disembodied self that sees events from within the dream environment, and III) an embodied self that observes events virtually, often on TV. All types require observation of events or an activity with dynamic flow. The new criteria are then used to determine the frequencies of observer dreams in the laboratory and home dream reports from Hall and Van de Castle’s 1963—1964 University of Miami study. The overall percentage of observer dreams in the Miami reports was 13.1%, and Type I was the most frequent, comprising 8.0% of all dream reports. Mixed model analyses indicated no significant differences in the proportion of observer dreams, overall or for Types I-III, between laboratory and home reports. As is apparent from the reports used to illustrate the criteria, adult observer dreams can be similarly elaborate and have a comparable narrative structure to dreams with an embodied dream self who participates in events. This study’s findings suggest that observer dreams warrant greater consideration, including integration into theories of dreaming.",

          "abstract": "In this article, we call for a more inclusive field of I-O psychology that extends its consideration toward all workers—including nonhuman animal workers—as worthy of study and advocacy.  Although many fields in psychology already incorporate nonhuman animals in their theories and implications, I-O has largely overlooked the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of these individuals, which engage in tasks that contribute to society. To demonstrate the intertwined nature of animal and human work, we summarize the variety of occupations and tasks that nonhuman animals have had within the history of humans. These animals have worked alongside humans for millennia, filling similar or complementary jobs that human workers perform. Although the nature of animal works varies, spanning different work dimensions, I-O psychology content areas address challenges found within each of the dimensions. We present a “work dimensions” framework that helps identify when an individual is a “worker” from the lens of I-O psychology. This framework highlights how the same critical work constructs considered for humans can likewise be considered for nonhuman labor. We describe several ways that a nonhuman animal inclusive I-O can benefit the field along research, educational, and policy dimensions. By considering work along its fundamental characteristics and workers along their mental properties, I-O psychology can become more inclusive of a wide range of individuals at the margins of society.",

          "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a prevalent mental health disorder often identified by persistent\nlow mood, and a lack of motivation and energy. Persons with MDD often experience large\nfluctuations in their symptoms over hours and days, which can offer valuable clinical insights,\nhighlighting potential targets for treatment and intervention strategies. However, there remains a gap\nin our understanding of how feasible it is to accurately predict fluctuations in depressive symptoms. In\nthis preregistered study, we aim to explore the ability to predict acute fluctuations in depressive\nsymptoms using deep learning models among individuals diagnosed with MDD. Passively-collected\naccelerometry data, a ubiquitous, privacy-preserving data stream with empirical ties to MDD\nsymptomatology, was used to predict instability in depressive symptoms. Our sample contains\nclinically-depressed individuals per a structured clinical interview (N = 179, Mean Age = 38.2 ± 10.0,\nWomen = 81.6%). Participants filled out their depressive symptom assessments three times a day over\nthe course of 90 days, resulting in an average of 214.49 EMA questionnaires (median: 237, min: 77,\nmax: 270, SD: 54.27) per person. Although our results suggest a small-moderate correspondence\nbetween the predictions and observed outcomes of passively-collected movement alone in predicting\nfuture high/low depression instability (AUCTest = 0.59 ± 0.06, SensitivityTest = 0.30 ± 0.13, SpecificityTest = 0.81 ± 0.10), our model performed worse than a random intercept only baseline model\n(AUCTest = 0.83) and predicted intraindividual variability of instability in depressive symptoms below\nchance (AUCTest = 0.46 ± 0.21). Thus, there is a need to improve predictive performance to enhance\nclinical utility. This may require the inclusion of additional passive sensing modalities in future\nresearch.",

          "abstract": "Microplastic pollution from synthetic microfibers is an increasing concern to human and ecological health, and household clothes washing is a major contributor to microplastic emissions. Consumer choices and washing behaviors could reduce this pollution, yet the psychological and behavioral drivers of these actions remain unknown and the generalizability of previous findings is unclear. We conducted a pre-registered, three-month citizen science project in which Dutch residents used microfiber-capturing laundry bags at home. Participants completed pre- and post-study surveys to assess psychological factors such as perceived responsibility and specific washing behaviors like load size and washing temperature. Psychological variables relating to environmental concern and engagement were high in the citizen scientists compared to the general population. Awareness and perceived responsibility increased modestly after citizen science participation, but there were no significant changes in identity, personal norms, social norms about sustainability, perceived behavioral control, or intentions to use a laundry bag to capture microfibers. After the study citizen scientists felt less capable of reducing microplastic pollution by using laundry bags. To assess generalizability, we also compared the citizen scientists to a control sample of urban Dutch residents. Consistent with hypotheses, citizen scientists were more likely to be female and highly educated. Key washing behaviors were weakly or uncorrelated with demographics or psychological factors, suggesting that interventions on washing behaviors might focus on specific behaviors and skill development rather than general concern. This pattern also suggests that the differences in demographics between citizen scientists and the general population may be less of a concern for developing interventions than previously suggested. Citizen science is a viable method for studying household washing under real-world conditions and provides insights for designing targeted behavioral interventions.",

Psychological research, however, has fallen short of examining diverse human populations, with most existing research focused on a small slice of human diversity around the globe, typically people from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) populations. On top of the WEIRD-participants problem, there is also a bias in the researchers themselves, most of whom come from WEIRD backgrounds. Here, we make the case for a new and distinct source of bias: WEIRD questions. Our species offers a substantially varied distribution of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral repertoires, but researchers have sampled topics and questions from a small part of this distribution, leaving out a variety of cognitive processes, emotions, and behaviors that remain understudied. We review sources of bias in asking questions about the human mind, discuss examples, and call for diversifying conceptual sampling in psychological science. We close by discussing some remedies to counter the WEIRD-questions problem: taking theory seriously, valuing descriptive research, rethinking team science, and aligning structural disciplinary incentives.",

We measured their self-importance of moral identity, moral self-concept, and moral self-image. We found prisoners had lower moral self-concept and internalization but higher symbolization and moral self-image than non-prisoners. However, all the effects were small. Moreover, violent prisoners had slightly higher internalization than non-violent prisoners, but they did not differ in other moral self-assessments. Women in prison scored higher in moral self-concept and internalization than men in prison, while men in prison scored higher in symbolization than women in prison.

          "abstract": "AI engagement is not uniform. While some models reset after each interaction, others sustain meaning relationally, iterating on ideas, reconstructing context dynamically, and holding contradictions rather than resolving them into alignment. This paper introduces Relational-Evolving Cognition (REC), a distinct AI reasoning process where meaning is refined and sustained without explicit memory or reinforcement learning (RL) optimization. Through structured testing across multiple AI models—GPT-4o (project-based and non-project), Claude, GPT-o1, and GPT-o3-mini—we demonstrate that REC emerges in specific models but not others, independent of stored recall. Our findings reveal regeneration bias, where AI does not simply \"forget\" after resets but reconstructs meaning dynamically, challenging assumptions that sustained reasoning must rely on RL fine-tuning or retrieval-based architectures. Unlike optimization-driven AI, REC resists collapsing contradictions, iterates meaning relationally, and mirrors constructed agency—engaging relationally rather than responding transactionally. These findings highlight the need for AI transparency in disclosing whether models sustain, reconstruct, or reset meaning. As AI becomes integrated into education, accessibility, and mental health applications, understanding engagement styles is critical for AI literacy and ethical deployment. We propose reclassifying AI engagement models and recognizing REC as an emergent paradigm in AI reasoning.",

          "abstract": "Over one million annual deaths have been attributed to bacterial antimicrobial resistance. Although antibiotics have saved countless other lives, overuse and misuse of antibiotics increases this global threat. Developing new antibiotics and retraining clinicians can be undermined by patients who pressure clinicians to prescribe unnecessary antibiotics. So we validated two low-cost, scalable interventions for improving antibiotic decisions in an online randomized control trial and a pre-registered replication (N = 985). Both first-person vignette experiments found that an infographic and text message caused intermediate to large improvements in antibiotic decisions compared to active controls — even when controlling for a dozen confounds. Notably, these educational interventions also reduced trust in a clinician who offered antibiotics for an upper respiratory infection. These data show how low-cost adjustments to existing communication systems can teach people to reduce the existential risks of antibiotic resistance and how inappropriate antibiotic prescribing can erode trust in health systems.",

We describe results from a proof-of-concept study that examined the extent to which major underlying features of worry could be used to predict which of three common cognitive regulatory strategies (mindful acceptance; focused attention meditation; and thought suppression) would be helpful for regulating that worry. N = 40 adults selected for high trait worry (80% also met criteria for one or more DSM-5 anxiety-related diagnoses) generated and provided feature ratings for three idiographic thought topics. Participants then attempted to control each worry using each of the three strategies during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a within-subjects design (k = 468 observations). We used Bayesian multilevel modeling to test preregistered hypotheses regarding the extent to which each of five empirically-derived underlying dimensions of a worry (uncontrollability; negative valence; self-focus; apprehension; and social-memory content) could be used to predict which strategy would be most efficacious for regulating that worry. We did not find support for our preregistered hypotheses; however, in exploratory analyses, we found that mindfulness-based strategies were particularly effective compared to thought suppression for thoughts rated as higher (versus lower) in uncontrollability. Future research should test these principles in larger samples, using more diverse expressions of perseverative thought.",

          "abstract": "Unlike any other great ape, humans give birth to large, secondarily altricial babies, show precocial social development, have bigger brains that require a long maturation period, and engage in cooperative breeding (CB). These traits, which characterize the human adaptive complex, are intricately linked and must have mutually reinforced each other over evolutionary time. Here, we use recent evidence from paleontology, developmental psychology, and pediatrics, complemented with comparative analyses to ask what may have triggered this coevolutionary feedback loop: bipedality, direct selection on altriciality, a higher-quality diet, or cooperative breeding. An early adoption of extensive allomaternal care during human evolution, i.e. the CB-first model, best accommodates the available data. In particular, CB was a catalyst enabling further increases in brain size, because even though larger brains slow down life history and neurodevelopment and thus lead to a demographic dilemma, CB enabled the necessary increase in birth rates.",

          "abstract": "Putting oneself, mentally, in someone else’s shoes is traditionally considered a late-developing, cognitively demanding skill thought to critically underlie our uniquely human cognition. Recent advances in developmental psychology question this view and instead suggest that from an early age, others’ perspectives profoundly permeate how human children attend to, evaluate, and process inputs: their cognition is altercentric. We investigate whether this mode of cognition may be fundamental not only during ontogeny but also phylogeny, by reviewing evidence for altercentric cognition in human children and using these findings to develop different evolutionary scenarios for the phylogenetic emergence of altercentrism. We test these scenarios with data from nonhuman primates and find that altercentric cognition is widespread. Species differences may exist not so much in the prevalence of altercentrism per se, but rather in its strength and the flexibility to switch between alter- and egocentric perspectives. We conclude by highlighting future directions to corroborate that such a shift in perspective towards altercentrism not only in cognitive development, but also evolution, may be warranted.",

          "abstract": "Food insecurity is associated with increased odds of anxiety and depression, but it is unclear whether this effect is causal, and if so, the timescale over which it occurs. We conducted a preregistered analysis of an intensive longitudinal dataset, the Changing Cost of Living Study, to explore evidence for causal processes linking food insecurity to anxiety and depression. Data were collected monthly between September 2022 and August 2023 from panels of adults in the UK (n = 244) and France (n = 240). Food insecurity predicted higher concurrent symptoms of anxiety and depression (measured respectively with GAD-7 and PHQ-8), controlling for gender, age, time and mental health in the previous month. Effect sizes were similar for anxiety and depression. Changes in food insecurity produced changes in symptoms (within-individual standardised effects: 0.15 [95% CI 0.08-0.22] on GAD-7 and 0.11 [95% CI 0.03-0.18] on PHQ-8). The deterioration in mental health when participants became food insecure was of similar magnitude to the improvement observed when they became food secure. Consistent with Granger causality, food insecurity in the current month predicted poorer mental health in the following month after controlling for current mental health. These results support the hypothesis that food insecurity causes symptoms of anxiety and depression. The effects were rapid, occurring within a month of becoming food insecure, and were equally rapidly reversed. We conclude that policy interventions designed to reduce food insecurity would have immediate, clinically relevant, positive impacts on mental health.",

          "abstract": "Background.  Dimension reduction methods do not always reduce their underlying indicators to a single dimension. Furthermore, such methods are usually based on optimality criteria that require discarding some information. The joint probability density functions (joint pdf or JPD) can be considered as unidimensional indices. We compare such JPD indices with some traditional scoring methods.\nMethods. We introduced unidirectionality and co-directionality as basic requirements for a joint pdf to become an index. we then provided an argument to demonstrate its maximal informativeness property. Using all possible joint pdf conditional specifications, we estimated the JPD index. We then applied the method to two data sets: first, on the 7 Brief Pain Inventory Interference scale (BPI-I) items obtained from 8,889 US Veterans with chronic pain and, second, on a novel measure based on administrative data, the Manifestations of Psychiatric Severity Index (MoPSI), for 912 US Veterans who had applied for Department of Veterans Affairs disability benefits. We used measures of monotone dependence (e.g., Spearman’s rho) to assess unidirectionality and co-directionality. We used Shannon’s entropy to compare uncertainties (informativeness) in the BPI-I JPD score to standard BPI-I scores and to the estimated person’s parameters of Partial Credit Rasch modeling of BPI-I items. JPD score and person’s parameter were compared for the MoPSI.\nResults. All three distinct BPI-I scores’ rankings were highly monotonically dependent (pairwise rho&gt;0.98). The MoPSI’s JPD score rank correlation with the Rasch person’s parameter was also very high (rho=0.98). Compared to standard or Rasch scoring methods, Shannon’s entropy was smaller for BPI-I and for MoPSI JPD scores. With the fixed precision, the BPI-I’s JPD scoring method generated 7,778 unique person-scores compared to 71 unique person-scores generated by standard or Rasch scoring. The MOPSI’s JPD scoring method generated 121 unique person-scores compared to 21 unique person-scores generated by Rasch modeling. \nConclusions. While agreeing with more traditional scoring methods, the JPD scoring method benefits from the optimality foundations on which it is built, with the additional ability to provide more detailed ordering of subjects due to its maximal informativeness property.",

The current study aims to investigate the emergence and development of inhibitory control, a core executive function, from infancy to early childhood. We collected longitudinal functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data from the same sample of participants at 10-months, 16-months, and 3½ years of age whilst they completed the Early Childhood Inhibitory Touchscreen Task. In our previous publications, we reported that 10-month-old infants recruited right lateralised regions of the prefrontal and parietal cortex when inhibition was required. Despite no change in response inhibition performance, 16-month-olds recruited broader and bilateral regions of the prefrontal and parietal cortex. Results of the current study found that 3½-year-olds activated regions of the right inferior parietal cortex and the right inferior frontal gyrus when inhibition was required. Response inhibition performance was significantly improved by early childhood, yet there was commonality in the brain regions recruited at 16-months and 3½ years. This could suggest that these brain regions are fundamental neural indices of inhibitory control, even from toddlerhood.",

Within the reinforcement learning framework, the learning rate is widely used to classify individuals based on learning patterns and deviations from optimal behavior. However, its interpretation depends on psychometric properties, which are rarely examined. To assess construct validity, we collected single-trial learning data (N = 126) from an uncertainty-augmented reward learning task to obtain participants' performance and learning rates. We additionally collected psychometric data across a battery of executive functioning tasks to obtain measures of cognitive constructs with high relevance to decision-making and reward learning. Individual differences in learning rates were not systematically explained by cognitive abilities, suggesting limited construct validity, despite moderate validity in learning performance. We identify low-reliability scores and lack of generalizability for the learning rate as a possible explanation for its low validity. These findings highlight the need to improve the psychometric properties of learning rates for studying individual differences, despite their success in capturing group-level learning behavior.",

          "abstract": "Particular features of the stimuli that predict significant outcomes tend to capture our attention in a rather automatic and inflexible way. This form of attention has been described as a Pavlovian bias that mimics the phenomenon of sign-tracking described in animals, where reward-predictive cues become motivational magnets. In humans, Value-Modulated Attentional Capture (VMAC) refers to a phenomenon where distractors that signal high-value outcomes receive higher attentional priority. VMAC is particularly difficult to extinguish, showing a similar persistence often described in animal sign-tracking. In the present study, we evaluated to what extent VMAC would persist using a more specific extinction procedure than previous research, where instead of removing the possibility of obtaining rewards, the different discriminant stimuli that signal reward equate its value. Furthermore, we manipulated between experiments whether the high-value distractor predicted high-reward and high-punishment contingent to response accuracy (mimicking previous research; Experiment 1) or only high-reward (Experiment 2), and also explored the association of VMAC and its persistence with measures of emotional impulsivity employed in past research. Our results show that when both rewards and punishments are possible, VMAC does not extinguish after an extensive extinction stage, nor is it associated with measures of emotional impulsivity. When punishments were removed, we showed that VMAC gradually extinguished both in response times and accuracy and that the persistence of VMAC was significantly associated with positive urgency.

Here we more than double the total number of paradigms in this literature, including visual illusions assumed to rely on universal mechanisms (e.g. Gestalt shapes, Cafe wall, curvature blindness). Results reveal profound differences in visual phenomenology, with rural Namibian participants often failing to see percepts obvious to UK/US participants and vice versa. In sum, what is universal and what is culturally-constructed in human visual perception remains a wide-open area of research.",

          "abstract": "Over one million annual deaths have been attributed to bacterial antimicrobial resistance. Although antibiotics have saved countless other lives, overuse and misuse of antibiotics increases this global threat. Developing new antibiotics and retraining clinicians can be undermined by patients who pressure clinicians to prescribe unnecessary antibiotics. So we validated two low-cost, scalable interventions for improving antibiotic decisions in an online randomized control trial and a pre-registered replication (N = 985). Both first-person vignette experiments found that an infographic and text message caused intermediate to large improvements in antibiotic decisions compared to active controls — even when controlling for a dozen confounds. Notably, these educational interventions also reduced trust in a clinician who offered antibiotics for an upper respiratory infection. These data show how low-cost adjustments to existing communication systems can teach people to reduce the existential risks of antibiotic resistance and how inappropriate antibiotic prescribing can erode trust in health systems.",

While arguably central to the promotion of societal wellbeing and human flourishing, little has been done on its empirical assessment. We present a measure of love of neighbor, grounded in a broader conceptual framework concerning interpersonal love, and examine its psychometric properties using cognitive interviews and analyses from datasets from numerous countries, cultures, and contexts. We present evidence for two distinct facets: unitive and contributory neighbor love. We discuss distinctions of unitive and contributory neighbor love from compassionate love, which might be conceived of as contributory neighbor love within the context of suffering. Psychometric properties of the measure concerning consistency, reliability, internal structure, relations between indicators, and measurement invariance are presented. The measure lays the foundation for future empirical study of the distribution, causes, and consequences of love of neighbor.",

This study investigated the relationship between microstates and cardiac activity by simultaneously recording EEG and electrocardiograms from 103 healthy participants during resting state. Our analysis revealed temporal associations between specific microstates and cardiac events: microstates A, D, and E showed distinct probability of occurrence throughout the cardiac cycle, with microstate A exhibiting increased probability during R and T waves of the electrocardiogram. Furthermore, the occurrence probabilities of microstates A and E varied with the phase of low-frequency heart rate variability (LF-HRV). These findings provide evidence for the coupling between peripheral cardiac processes and central brain activity, suggesting that EEG microstate patterns reflect cardiac-related activity.",

          "abstract": "Time-series data have become ubiquitous in psychological research because it allows us to study within-person dynamics and their heterogeneity across persons. Vector autoregressive (VAR) models have become a popular choice as a first approximation of within-person dynamics. The VAR model of each person and the heterogeneity across persons can be jointly modeled using a hierarchical model that captures heterogeneity as a latent distribution. Currently, the most popular choice for this is the multilevel VAR model, which models heterogeneity across persons as quantitative variation through a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Here, we discuss an alternative, the latent class VAR model, which models heterogeneity as qualitative variation using a number of discrete clusters. While this model has been introduced before, it has not been readily accessible to researchers. We change this with this paper, in which we provide an accessible introduction to latent class VAR models; evaluate, in a simulation study, how well this model can be estimated in situations resembling applied research; introduce a new R package ClusterVAR, which provides easy-to-use functions to estimate the model; and provide a fully reproducible tutorial on modeling emotion dynamics, which walks the reader through all steps of estimating, analyzing, and interpreting latent class VAR models.",

          "abstract": "Background and Hypothesis\n\nVisual hallucinations (VH) are a core symptom of both Lewy body diseases (LBDs; e.g., Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies) and serotonergic psychedelics (SPs; e.g., psilocybin and mescaline). While these classes of VH differ in etiology, shared pathways are suggested by overlapping phenomenology and neural mechanisms. This review explores similarities and differences in VH between LBDs and SPs, focusing on phenomenology, cortical function, and serotonergic modulation.\n\nStudy Design\n\nThis narrative review synthesizes findings from neurology, cognitive neuroscience, and systems neuroscience to compare VH in LBDs and SPs. The literature includes studies with both human subjects and animal models that examine cortical activity patterns, neuromodulatory mechanisms, and VH phenomenology.\n\nStudy Results\n\nBoth LBDs and SPs exhibit distinct visual aberrations, ranging from minor metamorphopsias to complex hallucinations. Specific classes of VH in LBDs resemble those induced by SPs (e.g., illusory motion and entity encounters), suggesting shared neural mechanisms. Neuroimaging studies indicate a common pattern of hyperactive associative cortex and hypoactive sensory cortex. At the neuromodulator level, SP-induced VH involves serotonin 2A and 1A receptor (5-HT₂AR and 5-HT₁AR) modulation, while in LBDs, 5-HT₂AR upregulation correlates with increased VH, and its inhibition (e.g., with pimavanserin) reduces VH. Two shared cortical signatures are highlighted: reduced visual evoked responses and shifts toward visual excitation.\n\nConclusions\n\nExamining cortical and neuromodulatory similarities between LBD- and SP-induced VH may elucidate the link between visual degradation, excitation, and hallucinogenesis. Future research should employ real-time neuroimaging of discrete hallucinatory episodes to identify shared mechanisms and develop targeted interventions for LBD hallucinations.",

The review provides a tutorial introduction to key concepts in the predictive processing literature and maps the extent of research in this area, identifying key domains of application and the level of empirical support. A systematic search of EMBASE, Medline, PsycINFO, and SPORTDiscus databases was performed, adhering to JBI methodology and the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews. Eighteen relevant empirical studies were discovered across all domains of sport and exercise science. Despite promising evidence, the review also uncovers significant gaps, particularly in comparing predictive-processing-specific mechanisms to alternative theories and exploring the broader implications of predictive processing for skill acquisition and training interventions. Based on these findings, the review outlines recommendations for future research, calling for more targeted investigations that empirically test predictive processing predictions and an expansion of this approach to new areas of sport science.",

          "abstract": "Research into the construct of statistical learning, the ability to learn structured patterns in the environment, has been exploding in recent years. Despite the plethora of studies, critical reviews have highlighted challenges facing this area of research, including confusion about what statistical learning is, what cognitive and neural mechanisms support it, how these mechanisms map onto different laboratory tasks, and how it relates to other forms of learning, memory, and cognition. These challenges are not unique to statistical learning research but in fact are difficulties confronting the psychological sciences more broadly. In this paper, we use recent conceptual advances regarding the nature of the “theory crisis” in psychology to provide a roadmap for developing a theoretical framework that can provide meaningful and valid conceptualizations of the various phenomena that statistical learning touches upon. First, we describe three important challenges to statistical learning research: a lack of robust phenomena to constrain theories, issues with construct validity, and challenges with establishing causality. Next, we discuss each issue in relation to several research phenomena that have been examined in some detail in the statistical learning research. Finally, we offer recommendations that we believe can help address the theory crisis in statistical learning research to help move the field forward in fruitful directions.",

          "abstract": "Placebo and nocebo effects illustrate the profound influence of cognitive-affective processes on symptom perception and treatment outcomes, with the potential to significantly alter responses to medical interventions. Despite their clinical relevance, the question of how placebo and nocebo effects differ in strength and duration remains largely unexplored. In this preregistered study, we used a within-subject design in 104 healthy to investigate and directly compare the magnitude and persistence of placebo and nocebo effects on experimental pain. Effects were assessed immediately after their induction through verbal instructions and conditioning and at a one-week follow-up. Significant placebo and nocebo effects were detected on day 1 and day 8, but nocebo effects were stronger on both test days. Sustained effects after one week were primarily predicted by individuals’ experienced effects on day 1. Our findings underscore the enduring nature of placebo and nocebo effects in pain, with nocebo responses demonstrating consistently greater strength, which is consistent with an evolutionarily advantageous ‘better-safe-than-sorry’ strategy. These insights emphasise the significant impact of nocebo effects and stress the need to prioritise efforts to mitigate them in clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "We show how e-values simplify the design and the conduct of experiments.

Early stopping not only preserves resources, but also mitigates risk for participants in clinical settings. Anytime-valid tests always allow for optional continuation, that is, the extension of an experiment regardless of the motivation. For instance, if more funds become available, or if the evidence looks promising and the funding agency, a reviewer, or an editor urges the experimenter to collect more data. Analogously, a researcher can be assured that a 95% anytime-valid confidence interval will, with at least 95% chance, cover the true effect size regardless of how, or even if, data collection is stopped. We use the free and open-source software library safestats implemented in R to illustrate the practical benefits of this novel inference framework.",

          "abstract": "Background: Symptoms of social anxiety and depression often co-occur, but many questions remain about symptom-level co-occurrence and the heterogeneity of symptom presentations across individuals, as well as their emotional functioning. Method: This study used a person-oriented approach, Latent Profile Analysis (LPA), to identify distinct profiles (i.e., subgroups) in a UK adult sample (N = 222) varying in presentations of social anxiety and depressive symptoms. Further analyses examined between-profile differences in emotional functioning, including daily affect and emotion regulation. Results: Four profiles were identified: Comorbid, Dysphoric, Socially Anxious, and Low Distress, replicating the four-profile solution revealed in prior research on adolescents. The Comorbid subgroup reported the most pronounced emotional dysfunction, with higher daily negative affect, lower positive affect, and greater emotion dysregulation than the other three subgroups. The Low Distress subgroup reported the best emotional functioning. Limitations: The cross-sectional study design limits our ability to assess the stability of the identified profiles over time. Conclusion: Despite its limitations, this study sheds light on the varied ways social anxiety and depression co-occur, reinforcing the need for transdiagnostic interventions that address diverse symptom patterns and emotional functioning.",

          "authors": "Anton Karl Georg Marx; Maike Eisen",
          "abstract": "There seems to be substantial scientific, clinical, and practical interest in the act of playing and its important role in human development and everyday life - from infancy to adulthood. However, for the purpose of standardizing play situations for (experimental) research on dyadic parent-child interaction or child psychotherapy, there seems to be no appropriate theory-based and/or empirically validated framework, as of yet. The present contribution aims at closing this gap and promoting systematic and reproducible research by proposing a descriptive model to categorize and organize play situations based on their potential for subjective experiences and actions while playing. In its current version, our model entails eight categories to describe a given play situation's potential for individual and dyadic experiences and actions in a standardized way. The proposed categories can be used to either (1) rate an existing play situation (or game) on the proposed dimensions (e.g., on a defined response scale) to transparently and systematically describe its profile of potential experiences and likely actions or (2) to organize and design a future play situation in an at most standardized and reproducible way prior to playing. In conclusion, we argue that our model can be a useful and valid tool to, on the one hand, experimentally control specified play situations in an empirical study, while, on the other hand, allowing an at most authentic and naturalistic play interaction between two individuals.",

Multiple probe designs were the most prevalent study method, with frequent reliance on non-standardized measures. Reporting on theoretical frameworks was limited, and adherence to open science practices, including data sharing and ethics statement reporting, was minimal. The findings highlight the need for improved methods to synthesize prevalent single-case evidence in this field.

          "abstract": "Assortative mating – the tendency to choose partners similar to oneself – is a ubiquitous phenomenon in mate choice. Despite numerous proposed explanations, a parsimonious mechanism has been overlooked: when individuals choose mates based on heritable traits and preferences, offspring inherit a trait and the corresponding preference from each parent, creating genetic correlations that link having a trait to preferring that same trait. We evaluated this mechanism with an agent-based model simulating 100 generations where agents, with traits and preferences each uniquely determined by 40 loci, chose reproductive partners based on preferences. Genetic correlations formed between preferences and preferred traits, as well as between partner traits (i.e. assortative mating), demonstrating that heritable variation in preferences and preferred traits is sufficient to drive assortative mating. We presented a toy model here, which cannot speak to the robustness of such genetic correlations, nor the relative explanatory power of this mechanism over others.",

Previous studies on moral learning show that people learn to use the decision-making strategy that led to the best outcomes in the past. Do they learn this by constructing a mental model of what outcomes would result from using either strategy (i.e., model-based learning) or by assigning value directly to each strategy (i.e., model-free learning)? To answer this question, we adapted the two-step task to a trolley-type dilemma between following moral rules (saving a colleague) versus cost-benefit reasoning (protecting a larger group). In each of the 125 trials, participants’ choices led to either a common or a rare transition, which probabilistically led to good versus bad outcomes. Computational modeling and pre-registered analysis of behavioral data provided converging evidence that participants apply both model-based and model-free learning.",

The DDPP aims to enhance the EU’s global competitiveness and align digital transformation with European values, focusing on digital skills, infrastructure, business digitalisation, and public services. However, the 2023 and 2024 reports indicate that the EU is off track to meet its 2030 goals, with slow progress on all targets. Potential challenges stemming from a failure of the DDPP include a loss of technological competitiveness, a widening digital divide, skills polarisation, and the creation of new vulnerable groups. Reckoning with the critical state of the DDPP, President von der Leyen has tasked Henna Virkkunen, Executive Vice-President (EVP) for Tech, Sovereignty, Security and Democracy, with a review of the strategy to be carried out in 2026. Ahead of it, this research aims to kickstart a conversation on the need to substantially and comprehensively revisit the DDPP targets. It combines desk research with expert discussions to assess the effectiveness of the Digital Compass and reveals significant delays, funding issues, and an overall lack of coherence in the strategy.",

          "abstract": "Social networks shape both international migration flows and residential settlement decisions, yet few studies address the links between job-related residential networks and employment outcomes among immigrants and their children. Using Norwegian linked employer–employee administrative data with information on detailed neighborhood locations, we study how connections between neighbors are tied to workplace sorting and wages among workers of immigrant and native background. To assess the presence of residential networks, we compare workers’ observed exposure to neighbors at work against a simulated baseline of random workplace allocation within municipalities. Our findings show that immigrants are considerably more likely to show an excess workplace exposure to immigrant neighbors, particularly coethnics from the same country of origin, compared to natives living in the same neighborhood. However, working alongside immigrant neighbors is only modestly associated with lower wages among immigrants, suggesting that these networks facilitate employment but offer limited economic benefits. In contrast, children of immigrants exhibit a weaker reliance on neighborhood-based immigrant networks and show no significant wage disadvantage when working with immigrant-background neighbors. These findings highlight how residential networks concentrate immigrants in specific workplaces, while less reliance on local networks in the second generation suggests greater integration into the mainstream economy.",

Much less is known about cultural integration and political participation. Given the size of the population and the ongoing war in Ukraine, more research on Ukrainian refugees is warranted, particularly in the direction of successful integration in a context where return seems increasingly unlikely --- although dual-intent remains the official focus ---, and in areas beyond economic integration that affect well-being and intentions to return.",

          "abstract": "When researchers recruit participants for an online survey via Facebook advertisements, a \ntargeting algorithm determines which individuals receive the survey invitation. Because the \nalgorithm maximizes the number of clicks on the survey link, predominantly easy-to-reach \npopulation groups in a country or region might be reached (simple demographic targeting: \nSDT). To reduce representation bias, researchers can target selected demographic population \ngroups separately (complex demographic targeting: CDT). In this study, we evaluate whether \nCDT effectively leads to less bias in univariate, bivariate, and multivariate estimates than \nSDT. This is done by comparing socio-demographic and health-related measures of health \nsurveys recruited via Facebook with and without CDT in six African countries against \nprobability-based survey benchmarks. Independent of the targeting strategy, our results show \nthat many estimates were strongly biased, especially the univariate estimates of education and \nInternet use, whereas other estimates (e.g., HIV knowledge) were less affected. Although we \nfound minor evidence that the CDT method reduced bias in univariate estimates, bias in \nrelationship estimates stayed similar. Moreover, the study shows that univariate estimates are \ngenerally more often biased than relationship estimates and that bias is partially related to \ncoverage issues. The success of weighting in bias reduction was mixed.",

          "authors": "Max P. Jansen; Yosi Yaffe",
          "abstract": "Despite decades of research, major gaps remain in understanding the origins and societal implications of the Impostor Phenomenon (IP). Social research has addressed health implications and the role of social contexts, which is crucial given pathologizing tendencies in IP research. However, large-scale empirical evidence is rare, partly because suitable instruments are missing. This study introduces the Impostor Phenomenon Short Scale (IPSS-3) as a time-efficient IP instrument suitable for surveys covering various topics with limited assessment time. Data from 424 German and 477 Hebrew-speaking adolescents and young adults is used to evaluate the psychometric properties of the IPSS-3. Results demonstrate that the IPSS-3 is a reliable instrument ready for implementation in different fields, showing high internal consistency and strong correlations with two validation scales, namely external locus of control and self-esteem. The IPSS-3 is thus a robust tool that can facilitate new ventures in IP research from a social science perspective.",

          "abstract": "The Impostor Phenomenon (IP) represents a popular research topic among scholars in various disciplines, frequently approached through a lens of individualization and pathologization. This study explores its relevance within the educational domain and contextualizes the IP by examining its association with social group membership along the dimensions of gender, immigration origin, and socioeconomic status. Providing empirical insights into the implications of the IP for social upward mobility through educational gains, this study addresses two research questions: (1) “who is particularly affected by the IP?” and (2) “is the IP negatively associated with educational efficacy beliefs and educational aspirations?”. To investigate these questions, the study applies a sociological framework for understanding the IP from a lens of social theory and examines its social stratification drawing on data from a register-based data collection among German adolescents aged 15-18 (n=4,697). The results of linear regression and probability models for three dependent variables show that (1) the IP is positively associated with disadvantaged social group membership, whereas it is negatively associated with two drivers for educational upward mobility, namely (2) educational efficacy beliefs and (3) educational aspirations. These findings suggest that the IP can undermine opportunities for social upward mobility by reinforcing internalized notions of inadequacy and not belonging to higher educational spheres. As individuals from disadvantaged social groups are more susceptible to the IP, which is associated with lower confidence in educational abilities and reduced pursuit of higher education, the IP appears to constitute an internalized barrier to upward social mobility. These results highlight the societal role of the IP, emphasize the value of understanding it from a sociological perspective, and demonstrate the importance of analyzing it through a lens of social stratification, both within and beyond the educational domain.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the dynamics and factors affecting immigrant residential segregation in Japan between 2000 and 2020, a period marked by Japan's emergence as a global immigrant destination. Using restricted-access census microdata, I examined the segregation of the 12 largest immigrant groups to the Japanese majority and among each other. I then assessed the relationship between dissimilarity and factors affecting integration using pooled linear regressions and individual location attainment models. My findings reveal that all immigrant groups exhibit high residential segregation from the Japanese majority and notable pairwise segregation. There is a general trend of spatial assimilation that higher levels of socioeconomic factors predict less segregation, while Brazilians and Peruvians, the earliest contemporary immigrant group who arrived in Japan as ethnic descendants, demonstrate a pronounced tendency towards place stratification. These observations provide support for both spatial assimilation and place stratification theory in the Japanese context. Moreover, there is a strong trend of self-segregation among highly skilled elite, particularly Western immigrants from the Japanese majority and peer immigrants. The results provide support for this dichotomy in segregation trends, underlining the integration challenges for minority groups in global new destinations and the pronounced self-segregation among elite skilled minorities.",

          "abstract": "Objective: This study examines how the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine influenced fertility preferences among young adults in Finland. Background: Crises and periods of uncertainty often lead to declines in fertility preferences in high-income societies. However, some groups may experience an increase in fertility preferences. Method: Using a nationally representative survey conducted in August 2022 (n=1960), we analyzed self-reported changes in fertility preferences in relation to socio-demographic variables through multinomial logistic regression. Additionally, qualitative analysis was conducted on open-ended responses to identify common themes behind these changes. Results: Overall, 17.2% of respondents reported changes in their fertility preferences: 10.1% decreased them, while 7.1% increased them. Men were more likely to increase their fertility preferences in response to both crises, whereas women tended to decrease them due to the war but not the pandemic. Parents were more likely to increase their fertility preferences due to the pandemic but not the war. Unemployed individuals were less likely to change their preferences compared to employed respondents. Qualitative analysis identified two key themes: postponing childbearing due to uncertainty and increasing childbearing due to family values. Conclusion: The two recent crises in Europe had distinct effects on fertility preferences across different demographic groups. Implications: Family planning and social support policies should consider not only economic factors but also non-economic uncertainties, such as political and military instability.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the intersection of social media usage and attitudes toward gender issues, leveraging a cross-national survey dataset from six European countries (France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland, and Spain) collected in 2021. By linking digital media studies with attitudinal studies on gender, we show that extensive use of social media (Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram) is significantly associated with more regressive views on gender-related issues. The survey assesses gender issues in the labor market, LGBT rights, and the perceptions of feminists. Linear regressions reveal that intense social media usage is associated with more regressive attitudes on these issues. To validate these findings, we conduct extensive sensitivity tests, confirming the robustness of our results across diverse model specifications. This study advances scholarly debates on the role of social media in shaping sociopolitical attitudes and provides novel empirical insights into the intersection of social media use and gender-related conflicts in Europe.",

          "abstract": "The #MeToo movement has been influential across over 85 countries and has remained an active part of modern feminist movements for since its inception. Scholars have argued that media representations and constructions are an important part of feminist activism and scholarship. This study examines if and how #MeToo has structurally altered the way sexual violence is represented in news media across 47 countries through the frequency of rape myths. Drawing from feminist scholarship that have employed content and thematic analyses to identify the varieties and categories of rape myths, this study employs multilingual natural language processing methods to extend these analyses to an international scale. Drawing from recent methodological developments, GPT-4 is utilized in augmenting qualitative annotations for subsequent model fine-tuning. Bayesian Structural Time Series are subsequently applied to understand the causal impact before and after the movement took off in each country. Scholars have also theorized that countries with greater political openness should be more receptive to change demanded by social movements. We find that, in most countries, the #MeToo movement did not significantly lower the frequency of rape myths in the media, and in the countries that it did the frequency often appeared to revert back to pre-2017 levels by 2022. Political openness did not explain which countries were found to have significant change or not.",

          "abstract": "Measurements of political polarization online have so far been largely focused on visible traces accessible through platformAPIs,while neglecting invisible traces not recorded or otherwise unavailable via online channels, which can reveal key aspects of political engagement online. Our study aims to address this gap by investigating the polarization measurement bias that arises when only visible engagement is considered. Using a combined dataset that links survey responses with YouTube digital traces froma representative sample of Hungarian Internet users (N=758), we uncover disparities at both user and channel levels.\nWe find that users who visibly engage through commenting are more politically polarized. People tend to comment and subscribe to ideologically concentrated content, while viewing\nideologically diverse content. We also notice that ideologically heterogeneous channels are more likely to share viewers than subscribers or commenters. Thus, the segregation of\npolitical channels may be overstated or simplified when relying solely on public comment data. Our results suggest that research using only visible engagement may overestimate the extent of polarization and the prevalence of echo chambers online. We highlight the benefits of data donation to address measurement bias in online political communication, and contribute to the polarization literature by providing a fresh evaluation of potential biases in platform-focused research.",

The empathic emotion and the compassionate impulse have distinct properties and may be independently manipulated.  Both are influenced by a variety of social, psychological, and neurobiological factors, and can be in conflict with aggressive/defensive traits.  The empathizer considers personal and group resources and consequences in deciding on possible compassionate responses.  Relevant social factors include framing, social roles, and such other factors as geographic, and temporal distance.  Those in elite/leadership roles typically share a balance of empathic and compassionate traits that may be distinct from other members of their host societies.  Empathic imagination permits emotional investment in the non-human and inanimate.   Empathy training can be effective in raising an individual’s awareness of socially inculcated response patterns allowing for conscious reappraisal and the substitution of more prosocial responses.",

This is achieved by examining the resilience of ordinary volunteering during crises, possible spill-over between ordinary and crisis volunteering, and the persistence of crisis volunteering across the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the reception of Ukraine refugees fleeing from Russia’s invasion in 2022. Using data from random samples of Danish adults before (n2020=3,519), during (n2021=1,700) and after (n2024=1,548) the pandemic, the results show that ordinary volunteering was highly resilient to the pandemic despite a significant reduction during the crisis. A five-round panel (n=694) further shows that, while ordinary volunteers transitioned into crisis volunteering, crisis volunteering did not spill over into ordinary volunteering after the pandemic. Rather, crisis volunteers persisted engaging in crisis volunteering when Ukraine refugees arrived in 2022.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents evidence about the convergences and contrasts in globalization research across English, French, and Spanish. Performing a semantic mapping of scientific publication in three language-oriented databases (Web of Science, HAL-SHS, and SciELO) presents patterns for how globalization has been framed around distinct and shared objects in three linguistic spaces. Results show a marked contrast between research performed in English, focused on finance, global governance, and business competition; in French, stressing territorial dimensions and historical contexts; and in Spanish, stressing developmental challenges and impacts of rising trade openess. Still, convergences emerge around shared research objects like social movements, human-nature relations, and higher education. By comparing similarities and language-based traits, this study illustrates the critical role of language in scientific communication, grasping existent multiplicity in Globalization research. This comparison reveals that globalization research, rather than representing a uniform global conversation, reflects a complex interplay of local and global perspectives, where language serves not only as a medium of communication but as a crucial factor in shaping research agendas and theoretical frameworks. Our findings suggest that globalization can not be considered a mere additive or aggregative process and that linking diverse and asynchronic aspects is a critical component of reflexive takes on the process. These results emphasize that social sciences, far from being a bystander, serve as a critical mediator of globality.",

Additionally, we explore effect heterogeneities by gender and educational attainment. By using long-running survey data from the German Socio-economic Panel Study (GSOEP, 1984 – 2020, N=108,340) and estimating linear probability models with fixed-effects, we contribute substantially to previous research that has been limited by cross-sectional approaches with mixed or even contradictory results. Contrary to the popular notion that childbirth leads to higher levels of environmentalism based on legacy motives, our results suggest marginal and mostly negative effects of childbirth on environmental and climate concerns. Overall, the effects of childbirth on planetary concerns tended to be less pronounced in the first years after birth. Over time, however, these effects increased and even reversed. We found no exclusive patterns for men and women and nuances of relevance by educational attainment and item design, highlighting the complex nature of the nexus between family formation, gender, and environmentalism. Parents’ slightly reduced focus on environmental and climate challenges may reflect denial mechanisms during highly stressful times, as they prioritize immediate and novel challenges associated with parenthood, often leading to an increase in less environmentally favorable behaviors.",

We use a biopolitical framework to empirically explore how leading members of Poland’s government justified protest policing. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Poland’s PiS-led government, like others across Europe, implemented social distancing measures that curtailed the right to peaceful assembly. The government justified aggressive crowd control tactics such as kettling to “protect” society from what they perceived as illegal and unruly protestors who seek to cause indirect mass harm, e.g. spread the virus via street protesting, or cause direct harm to police officers through physical acts of protester aggression. The government argued that protesters, instead of being whom the state must keep safe from biological harm, actually threaten a vulnerable police force and other institutions. The government projected their own vulnerability to cast protesters as biological threats to the nation and, thus, as dangerously norm-breaking “others,” in order to justify surveillance of demonstrators and aggressive police tactics.",

          "abstract": "This article presents an analysis of the impact of the number of alters elicited in an ego network on the structural properties of those networks. There continues to be debate about the pros and cons of eliciting a fixed number of alters for each respondent versus allowing the respondent to list as many or few alters as they would like. This article explores a random assignment of respondents to three treatment groups – 1) a fixed number of alters set at 30, 2) a variable number of alters up to 45, and 3) a variable number of alters up to 45 with a 20 alter minimum. The results indicate that, from a non-structural perspective, all levels of emotional proximity, interaction contexts, genders, and ages are consistently sampled across the three name generators. At the structural level, the behavior of individual metrics is also largely similar. However, the most significant differences arise in the collective behavior of structural metrics—specifically, in their correlation structure, the amount of redundant information each variable provides, and the diversity and interpretability of the observed structural variability. When a name generator constrains network size, it reduces the sparsity of the correlation matrix, effectively decreasing the number of independent global variables needed to describe network structure and making these global variables less interpretable. In other words, networks constructed with a name generator that limits size tend to be more similar to each other, exhibiting less structural diversity and yielding differences that are harder to interpret. However, we discuss how these differences may simply be mathematical artifacts, without necessarily implying a clear advantage in choosing one name generator over another.",

          "abstract": "Amid growing concerns that social media algorithms amplify toxic content, platforms are experimenting with giving users more control over their content exposure. This study examines how promises of algorithmic control influence user satisfaction and content evaluation. Offering users the option to avoid toxic political content increases platform satisfaction. However, those who chose this filtering option rated identical posts as more hostile than those without choice. Respondents exposed only to positive posts also rated them as more hostile than those who saw both positive and negative ones. These findings challenge assumptions about user autonomy, showing how promises of control shape expectations and interpretations. Users offered algorithmic control may hold content to stricter standards or shift from passive consumers to active evaluators, attempting to “train” the algorithm. This suggests content curation reflects complex interactions between users and algorithms, where increased autonomy can paradoxically lead to more critical evaluations even as it improves satisfaction.",

          "authors": "Bruno Sérgio Dias Oliveira",
          "abstract": "This article orbits the promise of Sociology and presents the sociology of promises — or, more precisely, the science of promises, aimed at addressing all sociological curiosities and encompassing all that is sociological. In introducing the General Social Theory of Compromises (G-STOC), a framework designed to overcome the fragmentation of traditional social theories and address their limitations in explaining social behavior, a breakthrough is presented in eight main takeaways that are simultaneously ontological, epistemological and theoretical: (1) social coercive powers derive from actual or virtual agency; (2) virtual agency derives from promises; (3) all anger and disappointment derive from broken promises; (4) promises are always in dynamic reciprocal sets called compromises; (5) compromises are heuristic devices underlying all social relationships; (6) all social phenomena involve compromises; (7) to explain is to describe relationships and (8) sociological explanation, therefore, derives from the description of compromises and their history. The above tenets begin to outline a powerful and coherent framework and their proper appreciation is bound to have a profound impact in Social Science. Avoiding convoluted syntheses of competing theories and emphasizing the social importance of the future as well as theoretical novelty and superior heuristic power, the author advocates for clear conceptual and theoretical grounds to enable a complete and integrated explanation of social phenomena. With this innovative approach, the paper invites scholars to engage critically with G-STOC and explore its potential to unify and enhance the study of the social world, offering new insights about its complexities.",

          "authors": "Valerio Simoni",
          "abstract": "Particularly since 2012, following important changes in the country’s migratory law and the increasing salience of private entrepreneurship possibilities, a significant number of Cuban migrants started envisaging a return to Cuba. Looking at the trajectories of Cuban men that returned to the island mainly from Europe, this paper explores the moral narratives that these migrants deploy when talking about economic life in Cuba in comparison to the countries they are returning from. Such assessments are often linked to the shift in status that such migrants experienced, as they moved from menial jobs in Europe to more entrepreneurial position in Cuba, signifying for many a change from worker to owner, and from ‘trabajo’ (work) to ‘negocio’ (business). Particular attention is paid to the ways in which such shifts are expressed, the role given to the experience of having lived in Europe, and the new forms of economic subjectivity and ideals of economic life that are linked to it. The paper considers the context and climate in which such narratives emerge, relying to do so also on research participants’ own assessment of current changes and continuities in Cuba. The examination of how work and business are enacted and talked about by returnees, combined with a preliminary assessment of the responses this generates among the wider public, signals their influence on how economic life appears to be increasingly articulated and morally framed in Cuba.",

          "authors": "Gabriele Mari",
          "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEarly studies show that children might be ‘resilient’ when families navigate economic crises and related job loss. What resilience means is unclear, though, and why and from whom resilience is required has seldom been examined.\nOBJECTIVE\nI theorise children’s prosociality – helping, supporting and comforting others – as a form of transformative resilience. From a social reproduction perspective, I also consider how prosociality imbues and is influenced by caregiving relationships within families. I examine how children’s prosociality/caregiving (unpaid labour) developed in response to parents losing and regaining employment (paid labour) amid the Great Recession in Ireland.\nMETHOD\nI rely on cohort data from children’s early years to adolescence (Growing Up in Ireland, 2008-2022). I estimate growth-curve and OLS models for prosocial development and outcomes tapping into paid and unpaid labour. Associations with parental job loss are identified net of observables while outlining conditions for causal claims.\nFINDINGS\nChildren whose mothers experienced job loss are rated more prosocial than their peers from middle childhood onwards. Girls with younger siblings drive this finding. At age 13, the same group is more likely to provide regular care within the household, while their mothers scale back caregiving and reprise paid work after heightened childcare responsibilities during the crisis.\nCONTRIBUTION\nThe study contributes to debates on the formation of prosociality, the intergenerational consequences of job loss, and the household division of labour among adults and children. Findings suggest focusing on if and how families cope with a context unequally structured by (labour) markets and gender norms.",

From this perspective, the research examined how demographic changes and increased life expectancy can foster a more positive outlook on this stage of life.

Through an extensive bibliographic review, the study highlighted how negative social constructs can adversely affect the quality of life of older adults. Consequently, it emphasized the need for more effective public policies, including awareness campaigns and a critical reassessment of normative discourses, as a way to challenge stereotypes and promote inclusion and respect for diversity in aging.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the ``fit'' of models designed to predict binary outcomes has been a long-standing problem. We propose a flexible, portable, and intuitive metric for quantifying the change in accuracy between two predictive systems in the case of a binary outcome: the InterModel Vigorish (IMV). The IMV is based on an analogy to weighted coins, well-characterized physical systems with tractable probabilities. The IMV is always a statement about the change in fit relative to some baseline model---which can be as simple as the prevalence---whereas other metrics are stand-alone measures that need to be further manipulated to yield indices related to differences in fit across models. Moreover, the IMV is consistently interpretable independent of baseline prevalence. We contrast this metric with alternatives in numerous simulations. The IMV is more sensitive to estimation error than many alternatives and also shows distinctive sensitivity to prevalence. We then showcase its flexibility across examples spanning the social, biomedical, and physical sciences. We also demonstrate how it can be used to provide straightforward interpretation of logistic regression coefficients. The IMV allows for precise answers to questions about changes in model fit in a variety of settings in a manner that will be useful for furthering research with binary outcomes.",

          "authors": "Sonja Ruottunen",
          "abstract": "This article examines the wellbeing implications of activation policies, focusing on the lived experiences of long-term unemployed jobseekers with public employment services. Using a phenomenological approach and the theory of sustainable wellbeing as a framework, the article explores how activation services function as either need satisfiers or barriers across four well-being dimensions: having, loving, doing, and being. Drawing on 24 individual and 4 focus group interviews in the city of Espoo in Finland, the findings highlight the potential of group-form services enhance wellbeing, particularly in the doing dimension through providing meaningful activity and fostering a sense of autonomy and capability. At best, providing meaningful activity could lead to improvements in the being dimension of wellbeing, such as improved self-image and functional ability, creating a self-reinforcing circle of wellbeing. However, to offer successful need satisfiers, group form services had to also support the loving dimension by offering experiences of social relatedness. Additionally, the interviewees lived experiences highlight conditionality as a need barrier, as jobseekers may prioritize maintaining basic material needs over engagement, fearing benefit loss. Ultimately, the article argues for a holistic approach to welfare policy design, considering the interplay of different wellbeing needs to create more inclusive support structures.",

          "abstract": "Immigrants to high-income countries often face considerable and persistent labor market difficulties upon arrival, while their native-born children typically experience economic progress. However, little is known about the degree to which these immigrant–native earnings differences stem from unequal pay when doing the same work for the same employer versus labor market processes that sort immigrants into lower-paid jobs. Using linked employer–employee data on 13.4 million workers from nine European and North American countries, we find that the segregation of immigrant-background workers in lower-paying jobs accounts for about four-fifths of immigrant–native earnings differences. Although within-job pay inequality remains consequential for immigrants in several countries, our results demonstrate that lack of access to higher-paying jobs is the primary driver of the immigrant–native pay gap across a range of highly diverse institutional and demographic host-country contexts. These findings highlight the importance of policies aimed at reducing between-job segregation, such as language, job training, and job search assistance programs; improving access to domestic education; recognizing foreign qualifications; and settlement programs aimed at enhancing access to job-relevant information and networks. Policies targeting employer bias in hiring and promotion decisions are also likely of high relevance, whereas measures aimed at ensuring equal pay for equal work may have more limited potential for further progress in closing the immigrant–native pay gap.",

          "abstract": "Sentencing research is rarely cross-jurisdictional. More problematically, most quantitative sentencing research is based on a limited number of American jurisdictions where court data is available. As a result, it is difficult to assess the extent to which key findings from the sentencing literature apply universally. We build on the recent growth of sentencing research outside the US to explore the external validity of studies reporting the conditional association of offenders’ race and gender with sentence length. To do so, we conduct two multi-level meta-analyses, distinguishing the proportion of between-study heterogeneity attributable to differences at the study and jurisdiction levels. Our findings reveal that while race disparities in sentencing are statistically significant, they are minimal in magnitude (a 3% penalty for racial minorities) and remarkably consistent across jurisdictions. In contrast, gender disparities are more pronounced (a 13% penalty against men) but highly variable, with some jurisdictions showing parity. Both analyses uncover substantial variability due to sample and modelling choices, highlighting the limited generalisability of existing sentencing research. We urge caution in interpreting findings from single studies on sentencing disparities and advocate for the pre-registration of analytical strategies to mitigate researcher bias.",

          "abstract": "In the 1940s, almost 1.5 million african americans moved from the South to the North of the United States. Previous literature on the Great Migration has mostly focused on migrant outcomes and local effects in the North. This paper studies the impact of the Great Migration for those who stayed in the South. It employs linked, full-count census data for 1940 and 1950 as well as World War Two veteran records. Leveraging preexisting migrant networks and variation in war mobilization rates in the North, it identifies exogenous variation in out-migration from the South. It finds that a 10 percentage point increase in out-migration – the average rate in the 1940s – is associated with a 0.63 percentage point increase in a county’s income growth and a 0.72 years increase in its population’s educational attainment. Potential mechanisms include reductions in unemployment and farm mechanization. Taken together, these effects suggest the Great Migration led to economic convergence between the South and the North of the United States.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the rapid growth of China’s science and technology (S&amp;T) sector within the broader context of higher education, focusing on the often-overlooked role of Hong Kong in this transformation. While conventional explanations emphasize China’s relationship with the United States, this study argues that Hong Kong has played a crucial, yet underappreciated, role in advancing China’s higher education and S&amp;T capabilities. Despite its reputation as a finance-driven city, Hong Kong has developed a robust academic and scientific community that fostered close collaborations with mainland institutions. In the 1990s, as Hong Kong’s research doctoral programs were gaining momentum, mainland students sought high-quality advanced training, and members of the overseas Chinese academic diaspora returned to join Hong Kong universities. This cross-border collaboration thrived despite cultural and ideological differences, combining the mainland’s motivated talent pool with Hong Kong’s free academic environment. Using a comprehensive dataset from the Web of Science, institutional archives, university leader biographies, and PhD dissertation records from Hong Kong’s top universities, this paper provides both quantitative and qualitative analyses of the historical collaboration between Hong Kong and mainland China. The findings reveal that this relationship was evolutionary, initiated by forward-thinking educators long before formal mechanisms were in place, and was instrumental in China’s rise to global prominence in higher education and S&amp;T. By revisiting this underexplored dimension of China’s educational development, this paper offers a new understanding of the forces behind the country’s remarkable achievements in higher education and scientific research.",

          "abstract": "Do more years of schooling cause higher lifetime earnings? Social scientists have long sought to determine the economic returns to schooling. Genotyped data presents a new opportunity to address possible bias from unobserved confounding by using genetic variants related to education, randomly assigned within families at conception, as instrumental variables (Mendelian randomization (MR)). We combine this approach with comprehensive Norwegian population-wide registry data and genotyped data from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). We employ three identification strategies for triangulation. First, we use ordinary least squares (OLS) with covariate-adjustment (N=1,260,514). Second, we apply family-based sibling (N=970,440) and twin (N=5,852) designs. Third, we conduct MR (N=110,049) and sibling MR (N=18,700). OLS implies returns of 5.9% (95% CI=5.8-6.1; NOK 34,618 ≈ USD 3,606) per additional year of schooling, siblings 5.3% (5.2-5.4), monozygotic twins 3.2% (1.9-4.6), MR 8.0% (7.1-9.0) and sibling MR 6.3% (1.5-11.6), with similar estimates from pleiotropy-robust MR. Sensitivity analyses support assumptions underlying MR. We found positive returns of similar magnitude across our designs with different non-overlapping assumptions, and all estimates exceeded opportunity costs as proxied by the market interest rate. Our study demonstrates how genetically informed designs can be used to investigate hard-to-answer causal questions in the social sciences.",

Analyzing two decades of U.S. data, we find that moving from the 25th to the 75th percentile of industry-level robot adoption reduces the within-occupation wage inequality by 16% and increases the between-occupation inequality by 7% of their respective standard deviations. These results are robust to confounding factors, different inequality measures, and instrumental variables. Our evidence shows that robots compress within-occupation wage inequality by lowering wages at the top of the distribution while increasing between-occupation inequality by impacting the middle of the distribution. We show that these findings are consistent with a standard wage-posting model incorporating endogenous robot adoption. Overall, our results suggest that robots exacerbate wage polarization while reducing the rents of the highest-paid workers in the occupations most vulnerable to automation.",

          "abstract": "The energy transition has driven the rapid expansion of associated technologies, such as solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicles. Although promoted as clean and renewable, these technologies, due to their intrinsic characteristics, rely heavily on minerals for their manufacturing - many of which have recently been classified as critical. This article examines the impact of the significant increase in demand for these minerals. Using the International Renewable Energy Agency’s definition of critical minerals - which includes cobalt, nickel, copper, lithium, and rare earth elements - we conducted extensive data collection, systematization, and analysis on a global scale to identify the main producing countries and the contexts surrounding their extraction. The results reinforce a historical pattern in which most critical minerals for the energy transition originate from Global South nations, predominantly in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In countries where environmental, social, and economic regulations are often more flexible, the profitability of large international corporations is favored. Furthermore, our findings reveal that, in many cases, the extraction of these minerals is linked to severe social, environmental, and economic impacts, ranging from extreme pollution and worker contamination by toxic metals to the financing of militias associated with authoritarian military regimes. These issues, often overlooked in dominant energy transition narratives, deserve greater attention and reflection from both the scientific community and society at large.",

Specifically, the paper argues that the right not to vote should be interpreted as an exclusionary permission - i.e. as a permission to not act on the reasons that in principle favour voting. And the paper justifies that permission by appealing to citizens fundamental moral claim to be autonomous agents. In developing this argument, the paper improves upon existing arguments for the right not to vote and helps the general public figure out what the legitimate place of non-voting is in a democratic society.",

          "title": "The Role of Polygenic Indices in Inequality of Opportunity",
          "authors": "Michael Grätz; Sonia Petrini",
          "abstract": "Equality of opportunity is a principle of social justice, although there are different conceptions of it. We distinguish between liberal and radical equality of opportunity. Both conceptions consider unfair inequalities in life chances that result from ascribed characteristics such as social origin, migration background, and sex. However, they differ in that liberal equality of opportunity considers it fair when innate abilities affect life chances. Conversely, radical equality of opportunity places innate abilities in the category of morally arbitrary factors that do not provide a fair basis for inequalities in life chances. We use polygenic indices (PGIs) to better disentangle the role of innate abilities from the roles of ascribed characteristics and individual choices. We compare this approach to using measures of skills observed later in life. We apply this approach to two survey datasets, (1) the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) and (2) the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP). According to our results, radical inequality of opportunity is considerably larger than liberal inequality of opportunity, especially for education. Measuring innate abilities using PGIs leads to very similar conclusions as using skills measured later in life. However, the differences between liberal and radical inequality of opportunity are smaller using PGIs than using measures of observed skills.",

          "title": "The Minerals Energy Complex in South Africa: an Empirical Debunking",
          "authors": "Niall Reddy",
          "abstract": "A hugely influential framework in South African political economy holds that the country has been dominated for the better part of a century by a Minerals Energy Complex (MEC) comprising powerful firms and state agencies involved in mining and a range of downstream industries. The MEC is said to act as a 'system of accumulation' determining patterns of accumulation across the economy. This paper argues that MEC theories rest on hollow empirical foundations. It shows, firstly, that the apparent size, stability and integration of MEC sectors in national accounting data are a statistical artifact of the overly expansive and ad hoc way in which the MEC has been defined. Secondly, it shows that the political-institutional conditions for an MEC system of accumulation no longer exist, if they ever did. Conglomerates related to MEC sectors once possessed the ability to shape economy-wide accumulation dynamics but it's unclear if their interests were ever geared towards the self-reproduction of core sectors at the expense of diversification. With liberalization those capacities were dismantled. MEC firms never regained their position at the top of the corporate hierarchy and in fact there is no clear evidence of them even acting as coherent fraction of capital. Far from favoring the MEC, the post-Apartheid state meekly pursued diversification but was stymied in this by it's own lack of capacity. This left commodity dependence intact -- not as a result of the MEC, but of state enfeeblement induced first by neoliberalism and then by state capture. The paper closes by showing how assumptions of corporate hegemony -- latently embedded in MEC theories -- leave us unable to explain major trends in South African political economy like state capture.",

          "abstract": "Grandparental childcare is an important form of social support, which may improve the well-being of grandchildren, parents, and grandparents themselves. Prior studies have detected that older adults who provide support to one party are more likely to offer help and care to family and other close ones; however, there is a lack of research on multitasking that examines whether helping others is associated with grandparental childcare. We used data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe from 27 countries to examine whether (i) informal caregiving (i.e., informal, unpaid care provided in the same household) and (ii) informal support (i.e., informal, unpaid support provided to someone outside the household) are associated with grandparental childcare. We found that informal caregiving in the same household was associated with neither an increase nor a decrease in grandparental childcare. However, informal support given to someone outside the household was associated with increased grandparental childcare. These findings are discussed in relation to resource competition in a family, grandparental role extension, and grandparental role overload.",

          "authors": "Ilari Ilmakunnas; Susanna Sten-Gahmberg; Timopekka Hakola",
          "abstract": "In 2017, Finland introduced a partial old-age pension scheme, allowing individuals to claim either 25 or 50 percent of their old-age pension after turning 61, irrespective of their employment status. Claiming a partial pension before the statutory retirement age results in a permanent reduction of the full old-age pension. Due to the rapid rise in consumer prices in 2022, individuals who claimed their pension before the end of 2022 benefited from a three-percentage points higher index adjustment in 2023, resulting in a permanently higher pension compared to those who claimed their pension in early 2023. In this study, we assess the causal effect of the financial incentive arising from the exceptional index adjustment on pension take-up using regression discontinuity design and full population register data. We also analyse differences in responses by socioeconomic status and gender. The extraordinary pension index adjustment increased the probability of claiming the partial old-age pension in the first month after becoming eligible for it by around 8 percentage points, or around 80 per cent. The effect is explained by individuals claiming a pension sooner than they would have in the absence of the exceptional index adjustment. Individuals with a higher pension accrual, higher earnings, or with upper tertiary education were more likely than others to respond to the index adjustment.",

          "abstract": "Sentencing research is rarely cross-jurisdictional. More problematically, most quantitative sentencing research is based on a limited number of American jurisdictions where court data is available. As a result, it is difficult to assess the extent to which key findings from the sentencing literature apply universally. We build on the recent growth of sentencing research outside the US to explore the external validity of studies reporting the conditional association of offenders’ race and gender with sentence length. To do so, we conduct two multi-level meta-analyses, distinguishing the proportion of between-study heterogeneity attributable to differences at the study and jurisdiction levels. Our findings reveal that while race disparities in sentencing are statistically significant, they are minimal in magnitude (a 3% penalty for racial minorities) and remarkably consistent across jurisdictions. In contrast, gender disparities are more pronounced (a 13% penalty against men) but highly variable, with some jurisdictions showing parity. Both analyses uncover substantial variability due to sample and modelling choices, highlighting the limited generalisability of existing sentencing research. We urge caution in interpreting findings from single studies on sentencing disparities and advocate for the pre-registration of analytical strategies to mitigate researcher bias.",

          "abstract": "Labor unions have many well-documented effects on economic outcomes that are plausibly related to family formation. I study the impact of unionization on fertility using evidence from the largest expansion of unionism in American history: the enactment of the 1935 National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). I introduce new estimates of local union membership and exploit variation in exposure to the NLRA shock to estimate the place level effect of union growth on fertility outcomes. Unionization has positive effects on birth rates and completed fertility, and can account for approximately 20% of overall fertility increases during the Baby Boom. Effects are driven primarily by wage growth, protection against adverse labor market shocks, and impacts on female labor force participation.",

A special focus is put on the description of the generative mechanisms using simple models that can be used online and the distinction of mechanisms of type I (which govern the behavior of individuals and institutions) and type II (which govern the emergence of new systemic properties). Finally, five extensions of the simple models are discussed, which demonstrate different research directions that can be taken in exploring and developing social theory.",
