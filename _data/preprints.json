          "title": "Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation with Instrumental Variable Methods",
          "authors": "Amir Aamodt Kazemi; Joseph Sexton; Inge Christoffer Olsen",
          "abstract": "Instrumental variable (IV) methods are widely used to address unmeasured confounding in observational studies but typically estimate the local average treatment effect (LATE) for compliers. If there exist effect modifying variables that also affect the choice of treatment, the LATE may have limited clinical relevance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework for estimating the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) for a categorical treatment variable in the presence of both observed confounding and effect-modifying variables in addition to valid IVs. Building on recent developments in data fusion between randomized trial and observational data, we combine IV estimators with estimators based on covariate adjustment. By making parametric assumptions about the residual unobserved confounding effect, we obtain a consistent estimator of the CATE with relatively high efficiency. In a simulation study with nonlinear effect modification and unobserved confounding, we show that our estimator outperforms competing IV and covariate-adjusted estimators in terms of mean squared error. We further illustrate the applicability of the method, utilizing it to compare tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors as the first line biologic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis conditional on age. The analysis identifies modest age-related heterogeneity in treatment effects and provides population-relevant clinically interpretable estimates. This work provides a general framework for combining instrumental and confounding information to estimate individualized causal effects when treatment effects are heterogeneous and there are more than two treatment alternatives.",

          "authors": "Lex Bouter",
          "abstract": "Fiction books on aspects of research integrity can be a valuable supplement to normative guidelines on how research should be done. They provide concrete examples of violations of the laws, regulations and codes of conduct that make the norms of scientific research explicit. Their narratives sketch fictional cases of research misconduct and questionable research practices, and the circumstances under which they can occur. Novels can realistically depict the dilemmas scholars need to navigate in an accessible way that readers can relate to both intellectually and emotionally. This may help them to reflect on what a good researcher is and what academic scholars can do to stay close to that ideal. A total of 35 novels dealing with research integrity themes from the last 100 years is reviewed, with special attention to the research integrity topics, its drivers, and its consequences. These novels may be used in research integrity training as a method to evoke individual reflection or to inspire group discussion.",

          "title": "The Hidden Cost of Control: Reappraisal Brings Short-Term Benefits but Hinders Adaptation to Unexpected Emotional Reminders",
          "authors": "David Brian Rompilla; Connor Bazar; Savannah Dod; Valerie Lu; Takashi Yamauchi",
          "abstract": "Cognitive reappraisal is widely viewed as adaptive. Yet this control-based emotion regulation may carry hidden costs when individuals encounter personally meaningful reminders of past adversity. The present study examined these tradeoffs in a naturally occurring subsample of undergraduates with a history of parental divorce. Within a larger experiment, participants viewed sad film clips, including an unexpected divorce-relevant reminder, completed a movement-based Stroop task, and later reported the extent to which the reminder reactivated negative feelings from their own experience. As predicted, instructed reappraisal conferred short-term functional benefits on the Stroop task. However, at a longer timescale, individuals who reported habitually relying more heavily on reappraisal showed evidence of preserved reminder-evoked distress. In contrast, individuals higher in habitual acceptance showed a more normative pattern, such that those with divorces further in the past reported faint to no distress in response to the reminders. Together, these findings point to a central tradeoff in emotion regulation: reappraisal helps people maintain composure in the moment, yet repeated reliance on it keeps emotional echoes of past adversity alive. The divergent effects of these two emotion regulation strategies—reappraisal and acceptance—are discussed through cybernetic and comparator-based models of emotion regulation, where cognitive appraisal acts as a feedback process involving reference signals, error monitoring, and corrective adjustments while acceptance involves release of control.",

          "abstract": "Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) allows researchers and clinicians to evaluate variations in acute pain and thermosensation within and across individuals. However, it is unclear how experimental factors, such as thermode type and stimulation duration, affect pain measurements. We compared three types of thermodes at two stimulus durations to assess potential impacts on QST outcomes.\n\nAcross two experiments, a total of 83 (45 and 38 respectively) healthy volunteers each completed two QST tasks that varied in thermode type (ATS, CHEPS or T03) and/or stimulus duration (8s or 3s), with order counterbalanced across participants. In each task, heat was applied to 8 sites on the left volar forearm for three runs (24 trials in total) and temperatures were selected through an adaptive staircase calibration procedure. Pain threshold, tolerance, and the strength of the correlation between stimulus temperature and pain ratings (r²) were estimated using linear regression. \n\nResults indicate that briefer stimuli were associated with higher pain tolerance (t = -3.28, p = 0.018), while there was no effect of duration on threshold or temperature-rating correlation. Thermode type influenced pain tolerance in short (3s) (t = -3.10, p = 0.01) but not long (8s) durations, such that on 3s trials, tolerance was higher with the smaller surface thermode (T03) compared to the larger surface thermode (CHEPS), consistent with spatial summation. No sex differences were found. These results demonstrate that suprathreshold pain tolerance, but not threshold, is sensitive to stimulus duration and thermode type. These findings also indicate the importance of methodological standardization in QST and the careful selection of suprathreshold pain stimuli in experiment design.",

          "authors": "Răzvan Jurchiș; Andrei Preda",
          "abstract": "Implicit statistical learning (ISL) is a fundamental cognitive process through which we extract regularities from environmental stimuli. While ISL has several characteristics of unconscious processing (e.g., it operates unintentionally, produces subjectively unconscious knowledge), participants in ISL experiments always report some fragmentary conscious knowledge. Thus, the notion that ISL is truly an unconscious process has been the subject of perpetual debates. In the present study, we challenge the assumption that these conscious reports reflect direct access to the acquired knowledge. Building on predictions from key theories of consciousness and suggestive evidence in the literature, we tested the hypothesis that participants’ conscious reports in ISL reflect a post hoc conscious model of their non-conscious knowledge. Across two artificial grammar learning experiments, participants were exposed to sequences of stimuli (letters, faces, or body movements in VR) generated by different artificial grammars. In a subsequent test, they decided whether novel strings were grammatical or not and reported their subjective awareness trial-by-trial. In both experiments, we found extreme Bayesian evidence that repetitions embedded in the testing strings made participants more aware of the knowledge driving their grammaticality decisions, above and beyond their influence on responses or accuracy. This suggests that, lacking access to the true basis of their decisions, participants attributed their responses to the most salient feature available—the repetitions. Thus, we find evidence that our conscious experience can misrepresent not only the external world but also our own unconsciously learned representations.",

          "abstract": "Likelihood-based methods such as marginal maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) are widely used for estimating item response theory (IRT) models and perform well in large samples. In small samples, however, these approaches may yield unstable estimates due to insufficient information in the likelihood, unless strong prior distributions are imposed. We address this problem by turning to the fundamentals of estimation via decision theory, showing that small-sample estimation can be viewed as an ill-posed decision problem in the sense that the decision function is sensitive to small changes in the data and, therefore, may not be continuous. We discuss how such ill-posed decision problems—both in IRT estimation and more broadly—can be regularized using neural network (NN)-based approaches that build a continuous map from observations into parameters. We formalize this approach within a general framework termed regularized decision theory and apply it to IRT models. Focusing on the 3PL, we study its properties via simulations.",

          "abstract": "We often form beliefs based on information provided by others, but these sources can be biased, distorting our beliefs and decisions. Here, we examine whether individuals can detect biased sources and mitigate their influence. Participants completed a decision-making task where outcome feedback was provided by either unbiased or biased sources. Using a reinforcement learning framework, we show that participants successfully detected source biases and used this knowledge to correct biased feedback. However, these corrections were incomplete, allowing residual biases to continue shaping beliefs and decisions. Moreover, following exposure to biased sources, participants systematically misperceived unbiased sources as biased.  We demonstrate how these effects can arise from a “dual-learning” process in which both beliefs about source-biases and value-estimates of choice options are updated to minimize discrepancies between outcome feedback and expectations. Our findings highlight the challenge of forming accurate beliefs and offer mechanistic insights regarding how biased environments bias our beliefs.",

          "authors": "Raphael Schuster; Constantin Yves Plessen; Per Carlbring; Andreas Walther",
          "abstract": "The rapid evolution of Large Language Models has accelerated the development of agentic AI systems capable of pursuing autonomous goals, creating an urgent need for structural frameworks in psychiatry and psychotherapy. While existing classifications often draw parallels to autonomous driving, this paper argues that the mental health domain requires a distinct theoretical grounding due to specific differences in error tolerance, fat-tail risks (low-probability, high-consequence events), and the reliance on common therapeutic factors. To guide clinicians and researchers through these developments, we propose a five-step taxonomy for language-based AI systems, differentiating technical functionality from clinical effectiveness. The taxonomy progresses from Level 1 (Knowledge Level), where systems perform static benchmark tasks; to Level 2 (Elementary Level), characterized by dynamic engagement in specific therapeutic micro-skills; and Level 3 (Integration Level), where systems achieve case-level conceptualization suitable for blended therapy under human oversight. Level 4 (Saturation Level) describes human-in-the-loop systems capable of autonomous function with minimal supervision, while Level 5 (Mastery) represents fully autonomous agents that theoretically outperform human error rates across the entire care pathway. We conclude by discussing the necessity of shifting benchmarking from static knowledge tests to dynamic evaluations of therapeutic capabilities to safely navigate the transition toward autonomous care.",

          "abstract": "Background: Austria lacks consensus on psychotherapy treatment need, with published estimates\nvarying widely. This uncertainty stems from unavailable data and the absence of routine monitoring,\nimpeding evidence-based planning.\nObjective: To synthesize existing estimates of psychotherapy treatment need in Austria, compare\nthem against capacity estimates, and quantify the treatment gap.\nMethods: We systematically searched for estimates of psychotherapy need (1990–2025). Thirteen\nestimates from nine sources were analyzed: (1) population-based estimates derived from surveys or\nclinical assessments (2.1–15.9%), and (2) prevalence-based models combining mental disorder rates\nwith treatment readiness scenarios (30%, 40%, 50%). Each estimate was rated on three dimensions\nreflecting methodological rigor and contextual relevance. Need estimates were compared against\npublished capacity data for insurance-funded and total treatment provision.\nResults: Treatment need estimates ranged from 2.1% to 19.1% of the population (192,738 to\n1,752,998 persons). Quality-weighted averaging yielded 11.3% (1,040,148 persons); high-quality\nestimates (score ≥8) converged on 11.4–19%.\nInsurance-funded capacity covers 1–2.6% of the population; total capacity including self-funded\ntreatment reaches 4–8.9%. The insurance-funded treatment gap is 77–91% (801,520–948,368\npersons lacking access); the total capacity gap is 21–65%. Moreover, only approximately 1% of the\npopulation receives fully-funded psychotherapy meeting conventional definitions of adequate\ntreatment.\nConclusions: Austria’s psychotherapy treatment gap is substantial to severe under all scenarios.\nCurrent insurance-funded capacity meets less than one-third of estimated need, disproportionately\naffecting those unable to pay out of pocket. Addressing this gap requires expansion of publicly\nfunded services, stepped-care models including digital interventions, and routine monitoring\nsystems.",

          "authors": "Jessica Helmer; Nikolay Petrov; Sophie Ma Zhu; Ezra Karger; Mark Himmelstein",
          "abstract": "Forecasting skill is often measured by the average error between forecasters’ predictions and the ground truth, but the inherent uncertainty in event outcomes adds an additional layer of measurement error onto skill estimation. Intersubjective measures offer an alternative approach to skill measurement: comparing forecasters’ predictions to those of their peers, typically to aggregated forecasts from groups of peers. A key advantage of this approach is that forecasts can be scored in real time, without having to wait for the ground truth outcome to be realized. However, it has another more subtle advantage as well: aggregate predictions can be less noisy than ground truth outcomes, leading to a potential reduction in this additional\nmeasurement error. In a simulation study, we demonstrate conditions under which crowd aggregates provide a more reliable indicator of the optimal forecast for a given event than a single realized ground truth outcome, leading to skill measurement with reduced measurement error. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of intersubjective methods in a real-world forecasting study in which 894 participants made both forecasts and metapredictions, i.e., predictions of what others might forecast. As in our simulation, intersubjective measures capture forecasting ability more efficiently than do ground-truth scores, demonstrating their usefulness for identifying high-performing forecasters.",

          "abstract": "Immersive virtual reality (VR) enables controlled tests of how emotional context distorts subjective time, yet findings remain mixed. Fifty-seven adults explored three five-minute VR environments (tranquil garden, neutral room, threatening sewer) while eye tracking recorded pupil diameter. Baseline stress was assessed before VR exposure. After each environment, participants estimated elapsed time and rated mood, calmness, and arousal. Repeated-measures ANCOVA (baseline stress as covariate) and linear mixed-effects models converged on a valence gradient: garden intervals were overestimated, sewer intervals underestimated, and neutral estimates were intermediate. Pupil diameter showed the complementary pattern (sewer &gt; garden &gt; neutral) and covaried with the magnitude of temporal distortion. Baseline stress did not predict time estimates and did not moderate valence effects. Results indicate that affectively distinct VR contexts reliably shift perceived time and elicit convergent physiological and self-report responses. These findings inform emotion-aware design of immersive experiences and digital-wellbeing safeguards that support safe, sustained immersion.",

A secondary objective was to investigate whether prolonged typing influences the intention to engage in physical activity.\nBackground\nTyping is an integral part of daily life, at home and at work. Because prolonged engagement in physical or cognitive activities can induce fatigue—characterized by objective and/or subjective manifestations—it is reasonable to assume that typing may induce fatigue.\nMethod\nThirty healthy adults (27±5 y.o., 21 females) participated in this within-subjects crossover pre-post design study. Participants completed 90-min of typing or documentary watching. Mental fatigue, effort, motivation, boredom, and perceived workload were assessed during each condition. Cognitive performance, typing performance, maximal voluntary force, and physical activity intention were measured before and after each task. Participants then completed a psychomotor task. \nResults\nTyping induced greater fatigue than documentary watching (p=.003, η2p=.172), without impairing physical or cognitive performance. In contrast, psychomotor performance was reduced after typing (p=.018, d=0.457) but not after documentary watching. Regardless of condition, physical activity intention decreased after the tasks (p&lt;.001, η2p=.469).\nConclusion\nProlonged typing induces a state of fatigue that selectively impairs psychomotor performance. Both typing and documentary watching reduced physical activity intentions, suggesting that prolonged screen-based sedentary activities may negatively influence physical activity intentions.\nApplication\nThe results highlight the need to address prolonged screen-based sedentary activities in occupational settings. Regular active breaks may help limit fatigue-related psychomotor declines and reduction in physical activity intentions.",

          "abstract": "Social touch is crucial for understanding others and emotional communication. The perception of social touch can be experienced directly on the skin but also vicariously through the observation of touch. However, the pleasantness derived from social touch is not uniform; it is shaped by interindividual differences, including state factors (e.g. depression, loneliness, and anxiety) and traits factors (e.g. anhedonia, touch attitude and experience, and empathy). Despite their relevance, the specific effects of these factors on vicarious social touch perception remain scarce and understudied.\nTo bridge this gap, a behavioural experiment was conducted using the Socio-tactile picture database (SoTact) which includes the target condition: social touch, and two control conditions: social no-touch and non-social touch. Forty-four participants rated the pleasantness of these stimuli while we examined the influence of interindividual differences, assessed via questionnaires.\nAmong state factors, higher anxiety levels predicted reduced pleasantness of social touch stimuli. Conversely, trait factors, specifically anhedonia and touch attitudes, significantly predicted pleasantness ratings for both social touch and social no-touch conditions. Moreover, using a mediation analysis, our study also showed that touch attitudes as a measurement of stable trait can partially explain how state of anxiety modifies touch perception. These findings underscore the critical role of interindividual traits and states in shaping vicarious social touch perception, offering insights for future research on emotion and social cognition.",

          "authors": "Desmond Jamal Spann; John G. Kerns",
          "abstract": "Schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSD) are often lifelong with chronic functional impairment. Negative symptoms are strongly related to functional impairment but are poorly treated. A potentially important but neglected aspect of negative symptoms is how they can be influenced by and reflect enduring interaction patterns with the environment. Consistent with this, the current paper presents a model for how one environmental factor, racial stress, influences negative symptoms in Black Americans, a group with increased rates of SSD. Following Strauss1, we use Bronfenbrenner’s bioecological model to examine how racial stress occurring across multiple environmental levels can affect negative symptoms. We propose that one critical factor is that racial stress can help create negative self-beliefs. Following Beck’s Generic Cognitive Model, these negative self-beliefs can then affect motivation, goal-directed behavior, and social withdrawal. Importantly, we also propose that a strong racial identity can act as a buffer and prevent the development of negative self-beliefs. This model proposes a novel environmental pathway that might increase negative symptoms in Black Americans and identifies a potentially critical way that future treatment and prevention efforts might decrease or stop the onset of negative symptoms in SSD. By further illustrating how environmental factors can increase negative symptoms, our model helps further lay the groundwork for how other environmental models could help identify precision medicine approaches to treating and preventing negative symptoms in SSD.",

          "abstract": "Confidence, the “feeling of knowing” that accompanies every cognitive process, plays a critical role in human reinforcement learning; yet its computational bases in learning scenarios have only recently begun to be studied. Prior work has distinguished between value confidence (certainty in value estimates) and decision confidence (certainty that a choice is correct), but how these two forms of confidence are computed and interact has not been directly tested. Here we combine two experiments and previously published datasets to test competing computational hypotheses. We find that value confidence is best explained by a Bayesian computation reflecting the precision of value estimates, and that it adaptively guides behaviour by reducing exploration and promoting exploitation as certainty increases. In contrast, decision confidence departs from Bayesian predictions, especially on errors. A hybrid model integrating Bayesian probability with the precision of the decision variable better accounts for decision confidence. Moreover, the relative weights assigned to these two sources of information characterize individual differences in confidence reporting and, in addition, they are predictive of task and metacognitive performance, where the more Bayesian the subject, the higher the performance. Together, these results provide a unified computational mechanism through which distinct forms of confidence shape learning and choices in uncertain environments.",

What is the structure of these so-called pragmatic abilities? We applied a dimensionality reduction approach to a large behavioral dataset (776 participants, each completing an 8-hour battery of diverse non-literal comprehension tasks). By examining covariation in performance across tasks, we identified three interpretable components of pragmatic language use: adherence to social conventions, extracting meaning from intonation, and causal reasoning based on world knowledge. Thus, pragmatic language use is relatively low-dimensional cognitively, and its distinct components may a) draw on dissociable neural substrates, b) exhibit distinct developmental trajectories and differential susceptibility to genetic brain disorders, and c) be variably challenging for artificial intelligence systems.",

          "authors": "Shane McLoughlin",
          "abstract": "Character education research is often constrained by blunt methodological tools. Surveys capture breadth without depth; case studies offer richness but lack replicability; and randomised controlled trials (RCTs), though indispensable at the policy level, are costly, disruptive, and ill-suited to everyday practice with individual pupils. More troublingly, often invite an ergodic fallacy: assuming that what works on average must work for each individual. In reality, interventions that deliver modest positive effect sizes typically conceal a mix of no effects, negative effects, and only some benefits. This leaves teachers, mentors, and coaches without rigorous tools to evaluate what matters most: whether an intervention works here, now, for this pupil. This paper argues that single-subject designs (SSDs) offer a neglected but transformative solution. SSDs involve repeated measurement in which individuals serve as their own controls, allowing stronger causal inference at the individual level compared with RCT data. They democratise research by enabling practitioners to capture and publish the wisdom of context-sensitive practice without the machinery of large trials. Through worked examples drawn from moral and character education, this tutorial demonstrates why and how to design, measure, and analyse SSDs to rigorous standards. SSDs can reshape the field into a cumulative, personalised science that empowers practitioners and complements large-scale studies.",

          "abstract": "In this paper we ask and try to answer seven questions, some bigger than others, on perceiving and understanding minds in others: 1) Do humans, animals, artificial agents have minds? Objectively and subjectively speaking? 2) How do we perceive and understand these other minds? 3) How are other minds represented in the brain? 4) Is the perception of minds in other species or artificial agents not just mere anthropomorphism? 5) Is it important how the other looks? Does it matter if the other is human-like (e.g., robots) or cute (e.g., animals)? 6) Does it matter at all if you think an agent has a mind on how you view yourself and others? And finally, 7) where does it all end? What methods and techniques, perspectives or approaches does the field need to answer these and future questions? Together, the answers to these questions suggest that minds are grounded in sociality and people judge minds on the capacity to feel and think, with a distinct neural network supporting this. There is emerging evidence on the flexibility thereof in terms of activity to diverse minds and presence of this network across species. Mind perception and anthropomorphism are distinct at the conceptual, psychological, and neural level, and beliefs and other top-down effects are more important than just the visual appearance of an agent. Reports on threat to human identity, intergroup effects, as well impact on group dynamics, show that there are clear inter- and intrapersonal consequences of mind perception. Future research should focus on an interdisciplinary approach embracing different disciplines from comparative psychology to linguistics, employing a multi-method assessment of mind perception in interactive, embodied, everyday situations, capturing the inter- and intrapersonal consequences thereof, to provide further answers on these and other questions.",

We improve on previous research by testing both NLMs and human participants in the same experimental set-up and directly comparing their results, and doing this cross-linguistically in both English and Dutch.

This article reviews these frequentist methods from philosophical and statistical perspectives, highlighting their conceptual foundations and procedural similarities. Although these approaches have gained popularity in the recent decade, the importance of SESOI was already emphasized by Neyman and Pearson within their original framework of hypothesis testing. When null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is conducted following the Neyman–Pearson framework, these tests yield identical results as their underlying logic is fundamentally the same once simplified. Building on this observation, the article proposes a simplified procedure involving that defines the null hypothesis as a negligible effect, the alternative as a non-negligible effect, and sets error rates according to theoretical expectations. This simplification helps avoid unnecessary computational complexity and prevents inconsistent statistical decisions that may arise from conditional equivalence testing, where an equivalence test is conducted only after a nonsignificant result from NHST.",

However, the factors driving these trends remain insufficiently explored. This study examines the determinants of psychiatric research output across countries, focusing on economic, demographic, and development-related variables. The analysis considers the annual number of publications, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population size, and the Human Development Index (HDI). Data were retrieved from Web of Science and considered all publications categorized under \"Psychiatry\" from 2000 to 2025 (N = 1,071,338 documents). A linear mixed model was employed to investigate GDP, population density, and HDI as predictors of publications output. The findings revealed that GDP and HDI are significant positive predictors of absolute and relative publication frequency in psychiatry (ps &lt; .001; R2 marginal absolute frequency = 50.53%, R2 marginal relative frequency = 52.32%). When analyzing data by continent, GDP emerged as a positive driver of publication frequency in Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, and South America (all qs &lt; .01). Additionally, HDI emerged as a key factor, particularly in Europe and Asia (all q &lt; .001). In contrast, population density did not show a significant association with publication output in any of the continents analyzed (qs &gt; .05). These findings indicate that greater economic resources, education levels, health care quality, and overall living standards are related to increased research production in psychiatry. This study provides a comprehensive overview of global trends in psychiatric research and their most influential factors.

          "abstract": "Human evolutionary history has been shaped by recurrent intergroup conflict, in which cooperation with group members carries high stakes and defection entails severe consequences. Such pressures should trigger evolution of mechanisms reliably communicating group commitment. Here, we test whether sacrificing strategic resources to signal group commitment may have evolved as such a mechanism. Using a public goods game with a cross-cultural sample (N = 2,745 participants from eight countries), we manipulated intergroup conflict by allowing some groups to compete over collective resources and permitting individuals to defect to the opposing group. Participants could signal cooperative commitment by sacrificing a portion of their endowment. We find that intergroup conflict (compared to no conflict condition) increases signalling both when signalling is costly and when it is relatively symbolic, suggesting that in conflict contexts, individuals exploit any available signalling opportunity, regardless of cost. Sensitivity to intergroup conflict in signalling behaviour was stronger in countries with higher recent exposure to intergroup violence. Moreover, individuals who signalled contributed more to the public good despite reduced endowments and were less likely to defect. Simulations of 10,000 conflicts showed that signalling groups were almost four times more likely to win a conflict than non-signalling groups. These findings indicate that intergroup conflict may have been a key selective pressure in the evolution of commitment signalling, with implications for how past and present societies build trust, sustain cooperation, and deter defection in competitive settings.",

We analyzed data from 80 participants who underwent both a laboratory-based TSST for groups (TSST-G) and a five-day ambulatory assessment with three beeps per day. Using linear multilevel models, we examined how mood and cortisol reactivity and recovery experienced in the TSST-G correspond to stressor-related responses in everyday situations. Results revealed that mood and salivary cortisol responses elicited by the TSST-G were not significantly associated with corresponding measures obtained in daily life. However, better recovery of positive mood following the TSST-G was linked to a stronger association between positive mood and recent stressors in daily life, suggesting that these associations might reflect aspects of stress recovery rather than immediate reactivity. In our study, indicators of stress reactivity and recovery obtained in the TSST-G diverge from corresponding indicators obtained via ambulatory assessments. This might indicate that the TSST-G may not effectively capture the full complexity of stress reactivity and recovery processes experienced in everyday situations. The study underscores the need for caution when extrapolating laboratory-based results to real-life contexts and calls for future research to further investigate daily life and laboratory associations of stress responses.",

However, a common criticism is that the model parameters are not directly observable and may not reflect the true choice process.  Here, we address this concern with several value-based experiments designed to assess these mechanisms more directly with mouse-tracking.  We find that people’s initial mouse movements are tied to their predispositions (i.e., starting points) and that their full mouse trajectories are tied to their evaluations (i.e., drift rates). We show that a base-rate manipulation changes people’s predispositions and thus their initial mouse angles. We also find that the speed of errors depends on predispositions. These results substantiate the influence of predispositions in value-based choice. Finally, we show that integrating these mouse-tracking measures into the DDM improves model fit.  We find that mouse-tracking can capture the physical manifestations of DDM parameters, validate process-level assumptions, and improve the predictive power of computational models.",

Participants (n=18) completed 108 free-form path planning trials, overlayed on a 2D contour map of bathymetric uncertainty, while avoiding marine dangers. Additional uncertainty was introduced via an AI agent with one of three face realism conditions, designed to sow doubt in the participants perceived task performance. Bayesian modelling suggests Contour lowered redraw rates, with a modest U-curve relationship. Variance followed an inverted U-curve effect on redraw rates, with moderate values reducing ambiguity and improving performance. AI agent appearance shaped trust behaviour, while environmental complexity reduced risk tolerance. Results of our experimental pilot study show that visual uncertainty, social agent appearance, and task complexity systematically shape human trust, risk tolerance, and decision-making behaviour during path planning.",

We then investigate how a range of realistic levels of measurement noise affect the estimation of five prominent evidence-accumulation models of RT and choice. Although models differ in sensitivity, we find that in all cases the estimation of at least some parameters is distorted by realistic levels of measurement noise. We propose and evaluate a ``binning'' method that not only ameliorates the resulting biases, but can also substantially reduce the computational cost of model fitting.",

We measured learning using a cover task during exposure periods, and using forced-choice questions followed by confidence judgments in repeated test blocks. Results revealed stimulus-dependent learning and metacognitive signatures. Learning dynamics differed across stimuli with fractal sequence test accuracy outpacing co-occurrence accuracy and vice versa for line drawings. Confidence increased across blocks, and was higher for line drawings and first but not second sequence selections. Metacognitive sensitivity increased alongside test accuracy for fractals but remained stagnant for line drawings.

I examine various features including the purpose of the analysis, data structure and as well as model specification, evaluation and interpretation. There is a clear upward trend in the currency of RF models, which are routinely applied to data with a clustering structure, where observations are grouped by speaker/text or lexical item. Essential details about the analysis are frequently missing from the reports. This includes information on software and model specification, predictive performance, and the type of variable importance scores used. Motivated by these insights, the current study provides a checklist for the reporting of RF models as well as an R tutorial on how to obtain key indices.

A cross-cultural sample of religious individuals from 15 countries spanning 5 world religions (N=11,186) is used to (1) estimate the association between ecospirituality and three pro-environmental outcomes: pro-environmental behavioural intentions, policy support, and financial donations; and (2) assess the pathways by which ecospirituality translates to pro-environmentalism. The results of pre-registered analyses showed ecospirituality positively predicted each of the pro-environmental outcomes similarly across diverse cultural and religious populations. Moreover, the associations between ecospirituality and pro-environmental outcomes were mediated by the same variables across cultures: (1) moral responsibility for nature, (2) gratitude to nature, and (3) self-efficacy over environmental issues. Ecospirituality unites diverse cultural worldviews in motivating care for nature, making it a potentially powerful foundation for global environmental stewardship.",

          "abstract": "Collapsing choice boundaries, where the criterion a person applies to make a decision gets less strict over time, are a key mechanism thought to underpin decisions under time pressure. However, previous work on collapsing boundaries has taken for granted that decisions are driven by a balance of evidence between options, as in diffusion decision models (DDMs). In this paper, we demonstrate that the key empirical pattern used to justify collapsing boundaries -- where slower decisions are made based on a smaller difference in evidence between choice options -- can arise from accumulator models with fixed thresholds. Through mathematical analysis, simulations, and reanalyses of three behavioral datasets, we show that fitting DDMs to data generated by accumulator models systematically favors collapsing boundary models, even when the true boundary is static -— a phenomenon we refer to as the collapsing boundary illusion. We further reveal that model mismatch not only distorts inferences about time-dependent thresholds, but also confounds estimates of between-condition differences of psychologically distinct parameters such as drift rates and decision boundaries. Furthermore, our results suggest that models with and without collapsing boundaries may be difficult to distinguish under relatively common models and experimental designs. Taken together, our results call for caution when interpreting inferences about decision boundaries, and indicate that researchers should consider alternative assumptions about evidence representation rather than relying on a single framework.",

          "authors": "NA; Amanda Kay Montoya; Samantha F. Anderson",
          "abstract": "Moderated mediation models are commonly used in psychological research and other academic fields to model when and how effects occur. Researchers must choose which paths in the mediation model are moderated when specifying this type of model. While the ultimate goal is to specify the model correctly, researchers may struggle to determine whether to err on the side of including too many moderated paths (maximalist approach) or including too few moderated paths (minimalist approach). This registered report examines how the specification of moderation impacts statistical power, type I error rate, and parameter bias for the index of moderated mediation. In a systematic review of papers published using moderated mediation over the course of one year, we found that six model specifications account for 85\\% of published moderated mediation analyses and the median sample size was 285. We ran a Monte Carlo simulation study to examine the impacts of model specification on power and type I error rate, and results were analyzed using multilevel logistic regression. In reference to the data-generating process, the data analysis model can either be correctly specified, over-specified, under-specified, or completely misspecified. Over-specified models were hypothesized to have lower statistical power to detect a significant index of moderated mediation compared to correctly specified models and relatively low parameter bias. Under-specified models were hypothesized to have lower statistical power than correctly specified models but unacceptably high parameter bias. Completely misspecified models were hypothesized to have inflated type I error rates and unacceptable parameter bias. Based on these results we recommend researchers lean more toward maximalist approaches to avoid parameter bias, but acknowledge that this comes with a cost in statistical power.",

          "authors": "Amanda Almond",
          "abstract": "Abstract\nObjectives: Persistent racial disparities in cardiovascular health among Black Americans reflect not only structural inequities in the United States, but also the racialized meanings of cardiovascular disease reproduced through public and private health communication. Drawing on ecological systems theory, this research examines how beliefs linking race and cardiovascular disease are reinforced through routine clinical interactions and how these meanings shape health behavior change. Method: Across two experimental mixed-methods studies, a model integrating ecological, social–cognitive, and behavior-change frameworks was tested. In Study 1 (N = 374), health-message framing was experimentally manipulated to examine effects on self-efficacy and decisional balance while controlling for prior experiences of racial microaggression in medical contexts. Study 2 (N = 589) extended this work by testing whether conceptualizations of race as biological/genetic and social/political moderated these effects. A subset of participants (n = 57) voluntarily provided narratives of racially charged healthcare experiences, which were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis to contextualize quantitative findings. Results: Racial microaggressions from health professionals disrupted self-efficacy and decisional balance for cardiovascular health behaviors. Endorsement of biological versus social race beliefs moderated these effects, shaping both their magnitude and direction. Qualitative findings revealed how everyday clinical interactions reproduce racialized meanings of disease risk and personal control. Conclusions: These findings identify clinical communication as a consequential site where racial meanings of disease are constructed and psychologically internalized, influencing motivation for health behavior change. Addressing biologically essentialist framing in healthcare may therefore be critical for strengthening self-regulation and reducing cardiovascular disparities among Black Americans.\n\nKeywords: racial microaggressions; health communication; self-efficacy; decisional balance; Transtheoretical Model; ecological systems theory; racial essentialism; cardiovascular health disparities\n\nPublic significance statement: How health professionals and public campaigns talk about race matters for behavior change. This research shows that subtle racialized cues in medicine can weaken Black patients’ sense of control and readiness to take preventive action. Training clinicians to avoid biological essentialist framing may improve patient engagement and help reduce cardiovascular health disparities.",

          "abstract": "Immersive virtual reality (VR) enables controlled tests of how emotional context distorts subjective time, yet findings remain mixed. Fifty-seven adults explored three five-minute VR environments (tranquil garden, neutral room, threatening sewer) while eye tracking recorded pupil diameter. Baseline stress was assessed before VR exposure. After each environment, participants estimated elapsed time and rated mood, calmness, and arousal. Repeated-measures ANCOVA (baseline stress as covariate) and linear mixed-effects models converged on a valence gradient: garden intervals were overestimated, sewer intervals underestimated, and neutral estimates were intermediate. Pupil diameter showed the complementary pattern (sewer &gt; garden &gt; neutral) and covaried with the magnitude of temporal distortion. Baseline stress did not predict time estimates and did not moderate valence effects. Results indicate that affectively distinct VR contexts reliably shift perceived time and elicit convergent physiological and self-report responses.

          "authors": "William E. Pelham; Lara Leitz; Herry Patel",
          "abstract": "We propose and evaluate two competing conceptualizations of parental monitoring of youths’ activities—a trait conceptualization and a state conceptualization. In a trait conceptualization, the level of monitoring is largely stable over time within families and youth behavior at any given moment is affected by the overall level of monitoring over a long period (e.g., past few months, past year). In a state conceptualization, the level of monitoring varies substantially from moment-to-moment and youth behavior at any given moment is affected by the current, acute level of monitoring. The trait and state conceptualizations have contrasting implications for designing research, identifying causal mechanisms, intervening with families to improve monitoring, and anticipating how youth will respond to temporary changes in the level of monitoring. Reviewing the literature, we find that most prior research has implicitly adopted the trait conceptualization despite there being little theoretical analysis or empirical evidence to justify the choice of one conceptualization over the other. No study has reported on the day-to-day stability of monitoring, though a handful have reported low day-to-day stability for closely related constructs (e.g., parental knowledge). Too few studies have tested shorter-term or acute effects of monitoring to make strong conclusions about the timescale of effects, though the extant evidence does not support the idea that monitoring measured today affects youth outcomes measured 6-12 months into the future. We conclude that the extent to which monitoring is best conceptualized as a trait or state remains an important open question.",

          "authors": "Courteney Tiegan Louise Fisher; José A. Alcalá; Gonzalo Pablo Urcelay",
          "abstract": "The developmental trajectory of the generalisation of avoidance has received limited research attention, despite generalisation and avoidance being key features of anxiety disorders. This study used a gamified avoidance task to investigate generalisation in 96 children aged 5–11 years old. The task was an adaption of the classic “Space Invaders” videogame, in which participants have to shoot at spaceships to win points but also avoid being shot by a large spaceship (i.e., aversive outcome). The appearance of the large spaceship (the outcome; which resulted in loss of points) was signalled by coloured sensors at the top of the screen. One sensor predicted the outcome (CS+; an aqua coloured sensor), and a second did not (CS-; orange). Participants could avoid the loss of points by moving into the safe areas of the screen in anticipation of the large spaceship. Following avoidance training, we then presented six generalisation stimuli varying along the blue-green dimension of the CS+, to assess generalisation. Our findings revealed that age significantly influenced generalisation gradients, with younger children (5-8) exhibiting broader gradients compared to older children (9-11). Regression analyses indicated that age, but not anxiety, was a significant predictor of generalisation. These results underscore the impact of ontogenetic changes on the generalisation of avoidance behaviour and highlight the importance of including young children in research to better understand the mechanisms underlying generalization and factors leading to anxiety disorders.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies have documented that overshadowing weakens when a CS-US trace is inserted, and we have interpreted such effect in terms of differential generalization in trace versus delay procedures, but direct evidence in humans is lacking. Two online experiments investigated whether the weakening of cue-outcome temporal contiguity impacts generalization gradients. Participants experienced strong temporal contiguity (the offset of a cue coincides with the onset an outcome) or weak temporal contiguity (there is a temporal gap between the offset of a cue and the onset of an outcome) in a continuous predictive learning task. Initial training involved a double negative discrimination, in which there was one reinforced cue (aqua-color rectangle) and two non-reinforced cues (one greener and one bluer than the reinforced cue), and participants had to make a response whenever they predicted the outcome. After training, in the generalization test phase, outcome expectancy in presence of several stimuli along the full green-blue dimension was tested. Outcome expectancy was assessed with discrete ratings in Experiment 1 (n=252) and a behavioral dependent measure (button presses, similar to the training phase) in Experiment 2 (n=250). Regardless the type of measure, when participants experienced weak cue-outcome temporal contiguity showed a broader generalization response, although differences were more prominent in the green side of the color dimension. Furthermore, no significant differences emerged between two groups experiencing strong temporal contiguity but differing in cue duration (controlling stimulus onset asynchrony, SOA), suggesting that cue-outcome temporal contiguity plays a more critical role than cue duration in shaping generalization. Overall, this result advances our understanding of the role of temporal contiguity at a basic level, while opening the possibility to study it as a critical factor in more applied settings.",

          "abstract": "Background: Interleaved practice is considered a desirable difficulty that fosters deeper conceptual understanding. However, its effectiveness appears to diminish when learning material becomes too complex, likely due to increased cognitive load.\nAims: This study investigates whether collaborative learning can enhance the effectiveness of interleaved practice when students engage with complex physics content.\nSample: A total of 376 upper secondary students (Grade 12/13) participated in the study.\nMethods: A 2×2 between-subjects field experiment was conducted with four conditions (interleaved vs. blocked practice × collaborative vs. individual learning). The instructional content focused on the motion of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields. Learning success was assessed through knowledge tests administered immediately after practice and after an 8-week delay. \nResults: The combination of interleaved practice and collaboration led to the highest learning gains, both immediately and after 8 weeks. There was no overall benefit of collaboration. Interleaving showed no main effect on immediate learning success and even a negative main effect on delayed learning success.\nConclusions: The findings suggest that collaboration mitigates the cognitive demands of interleaved practice, enabling its benefits to unfold even in complex learning contexts. The results highlight that desirable difficulties are not universally effective but require appropriate instructional support. Combining interleaved practice with collaborative learning emerges as a powerful strategy to foster lasting conceptual understanding in science education.",

          "abstract": "The majority of individuals experience potentially traumatic events in their lifetimes, yet most do not develop severe outcomes such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To understand this discrepancy, a growing area of study is psychological resilience, defined as the ability to adapt in response to adversity. Altered connectivity among large-scale brain networks—default mode (DMN), central executive (CEN), and salience (SN)—is well-documented in PTSD. However, less established is these networks’ functioning in highly resilient, such as World Trade Center (WTC) responders who have never developed WTC-related psychopathology despite substantial trauma exposure. We used resting-state fMRI data from a parent study of WTC responders (N=89) to investigate effective network connectivity (i.e., influence of network X on network Y) via Granger causality analysis. Planned contrasts compared three groups: WTC-related PTSD (n=29), high WTC-exposed responders with no psychopathology (“Highly Resilient”, n=32), and lower WTC-exposed controls (n=28). We also examined whether self-report and cognitive measures were correlates of effective network connectivity. We identified a group difference in effective connectivity, with greater influence of CEN on SN in Highly Resilient responders versus Lower WTC-exposed responders. Higher CEN-to-SN connectivity was also associated with better cognitive function in the full sample and with higher estimated IQ in the Highly Resilient group. In conclusion, greater top-down control of SN by CEN may represent a compensatory adaptation after substantial trauma exposure in highly resilient individuals, associated with better cognitive function.",

Participants in this sample rated their personality traits, life satisfaction, and self-esteem five times over 2 years. Using local structural equation models, we found high rank-order stabilities across age, with similar 1-year stabilities for Big Five domains and aspects (domains: raverage = .88, aspects: raverage = .87). Mean-level changes of aspects belonging to the same Big Five domain differed in timing and direction, and cumulative mean-level changes in personality traits were comparable to changes in self-esteem and life satisfaction. Finally, we found medium to strong correlated changes among Big Five domains (r = .33) and among aspects belonging to the same Big Five domain (r = .42), but confidence intervals of these correlated changes were broad. Our results contribute to a fine-grained picture of personality development and help to advance theoretical perspectives on personality trait changes.",

          "abstract": "Personality–well-being associations are widely documented, yet evidence from longitudinal, cross-national samples remains limited and often relies on ultra-brief measures with uneven psychometric performance. Using longitudinal data from the Global Flourishing Study (GFS; N &gt; 200,000 across 22 countries), we examined whether Big Five traits relate to well-being via half-longitudinal indirect pathways through basic psychological need satisfaction. Personality was assessed with the Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI), and well-being outcomes included life satisfaction, life worthwhileness, and happiness. Preregistered two-wave half-longitudinal mediation models, following recommendations for two-wave panel data, tested indirect pathways from conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness to well-being via competence, relatedness, and autonomy, respectively, controlling for prior levels of the mediator and outcome. Exploratory robustness analyses to evaluate cultural moderation and measurement sensitivity. Country-specific trait–life satisfaction slopes were estimated and meta-regressed on Hofstede’s Individualism–Collectivism index (IDV), with additional reliability-adjusted models incorporating country-level internal consistency estimates and sensitivity analyses using single-item (positively keyed) personality indicators. Across models, basic psychological needs robustly predicted subsequent well-being. In contrast, personality–well-being associations and apparent cultural moderation patterns were highly sensitive to measurement precision, particularly for conscientiousness and neuroticism. Results highlight both the value and inferential limits of ultra-brief personality assessment in global panel studies, highlighting the importance of routinely evaluating reliability variability, item functioning, and robustness when interpreting cross-national personality–well-being effects.",

We designed a short-form online intervention for deepfake NSII.

Over three pre-registered experimental studies (N = 1628), we provide evidence of the efficacy and acceptability of the intervention, including tests in high-perpetrating populations. The intervention lowered belief in myths about deepfakes (e.g. that they are not harmful because they’re not real), and partly reduced intentions to perpetrate (e.g. to watch, share, or create deepfake NSII) with the effects on watching behavioural intention still evident at follow-ups ranging from one week to one month.

          "abstract": "Residential relocations can affect well-being and travel behaviour in ambiguous ways. This study conceptualises moving voluntariness as an explanatory variable leading to favourable outcomes for voluntary movers and less favourable outcomes for involuntary movers. Specifically, we expect that voluntary movers will change or maintain travel behaviour in line with previous attitudes due to higher control and that involuntary movers will adapt more strongly to their new built environment due to lower control levels. We test this using longitudinal panel survey data of individuals expecting (n=1,234) and later realising a move (n=411). Using a novel, subjective voluntariness measure, we find that voluntary movers show improved well-being (i.e. mental health, life satisfaction, residential satisfaction, place attachment), while involuntary movers show similar but non-significant changes. Neither group shows changed travel attitude-behaviour consistencies, suggesting that subjective voluntariness does not directly translate into distinct travel behaviour change pathways. However, involuntary movers showed consistently weaker car orientations and lower mobility needs fulfilment, hinting at stable differences in travel characteristics of mover groups. Despite similar demographics, involuntary movers report lower perceived control, earlier moving stages, and higher future-location uncertainty. Our suggested subjective measure provides different well-being and travel insights than previous objective approaches. We suggest conceptual and methodological refinements, e.g. in terms of dimensionality, time-variability, reliability, and possible relations to personality/trait variables.",

To inform research design and improve clinical care, it is critical to determine if these symptom-specific effects occur at different rates.\nObjective: To determine the symptom-specific time-to-improvement of depression symptoms during citalopram treatment.\nDesign: The study uses STAR*D data, which prescribed citalopram as the first stage of an open-label, multi-stage clinical trial of stepwise treatment strategies for depression. This first stage typically lasted 12 weeks and follow-up assessments were, on average, every-other-week.\nSetting: Multi-center\nParticipants: Over 4,000 adults aged 18-75 years diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder without psychotic features participated in the STAR*D trial. Participants were prospectively enrolled patients in both primary and specialty care venues.\nInterventions: All participants started 20 mg/day of citalopram. If this dose was well tolerated, it could be increased to a maximum of 60 mg/day. Stage 1 typically lasted 12 weeks.\nMain Outcome(s) and Measure(s): This exploratory secondary data analysis focuses on change in the total score and each of the individual items, of the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-SR.\nResults: 3,248 depressed adults were available for the present analyses (Mean age = 41 year (SD=13 years), 62% female)). The number of observations differed for each model. The median time for 1 standard deviation improvement in depression symptoms was 28 days. Median time for 1 point improvement (all possible thresholds are reported in text) varied widely for individual symptoms. The quickest improving symptom had a median-time-to-improvement of 15 days (increased weight) and the longest took 41 days (mid-nocturnal insomnia). The rank-order of which symptoms improved the quickest was highly consistent across models with different improvement thresholds (Spearman’s ρ = .66-.91, all p &lt;.005) and when stable improvement across multiple follow-ups was required (Spearman’s ρ=.97, p=.003). \nConclusions and Relevance: Results indicate that different depression symptoms respond to citalopram at different speeds. In addition to implications for designing clinical trials, this information is essential for developing realistic treatment expectations and to facilitate shared decision-making between clinicians and their patients about how to select treatments.\nTrial Registration: STAR*D is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov under ID NCT00021528 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00021528).",

Existing tools such as the Climate Change Anxiety Scale (CCAS) and the Hogg Eco-Anxiety Scale (HEAS) capture only partial aspects of the phenomenon. This study aimed to test the continuum hypothesis of eco-anxiety by jointly calibrating these two instruments within an item response theory (IRT) framework. A French sample of 534 participants completed a combined version of the CCAS and HEAS, analyzed using the Graded Response Model. Results showed a satisfactory unidimensional fit, with all items displaying acceptable discrimination. The HEAS predominantly assessed moderate manifestations, while the CCAS reflected more severe functional impairments. However, nearly a quarter of respondents with the lowest levels of eco-anxiety were not captured by either scale, indicating insufficient coverage of the mildest forms. External validity was supported through strong correlations with negative emotions and emotion-focused coping, but weaker associations with action-oriented strategies. These findings support the eco-anxiety continuum and highlight the need for refined tools capable of covering its entire spectrum, from adaptive concern to clinical manifestations.",

Questioning this assumption, it was recently proposed that context is not encoded but only reconstructed. Any aspect of an event could thus become either item or context depending on the question asked. Here we provide evidence consistent with this hypothesis across six pre-registered experiments employing a context reinstatement paradigm. When the recognition memory test focused on background scenes, reinstating the original objects increased the rates of old responses to targets and lures. We further showed that this effect remained when background scenes were task-irrelevant, and objects task-relevant, at encoding. Finally, Experiments 4-6 showed that this effect can be found when objects are task-irrelevant at encoding, but that this effect depends on the size of the objects. Overall, these results support context is reconstructed rather than encoded, but that the perceptual properties of the stimuli can limit the effect of context on memory retrieval.",

          "abstract": "When individuals learn through experience, they tend to choose the options they believe will produce the most favorable outcomes. Research by Harris and colleagues (2020) indicated that this inclination to consistently engage with the perceived optimal choice can bias the resulting evidence, potentially perpetuating inaccurate beliefs under certain conditions. As it is unclear whether this effect is driven by people attempting to approach positive outcomes, or by their drive to avoid negative outcomes, the current study aims to distinguish between those two motives. Participants completed a two-armed bandit task with identical options, where initial evidence was manipulated to induce the belief that one option was better than the other. Experiment 1 was conducted in a rewarding context, where financial gains served as a reinforcer (as opposed to neutral outcomes), while Experiment 2 featured a negative context, with the omission of an expected aversive event as a reinforcer. Behavioral measures showed signs of a lasting bias in the aversive context of Experiment 2, corroborated by a bias in explicit contingency estimates. No such effects were observed in the positive context of Experiment 1. These findings suggest that lasting biases in experiential learning are driven more strongly by negative than positive outcomes. Implications for the acquisition of irrational aversive beliefs are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Trial-wise subjective awareness ratings, particularly the Perceptual Awareness Scale (PAS), have been widely recommended for assessing awareness in masked priming research. Central to this approach is the assumption that awareness may fluctuate across trials, and that such changes in awareness are accompanied by corresponding changes in priming. We put this assumption to a direct test by reanalyzing data from three masked priming experiments examining evaluative response priming and semantic priming, each including samples with and without trial-wise PAS ratings. Using effect course analysis, we traced the development of PAS-ratings and priming effects during the experimental session. Across experiments, PAS-ratings systematically increased with practice, including in catch trials in which no prime was presented, indicating a shift in response criterion rather than increased perceptual awareness. Critically, these changes in PAS-ratings were not accompanied by corresponding changes in priming effects, and individual changes in PAS-ratings and priming effects were uncorrelated. Moreover, priming exhibited qualitatively different time courses in samples with versus without PAS-ratings, suggesting that trial-wise awareness ratings alter priming dynamics. These findings challenge a key assumption underlying trial-wise subjective awareness ratings and raise methodological concerns about the use of PAS in masked priming research.",

          "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into decision-making systems—such as autonomous vehicles and medical devices—understanding how humans perceive and evaluate AI-generated judgements is crucial. To investigate this, we conducted a series of experiments in which participants evaluated justifications for moral and non-moral choices, generated either by humans or LLMs. Participants attempted to identify the source of each justification (either human or LLM) and indicated their agreement with its content. We found that while detection accuracy was consistently above chance, it remained below 70%. In terms of agreement, there was no overall preference for human-generated responses, even though machine-generated justifications were favored in particularly challenging moral scenarios. Notably, we observed a systematic anti-AI bias: participants were less likely to agree with judgments they believed were AI-generated, regardless of the true source. Linguistic cues, such as response length, typos, first-person pronouns, and cost-benefit language markers (e.g., “lives,” “save”), influenced both detection and agreement. Participants tended to disagree with cost-benefit calculations, possibly due to an expectation that AI would favor such reasoning. These findings highlight the influence of motivated belief and ingroup/outgroup bias in shaping human evaluation of AI-generated content, particularly in morally sensitive contexts",

          "abstract": "Spontaneous thought is often considered an unconstrained, internally generated mode of thinking that is independent of the present perceptual environment, making it difficult to study empirically. However, recent accounts have raised the possibility that the generation and content of spontaneous thought can be shaped by even weak perceptual constraints. We leveraged this new perspective to develop a novel approach using music, a ubiquitous stimulus that permeates our everyday environments, as a window into the mechanisms supporting spontaneous thought content. Adults spanning four age groups listened to music from ten different genres and completed the open-ended task of writing descriptions of any thoughts that arose. By applying natural language processing analysis to the spontaneous thought descriptions, we found that thoughts sustained while hearing music from the same genre shared greater semantic similarity than those sustained while hearing music from different genres, and participants from the same age group experienced more similar thoughts than those from different age groups. Properties that varied naturally with genre, including the music’s auditory features, expressed emotions, and contextual associations, all contributed significantly to explaining the greater semantic similarity of thoughts within genres. These results demonstrate that spontaneous thought is jointly shaped by perceptual and experiential constraints, opening new avenues for understanding when and why particular thoughts come to mind, with implications for creativity and mental health.",

Data were collected in two waves from the same sample of homicide offenders (N = 65 in the first wave; 48 of these participated in the second wave). Psychopathy facets were assessed using the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM). Higher disinhibition and meanness were linked to more hostile attributions in ambiguous relational harm scenarios. Also, they predicted greater intentionality attributed to both male and female authority figures, while increased blame was assigned only to female authority figures in physically harmful scenes. Contrary to expectations, higher levels of disinhibition, meanness, and boldness were associated with reduced recognition of anger in ambiguous facial expressions. Meanness was also related to delayed initial fixations on angry faces compared to other emotions and longer gaze durations on male fearful faces compared to female fearful faces.

Although anecdotal evidence suggests that music-evoked nostalgia can occur even without prior listening experience, previous studies did not address the cognitive and emotional processing. Based on an existing model, this study quantitatively investigated the factors associated with nostalgic experience evoked by music without listening experience. Our results showed that music-evoked nostalgia without prior listening experience was associated with the same contextual features as nostalgia with prior listening experience, including familiarity, autobiographical salience, and mixed emotional responses. In contrast, low arousal and personality traits related to susceptibility to sadness were associated only with nostalgic experience, which differs from previous studies on nostalgic experience for music with listening experience. These results enhance our understanding of how music can evoke nostalgia not only through autobiographical memories but also through its comprehensive structural properties.",

This assumption is particularly tenuous in experience sampling method (ESM) studies, where participants complete questionnaires in daily life across a range of potentially distracting situations. Previous research suggests that participants may be particularly distracted when responding to ESM questionnaires in social situations, especially when engaging in social interactions. Yet, the effects of these environmental distractions on response behavior and, consequently, data quality remain poorly understood. We investigated the effects of distracting environments on disturbance and response behavior across various social and non-social situations. ESM data from three young adult samples (combined N = 293) and a general population youth sample (N = 1903) was analyzed with multilevel (logistic) regressions. In line with previous research, adults were significantly more disturbed by assessments when in company compared to when alone, especially when also interacting with their company. In addition, we found small but significant differences in response behavior between social settings in adults, with changes pointing towards lower data quality when in company. Interestingly, patterns were different–in some cases even reversed–in school-going adolescents. While our findings suggest that the distraction of social settings affects participant burden and response behavior, the influence on data quality was minor. Differences across samples suggest that the setting of the social experience (in vs outside school) needs to be considered. Preparing participants for sampling in distracting (social) environments may help safeguard data quality and reduce participant burden.",

German-speaking high school graduates (N = 874 between ages 16 and 20; 69% female, 95% born in Germany) reported on their affective well-being in up to four surveys and indicated their motivation for their post-school pathway. At three measurement occasions, participants also participated in a three-week experience sampling phase, in which they reported on their daily well-being. Latent change models revealed an initial increase in well-being after graduation, but mixed evidence for subsequent trajectories, as both positive and negative affect decreased on average. Changes in well-being were more pronounced for global than for daily assessments of affective well-being. We did not find associations between the motivation for a post-school pathway and well-being trajectories. Overall, these findings highlight the complexity of well-being trajectories during the transition out of upper secondary education and the importance of using multiple time points and assessment methods to understand these dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Background\nSocial defeat is often cited as a motive for suicide. The experience of defeat may arise from feeling dominated in a dyadic conflict or from losing status in a group. We hypothesize that sensitivity to dyadic defeat will be related to the onset of suicidal behavior in early or mid-life and sensitivity to loss of status, in late life.\n\nMethods\nThe study’s sample of 245 adults aged 50 years and older (mean = 63.2 years, SD = 7.4) comprised 42 early-onset and 32 late-onset suicide attempters (aged &lt; 50 vs ≥ 50 years at their first suicide attempt), 114 depressed non-attempter comparisons, and 57 non-psychiatric comparisons. Using a validated rigged video game tournament task, we operationalized compensatory responses to the two forms of social defeat as point stealing from individual opponents (one-on-one defeat) and rank buying in the league table (loss of status in a group).\n\nResults\nEarly-onset attempters increased point stealing the most over time (χ2 3 = 22.37, p &lt; .001), whereas late-onset attempters purchased more rank after losing trials than early-onset attempters and non-psychiatric comparisons (χ2 3 = 9.47, p = .024). Each effect was robust to adjusting for age and sex, other effects of interest, and to the exclusion of long-string responders.\n\nConclusions\nOur behavioral findings suggest that socio-behavioral processes leading to suicide vary across the life cycle. While vulnerability to dyadic defeat could be suicidogenic for people of any age, loss of social status could play a role in suicidal crises specifically occurring in later life.",

However, 10% of participants endorsed a novel and highly bizarre raccoon army conspiracy theory that we invented, almost certainly insincerity, and endorsement of this conspiracy theory was a strong predictor of endorsing pre-existing conspiracy theories, including the two contradictory ones. Moreover, 13% of participants reported that they had responded insincerely during the study, which was also a strong predictor of endorsing pre-existing conspiracy theories. Overall, our results suggest that anonymous online surveys can produce inflated estimates of the prevalence of belief in conspiracy theories, which raises serious questions about how studies of “belief in” conspiracy theories – and misinformation more broadly – have been interpreted.",

In young adults, free time substantially improved performance. Passive repetition also improved performance, but not beyond the effect of free time. Active repetition, on the other hand, slightly impaired it. In 9-year-olds, active repetition also impaired performance, but free time provided little benefit. These findings demonstrate that providing more free time during instruction delivery improves performance in young adults but is far less effective in children, suggesting important developmental differences in the short-term maintenance of instructions and the (strategic) use of free time.",

In a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled feasibility trial, 75 treatment-seeking adults with anxiety and depression were assigned to six sessions of floatation-REST with prescribed scheduling, floatation-REST with preferred scheduling and duration, or a zero-gravity chair comparison condition. Altered states of consciousness were assessed using the 5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire, alongside measures of interoceptive awareness and affect. Compared to the chair condition, Floatation-REST was associated with increased interoceptive awareness of cardiorespiratory sensations and an altered state of consciousness characterized by oceanic boundlessness, disembodiment, unity, and spiritual-type experiences—a pattern we refer to as “aquahenosis.” Effects were strongest among participants who selected longer and more flexible float sessions. Experiential profiles selectively overlapped with those reported for psilocybin and ketamine along boundary-dissolution dimensions. These findings identify Floatation-REST as a tractable, non-pharmacological method for inducing specific altered states of consciousness and highlight positively valenced boundary dissolution as a modality-invariant experiential dimension linking sensory context to affective change.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: The concept of an auditory target that is monitored by the sensory-motor system during speech is central to most models of speech production, yet little is known about the nature of these auditory targets. The goal of this study was to determine whether the auditory feedback controller for speech uses “idealized” acoustic targets or simply attempts to correct deviations from the motor commands to the speech articulators.\n\nMethod: We investigated the stability over time of the auditory targets used for online auditory feedback control (AFC) of fundamental frequency (fo) and first formant frequency (F1) using a combination of auditory perturbation experiments and computational modeling. Twenty-three young adults participated in reflexive fo and F1 perturbation experiments across four different days: two mornings and two afternoons. \n\nResults: Analysis of unperturbed productions across participants indicated that baseline fo varied with session number, and baseline fo and F1 varied with time of day. The pattern of the participants’ compensatory responses to upward and downward fo and F1 perturbations across sessions with low and high baseline fo/F1 values strongly indicated that the auditory target used for AFC differed between low and high baseline sessions. Computer simulations of the SimpleDIVA model were used to quantitatively compare this variable-target model (in which AFC utilizes a different target in different sessions) to a single-target model; these simulations verified the superiority of the variable-target model.\n\nConclusions: Our findings indicate that the auditory targets for AFC arise from predictions generated from the ongoing motor command, i.e. the efference copy, rather than an idealized and optimal auditory target, and they have important implications for models of speech motor control.",

          "abstract": "Humans often learn functional relationships in environments shaped by their own prior actions rather than by repeated exposure to an objective ground truth. The present research investigated how people learn functions when learning is based on self-generated samples. Across three preregistered behavioral experiments (N ≈ 1,800), we introduced a novel experimental paradigm that occupies an intermediate position between experience-based learning and iterated learning. Participants repeatedly learned relationships between two variables across multiple rounds, where training data in later rounds were generated from their own prior predictions rather than from an externally defined function. The results revealed a characteristic combination of inductive bias, stability, and flexibility in human function learning. Learned relationships were systematically aligned with the true underlying functions, and the relative ordering of learned correlations in the final round preserved meaningful distinctions among functional forms. At the same time, learning trajectories exhibited strong path dependence: once formed, beliefs about functional structure tended to persist across rounds. Analyses of learning-phase behavior and cognitive modeling showed that differences across functions were primarily driven by initial error rather than learning rate. Together, these findings demonstrate that learning from self-generated samples does not inevitably lead to runaway bias. Instead, it supports adaptive knowledge acquisition while revealing how prior assumptions and feedback jointly shape learning over time. The present paradigm provides a new framework for studying learning in environments where experience is endogenously generated.",

          "abstract": "Correlations in science typically matter as indications of underlying causal structures. In two recent studies, a direct correlation between respiration and the cortical readiness potential (RP) is claimed, with support for causation suggested by the use of terms such as ‘impact’ and ‘modulate’. Following these papers, the notion of a causal relation between respiration and the RP has been repeated in the literature. However, to support the claim that respiratory phase is directly correlated with RP amplitude, all reasonable potential confounds must first be ruled out. We show that a simple confound suffices to explain the observed coupling between respiration phase and the RP: RP amplitude is also coupled with movement onset, which, as these studies rightly reveal, tends to coincide with breathing phase. To test for direct correlation, we must fix one of the variables and test its effect on the other. Grouping RP amplitudes according to respiratory phase (thereby fixing the respiration-behavior coupling), we show that evidence for an RP-respiration coupling disappears. We show this to be true in the original dataset, in a new independent dataset we collected, and in a simulated dataset expressly engineered to have no direct coupling.",

To accomplish this goal, we assessed the determinants of affective valence in a context where these hypotheses make clear and dissociable predictions – classical conditioning. Across three studies, we found consistent evidence that affective valence tracked value per se, rather than value updates. Additionally, we show that more optimistic expectations can lead to more positive affective responses to actual outcomes. These results provide insight into the relationship between value and affective valence, and thus inform the broad range of psychological research that depends on an understanding of the connection between these constructs.",

We compared Voice Onset Time (VOT) production in two groups of multilinguals: L1 Spanish learners (a ``true voicing'' language) and L1 Thai learners (a three-way contrast language), both with English as an L2. Results indicate that the typological similarity between L1 and L3, rather than L2 status, determines L3 production outcomes. L1 Thai learners successfully mapped Mandarin stops to their native (un)aspirated categories, achieving near-native accuracy via facilitative transfer. In contrast, L1 Spanish learners showed non-facilitative CLI from their L1. We further identify regressive transfer (phonetic drift) exclusively in the Spanish group, where exposure to aspiration systems (English and Mandarin) shifted native Spanish voiceless stops away from the monolingual baseline.

          "authors": "Taylor G. Hill",
          "abstract": "Healthy personality profiles, characterized by higher extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness alongside lower neuroticism, are often assumed to support broad flourishing across the life course. Yet it remains unclear whether healthy personality primarily predicts higher levels of well-being, greater stability over time, or systematic change. Across two studies, we examined what having a healthy personality does for well-being by distinguishing between levels, stability, and change. Study 1 used cross-sectional data from a community sample to test whether a profile-based Healthy Personality Index (HPI) was associated with broad mental well-being. Healthy personality was strongly associated with higher well-being and accounted for substantial variance relative to demographic factors, while providing a parsimonious summary of personality-related variance. Study 2 used a four-wave longitudinal panel to examine whether healthy personality predicted evaluative well-being across time, change in psychological richness, and stability in well-being. Healthy personality was associated with higher average life satisfaction and life worthwhileness across waves and with greater temporal stability in life satisfaction. In contrast, healthy personality did not predict increases in psychological richness and was associated with smaller gains over time. Together, these findings suggest that healthy personality primarily supports the maintenance and stability of well-being rather than transformation or growth.",

          "authors": "Alexander Samuel Weigard; Andrew Heathcote; Chandra Sripada",
          "abstract": "Research into cognitive control has flourished over the last three decades across many areas of the psychological and neural sciences, but problems have recently emerged that raise foundational questions about what cognitive control is, how individual differences should be measured, and the validity of cognitive control as an explanation for variation in behavioral traits and clinical conditions. Here, we outline a novel perspective that is rooted in evidence accumulation models, formal mathematical models that explain how individuals make choices across many contexts. We review model-based work that distinguishes conflict-specific processes, which are selectively engaged to address goal-conflicting information, from task-general processes that facilitate goal-congruent responding irrespective of the presence of conflict. We then highlight the computationally-derived measure we call efficiency of evidence accumulation (EEA) that reflects the task-general amplification of goal-congruent information. EEA forms a trait-like individual difference dimension, explains individual differences in performance in cognitive control tasks, and shows clear relevance to behavioral traits and clinical conditions in which control is thought to be impaired. These findings help address multiple theoretical, methodological, and empirical challenges in the study of cognitive control and provide a promising way forward for characterizing control processes that enhance goal-relevant responding across time and contexts.",

          "authors": "Kyla Brannigan; Lea Frank; Dagmar Zeithamova",
          "abstract": "Flexible use of memory involves both the ability to form detailed memories of individual experiences (specificity) and to generalize across related experiences (generalization). Memory specificity and generalization have been attributed to distinct neocortical regions, such as ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and ventromedial PFC respectively. Hippocampus has been traditionally associated with memory specificity, but more recent work highlights additional role in generalization. Here, we tested the hypothesis that hippocampus supports both memory specificity and generalization, but through interactions with distinct cortical regions. Fifty-two adults learned to categorize blended face stimuli, enabling both extraction of category structure (generalization) and encoding of item-specific features (specificity). Background functional connectivity was measured using fMRI during passive viewing of the same faces before and after learning. Participants showed robust category learning, above-chance recognition of studied faces from similar lures, and successful category generalization to novel category members. Recognition and categorization performance were not highly correlated, suggesting distinct processes supporting each memory function. In the brain, we found distinct connectivity profiles of anterior hippocampus, presumed to preferentially support generalization, and posterior hippocampus, presumed to preferentially support specificity. Learning led to increased anterior hippocampal connectivity with default mode regions including ventromedial PFC, and posterior hippocampal connectivity with visual cortex. Increased anterior hippocampal connectivity with ventromedial PFC, somatomotor cortex, and visual cortex predicted better category generalization, whereas increased posterior hippocampal connectivity with ventrolateral PFC predicted more accurate face recognition. Whole-brain exploratory analyses revealed widespread learning-related changes in cortico-cortical interactions, with changes in connectivity among visual, somatomotor, and default mode networks predicting categorization. Together, these findings support the notion that hippocampus supports both memory specificity and generalization through interactions with distinct cortical regions. These results advance mechanistic accounts of how the hippocampus and cortex coordinate to balance competing memory demands.",

In two studies, we aimed to examine the role of conversational remembering on autobiographical reflection under experimentally-rigorous and ecologically-valid conditions. This registered report examined how the experience of a shared reality with a communication audience affects: (a) how rememberers attached the recalled event to their self-concept, (b) how connected rememberers felt with their communication audience, and (c) the role of the recalled event when projecting future experiences. Study 1 used an experimental design that manipulated both shared reality and event valence to examine effects on communicators’ perceptions of self, social, and future outcomes. Study 2 used a daily diary design to examine experiences related to conversational remembering in everyday life. Findings indicate that shared reality is a critical component of the communication process enhancing self, social, and directive memory outcomes, regardless of event valence. This work builds upon previous research to more fully understand the role of communication processes on autobiographical consciousness and the meaning individuals derive from their remembered life experiences.",

We term these errors discretization errors, develop their mathematical model, and show how they can be corrected for when calculating slopes and correlations in linear models using a correction similar to the Spearman one for classical errors, and correction factors similar to classical reliabilities. This allows a general way to model and correct for these types of errors. Any situation where multiple true scores get collapsed can be understood with this model. We discuss how existing approaches fit into this general framework (e.g., scoring binary responses using Item Response Theory), and sketch the broader range of situations where the model can be applied. Discretization errors have the capacity of organizing, guide modelling, and furthering our understanding about an extensive class of errors beyond classical ones, that psychological researchers frequently encounter.",

Here, in a pre-registered study, we adapted a dense sampling approach to reconstruct the millisecond time-course of memory encoding in n=125 participants. We found that memory encoding fluctuated at a theta rhythm (3-10 Hz), that these rhythms were not a byproduct of rhythmic attention, and that—like theta rhythms in the brain—memory rhythms were modulated by putative markers of acetylcholine. Our findings provide behavioral evidence consistent with the SPEAR model of episodic memory.",

          "abstract": "Background: Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) affects approximately 1.8% of adolescent females and 0.3% of males, with onset typically between ages 12 and 16 years. Image-based social media platforms and algorithmic content curation have created digital environments that may influence appearance-related psychopathology in vulnerable youth, yet no synthesis has examined these mechanisms with attention to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) practice.\n\nMethods: This narrative review synthesised evidence on associations between social media use and BDD symptoms in adolescents through searches of PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar (January 2015 to December 2025), focusing on algorithmic mechanisms, emerging digital phenomena, gender-specific presentations, and clinical implications.\n\nResults: Cross-sectional evidence demonstrates platform-specific effects, with image-based platforms showing significant associations with BDD symptoms. Appearance-motivated social media use is more predictive than total screen time, and intolerance of uncertainty may moderate this relationship. Algorithmic personalisation may create filter bubbles increasing appearance-focused content exposure, while variable-ratio reinforcement maintains compulsive engagement. Gender differences are evident: females predominantly experience skin and weight concerns amplified by filtered imagery, while males increasingly present with muscularity preoccupations linked to \"looksmaxxing\" communities. Emerging phenomena include Zoom dysmorphia and AI-powered appearance tools.\n\nConclusions: This review proposes the Algorithmic Amplification Model of Digital BDD and introduces the Digital BDD Screening Tool for Adolescents (DBST-A) for CAMHS assessment. Cognitive-behavioural therapy requires adaptation incorporating digital exposure hierarchies and algorithmic literacy psychoeducation. Clinicians should routinely enquire about platform-specific behaviours, editing practices, and engagement with AI tools and appearance communities.",

          "abstract": "Human coordination depends on two complementary mechanisms: forward-looking strategies that enable flexible adaptation to new circumstances, and backward-looking mechanisms that rely on precedent, convention, and rule-following. Most cognitive and computational models of coordination emphasize one mechanism or the other—either explaining how equilibria emerge and persist when agents adapt their behavior based on past experience, or how agents creatively generate novel solutions and strategies to achieve anticipated mutual benefit in the challenges of the moment—but not how the two interact. Here we introduce a cognitive model and experimental paradigm to capture the dynamics of both processes and, crucially, the arbitration between them. In two preregistered experiments (n = 510; 30,420 choices), participants repeatedly solve coordination problems that can be addressed either by generalizing past solutions or by adopting novel ones when precedent becomes inefficient. This design allows us to examine the conditions under which individuals or dyads decide to abandon entrenched equilibria and transition to novel coordination solutions by arbitrating between mutual benefit and precedent. By formally modeling both forward- and backward-looking mechanisms, and the process of arbitration between them, we provide a unified framework for understanding how human coordination can be both stable and adaptable—a property that underlies everyday cooperative behavior, social norms, and institutional evolution.",

          "abstract": "Precision psychiatry aims to identify biomarkers and develop prediction models to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment selection for mental illness. Despite extensive research, translating findings into clinically useful tools remains challenging. Here we argue that one key contributor to this translational gap is a pervasive misalignment between routine statistical analytic practices and the criteria for clinical utility. To address this, we introduce E2P (effect-to-prediction) Simulator, an interactive web tool for estimating the real-world predictive value and clinical utility of biomarkers and prediction models by accounting for real-world outcome base rates and measurement reliability – a procedure we term predictive utility analysis. Similar to how power analysis helps optimize research for statistical significance, predictive utility analysis can help optimize it for practical significance. The interactive nature of E2P Simulator makes this approach accessible to non-statistician researchers while also providing publication-ready figures to aid with transparency and standardization of reporting. We demonstrate its application in three key areas: diagnostic (depression, Alzheimer’s disease), treatment response (antidepressants), and risk (suicide attempts and psychosis onset) prediction, highlighting conditions under which we may expect clinically meaningful advances. While we focus on translational challenges in psychiatry, the framework and tools presented here address general statistical challenges and are broadly applicable across biomedical and behavioral sciences.",

          "abstract": "Human social preferences serve as oversight or training data to shape how Artificial Intelligence (AI) makes decisions, which occurs increasingly across decision-making domains, including social decisions that influence human to human interactions. Here, we test how algorithms with and without prescribed social preferences, shape social decision-making and explore delegating further decisions. In an incentivized online experiment (n = 1290), participants provided social preferences for outcomes favoring oneself or an anonymous other, Social Value Orientation (SVO), as input to a decision-making algorithm. We manipulated whether for each SVO money division question, participants saw no default options (representing providing training data) or proself/prosocial default options (representing oversight of algorithms with prescribed selfish/prosocial preferences). Default options were either from an algorithm or not. Results showed that participants’ social preferences were not significantly impacted by providing input to an algorithm without prescribed preferences (vs no defaults) nor by an algorithm with prescribed prosocial preferences (vs the same defaults without an algorithm and vs the algorithm without prescribed preferences). Only providing input for an algorithm with prescribed proself preferences resulted in more selfish social preferences (vs the algorithm without prescribed preferences and vs the algorithm with prescribed prosocial preferences). Moreover, counter to this, participants perceived being less influenced by proself than prosocial defaults. Most people delegated a second social decision-making task to the algorithm they were exposed to. These findings suggest that human oversight could be insufficient to address algorithmic biases, as individuals act more selfishly when exposed to pre-existing selfish tendencies in algorithms.",

One unanswered question is whether autistic participants can flexibly adjust the speed and accuracy of their decision-making according to task demands. Across two pre-registered studies, 50 autistic and 50 non-autistic children aged 6-14 years completed a visual orientation task with no explicit instructions to be fast or accurate, and a visual motion task under both speed-emphasis and accuracy-emphasis instructions. These studies allowed us to investigate the influence of task, task instruction and modelling approach on group differences. We fit Bayesian hierarchical DDMs using a rigorous blind modelling approach, and follow-up two-step non-hierarchical analyses. For the first time, we showed that autistic children can flexibly adjust their decision-making strategies according to speed-accuracy instructions. Irrespective of task, instructions and modelling approach, we found no conclusive evidence of group differences in any DDM parameters, highlighting that autistic and non-autistic children were both able to modulate task performance according to instruction. These results show that cognitive flexibility is not uniformly reduced in autism. To better understand within-participants variability, we investigated relationships between decision-making parameters and ADHD-related traits, reading ability, sensory processing and coordination skills. We found task-specific evidence for relationships between DDM parameters and sensory under-responsivity, sight-word reading and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Resolving inconsistent results when applying DDMs to autism will require contrasting modelling approaches, clear reporting of task instructions, and considering dimensions that co-occur with autism.",

          "abstract": "Arithmetic skills are crucial for mastering everyday life up to old age. However, it is unknown whether the interplay of different task characteristics affects arithmetic performance differently in older and younger adults. The aim of this study was to investigate whether older adults show deficits in arithmetic fact retrieval besides general slowing. Older (≥ 60 years) and younger adults (18 – 34 years) solved single-digit arithmetic problems in a verbal production paradigm. Arithmetic performance and strategy use were assessed for all four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), varying in problem size (small vs. large). Older adults were slower than younger adults in all operations except multiplication. Older adults were able to preserve a similar problem size effect, as they used fast retrieval strategies more often than younger adults to solve large single-digit problems (except for division). While older adults can retrieve arithmetic facts equally well as younger adults, they are slower when using procedural strategies. Overall, this study suggests that older adults do not show deficits in arithmetic fact retrieval but their arithmetic fact knowledge is even superior to that of younger adults and therefore can compensate for some of the age-related domain-general cognitive deficits.",

Caffeine increased skin conductance level and subjective arousal and reduced mental fatigue relative to placebo. All video conditions also facilitated recovery, with the horror video producing the largest improvement. However, we found no evidence that physiological arousal and media-induced emotion interacted to enhance recovery beyond their separate effects.

We compared three types of thermodes at two stimulus durations to assess potential impacts on QST outcomes.\n\nAcross two experiments, a total of 83 (45 and 38 respectively) healthy volunteers each completed two QST tasks that varied in thermode type (ATS, CHEPS or T03) and/or stimulus duration (8s or 3s), with order counterbalanced across participants. In each task, heat was applied to 8 sites on the left volar forearm for three runs (24 trials in total) and temperatures were selected through an adaptive staircase calibration procedure. Pain threshold, tolerance, and the strength of the correlation between stimulus temperature and pain ratings (r²) were estimated using linear regression. \n\nResults indicate that briefer stimuli were associated with higher pain tolerance (t = -3.28, p = 0.018), while there was no effect of duration on threshold or temperature-rating correlation. Thermode type influenced pain tolerance in short (3s) (t = -3.10, p = 0.01) but not long (8s) durations, such that on 3s trials, tolerance was higher with the smaller surface thermode (T03) compared to the larger surface thermode (CHEPS), consistent with spatial summation. No sex differences were found. These results demonstrate that suprathreshold pain tolerance, but not threshold, is sensitive to stimulus duration and thermode type. These findings also indicate the importance of methodological standardization in QST and the careful selection of suprathreshold pain stimuli in experiment design.",

Using self-paced reading with yes/no comprehension questions, we analyzed a structurally diverse set of eleven types of ambiguous and unambiguous sentences. Our results revealed that contextual bias was the most robust predictor of processing difficulty, significantly influencing both reaction times and response accuracy. Specifically, the likelihood of a misanalysis, as indexed by cloze scores, predicted the persistence of incorrect interpretations and reanalysis difficulty. In contrast, verb bias, surprisal, and plausibility exerted weaker or inconsistent effects, with only plausibility showing a limited interaction in the accuracy data. These findings suggest that comprehenders rely heavily on contextual cues when interpreting syntactically ambiguous input, and that reanalysis success depends not solely on structural preferences or lexical predictability but on the overall likelihood of the initial misanalysis and of the intended interpretation.",

However, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) investigating PF in relation to affect-event dynamics and other psychopathology are scarce. Leveraging EMA data from 16,038 mental health app users, this study examines how baseline impairments in PF, within-person affect-event dynamics, and depression predict longitudinal outcomes in PF impairment and depression severity. We hypothesized a central role of PF in these relationships. Within the first month of usage, on average, 69.3 (range 31-142) mood assessments and 63.3 (range 25 - 133) event assessments were available per user. Dynamic structural equation models (DSEM) showed that baseline depression was associated with weakened or even negative concurrent and cross-lagged links between mood and positive events, including lower inertia and reduced likelihood of positive events. In contrast, baseline PF impairment was associated with persistence, emotional impact and volatility of interpersonal conflict events as well as with greater mood instability. Over a one-year follow-up (N = 1,464; M = 1,236 assessments per user), DSEM identified different patterns: Future PF impairment and depression were both predicted by less concurrent mood-positive event associations, less positive event volatility, and baseline average mood/events. Among affect-event dynamics, cross-lagged effects of interpersonal conflicts on mood explained the highest unique variance of future PF impairment (ΔR2 5.9%). Notably, baseline PF exhibited the strongest overall predictive utility (ΔR2 = 19.5%), followed by baseline depression symptoms (ΔR2 = 11.9%) with PF showing higher variance explanation in future depression severity than vice versa. Results offer specific targets for interventions: assessment of PF could help to inform decisions regarding duration, goals, and intervention strategies beyond the treatment of personality disorders.

          "abstract": "Objective: Psychological richness has been proposed as a distinct dimension of the good life, characterized by complexity, emotional engagement, and perspective-altering experiences. However, relatively little is known about the personality traits and everyday processes that give rise to psychologically rich lives. Method: In a four-week longitudinal study (N ≈ 300), we examined how personality, daily psychological need satisfaction, and week-to-week experiential qualities relate to psychological richness and other well-being outcomes. Results: At baseline, openness to experience emerged as the strongest personality correlate of psychological richness, alongside extraversion and agreeableness. Personality traits did not predict changes in psychological richness over the four-week period once baseline richness was accounted for. Satisfaction of competence, relatedness, and novelty needs was associated with higher life satisfaction and life worthwhileness, with novelty showing unique within-person associations above and beyond other needs. Weekly excitement predicted increases in psychological richness from Week 1 to Week 4, controlling for baseline richness. Conclusions: These findings highlight richness as an experiential pathway to the good life that is distinct from happiness and meaning.",

          "abstract": "Objective. Sexual minority populations are growing, experience elevated physical and mental health risks, and have unique stressor exposures. However, biopsychosocial research on sexual minority individuals at the population level remains limited. Addressing this gap, we launched the National Couples’ Health and Time Stress Biology Study (NCHAT-BIO), the first US-based study focused on stress biology within a large, diverse sample of married/cohabiting sexual minority and heterosexual adults. NCHAT-BIO capitalized on the unique opportunity of NCHAT, a population-representative US sample which intentionally oversampled sexual minority respondents. \nMethods. NCHAT-BIO was approved by The Ohio State University and Gallup Institutional Review Boards. A total of 950 participants completed at-home dried blood spot (DBS) collection with return by mail. After exclusions, 787 respondent samples were assayed. Samples were analyzed for interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) antibodies. Final analytic samples were: IL-6 (n=452), CRP (n=663), EBV (n=647, including n=84 EBV negative). These biomarker data can be merged with rich NCHAT survey responses, time diaries with an embedded Experience Sampling Method (ESM) component, and contextual state- and county-level indicators. \nDissemination. Wave 1 NCHAT-BIO data have been deposited at ICPSR for public release; the current report should be cited in future empirical manuscripts using these data. Wave 1 NCHAT survey data are also at ICPSR, and the two archives will be linked to facilitate integrated use. \nFuture Directions. Whole blood data collection from Wave 3 NCHAT participants will begin in 2026. Planned assays, which will also become publicly available, include IL-6, CRP, and epigenetic aging (per DNA methylation).",

Scope of justice theory posits that abstract ideals constrain concrete judgments primarily when targets fall inside one’s moral community. In a probability-based United States sample (N = 1,386, with oversamples of Hispanic and MAGA-identifying respondents), Democrats and Republicans endorsed civic ideals at similarly high levels yet applied them selectively. Among respondents who morally included undocumented immigrants, civic ideals were associated with more critical evaluations of ICE and greater anger toward enforcement. Among those with exclusive moral boundaries, civic ideals showed weak or null associations with enforcement judgments. Moral inclusion and perceived procedural justice were jointly associated with substantial attenuation of partisan gaps in legitimacy judgments of both ICE and local police. Polarization reflects selective application of shared principles rooted in disagreement over moral standing.",

          "abstract": "Self-reference can increase susceptibility to misinformation, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the current study, we introduced an explicit memory reactivation phase prior to misinformation exposure to investigate how self-referential encoding affects the formation of suggestive false memories. Twenty-eight participants encoded event scenarios either as protagonists directly involved in the events (i.e., self-reference) or as bystanders observing others (i.e., other-reference), and subsequently read narratives containing misleading information. Behavioral results showed that self-referential encoding led to higher misinformation acceptance. Event-related potential analyses revealed that self-reference enhanced late memory reactivation, indexed by the late positive component (LPC), but not early reactivation of the frontal N400 (FN400). During misinformation exposure, misleading information elicited greater late posterior negativity (LPN) than control information, specifically for self-referential memories, reflecting increased source monitoring demands. We also found that successfully rejected misinformation elicited more negative LPN than control information, again specifically for self-referential memories. Our findings imply that self-reference enhances susceptibility to misinformation through two potential mechanisms: stronger late-stage memory reactivation that increases memory instability, and enhanced integration of misinformation with self-representations, which triggers source monitoring without ensuring successful rejection.",

We propose a framework which leverages a recent advance in the interpretability of DNNs---mechanistic interpretability---to uncover shared algorithmic structure between DNNs and the brain via two parallel pathways. The Mechanism-to-Brain pathway uses interpretability to extract computational mechanisms from models that generate hypotheses about neural implementation. The Brain-to-Mechanism pathway begins from observed brain–model correspondences and applies interpretability to identify model components that could instantiate similar computations. These pathways interact through mutual constraints, ensuring that advances in one domain inform and delimit inquiry in the other, and through iterative refinement, where discrepancies between models and data drive the reciprocal revision of both mechanistic analyses and neuroscientific hypotheses. Together, they establish a principled route toward causal, mechanistic explanations of cognition, positioning DNNs as computational model organisms for probing the algorithms of the brain.",

          "abstract": "Social interactions are inherently complex, shaped by dynamic trust building, biases, and adaptive strategies. Yet in laboratory settings, their study is often constrained by small datasets that nonetheless encode rich and sophisticated cognitive processes. This scarcity has historically limited modeling approaches to hand-tailored frameworks that embed strong priors about the underlying mechanisms. Recent advances in data-driven modeling of latent dynamical processes provide an alternative, extracting generative models directly from behavioral data without restrictive assumptions. Building on these methods, we derive hierarchical digital twins from sparse, non-Gaussian investment sequences in repeated trust games. Our approach proceeds in three stages. First, we demonstrate that, despite the limited data, the inferred twins can accurately predict future investments, establishing predictive validity and providing a solid baseline for subsequent mechanistic analyses. Second, we analyze the latent dynamics of these models and show that they capture mechanistic structure in how investments and choice uncertainty are organized in state space and how social versus non-social cues are represented, in a way that parallels patterns observed directly in the empirical behavior. Third, we exploit the generative nature of the hierarchical digital twins to run in-silico experiments beyond the original data, such as probing how specific cues steer participants into trusting or mistrusting states and simulating responses to novel, unobserved cue-outcome combinations and trustee strategies. Together, this work demonstrates how generative digital twins open a new path toward mechanistic, data-driven accounts of social interaction dynamics that both reproduce observed behavior and support hypothesis generation in virtual environments.",

          "authors": "Benjamin PUTOIS",
          "abstract": "Cet article présente le modèle de la dynamique du soin incarné (DSI), un modèle neuro-phénoménologique intégratif qui propose que le sentiment d’existence émerge de la coordination rythmique entre le corps, l’émotion et le récit au fil du cycle veille-sommeil de 24 heures. En se concentrant sur le trouble de stress post-traumatique complexe (PTSD-C), il avance que le traumatisme perturbe cette intégration rythmique, fragmentant la conscience et produisant la triade caractéristique du trouble : désorganisation du soi, dysrégulation émotionnelle et instabilité interpersonnelle. Les troubles du sommeil associés au PTSD-C ne sont donc pas des symptômes secondaires, mais les expressions nocturnes d’une même désynchronisation qui fracture le Soi incarné.\nLe modèle identifie trois pôles neurofonctionnels : le Soi-Soi, ancré dans les réseaux hémisphériques droits et vagaux qui assurent la sécurité corporelle et l’intéropception (dominant durant le sommeil lent profond) ; le Soi-Autrui, centré sur les circuits gauches amygdalo-hippocampo-préfrontaux et langagiers qui transforment l’affect en signification symbolique (liés au sommeil paradoxal) ; et le Soi-Monde, qui synchronise ces dimensions dans l’engagement relationnel et la vitalité (éveil). Lorsque le traumatisme désynchronise ces pôles, la conscience perd sa cohérence, donnant lieu aux manifestations typiques du PTSD-C : hyperactivation, dissociation, apathie.\nCes pôles soutiennent quatre piliers expérientiels de l’existence : la Sécurité, la Présence, la Vitalité et l’Existence. Chacun reflète une dimension fondamentale du Soi vivant ; leur déséquilibre entraîne la fragmentation du sentiment d’être. La DSI  reformule ainsi le PTSD-C non comme un trouble de la mémoire, mais comme une pathologie du rythme, une incapacité du temps à reprendre son cours après le traumatisme.\nSur le plan thérapeutique, la DSI  unifie les approches somatiques et psychologiques en proposant un modèle de guérison incarnée et rythmique. Il inspire la conception d’un protocole EMDR 2.0, intégrant la régulation des huit émotions primaires de Panksepp par des régulateurs naturels (tremblements, bâillement, marche, cris, vomissement, etc.), associés à la rescénarisation symbolique et au jeu de rôle incarné. L’objectif n’est pas seulement la réduction des symptômes, mais la restauration d’un rythme global entre sommeil, émotion et vitalité.\nSur le plan éthique, la DSI  envisage la thérapie comme une co-régulation rythmique entre deux systèmes vivants, le patient et le thérapeute, dont la synchronie restaure la continuité du Soi. À une époque marquée par la désynchronisation collective, il invite à repenser la santé mentale comme l’art de retrouver les co-rythmes qui soutiennent l’être.",

This tutorial provides an accessible yet rigorous introduction, designed to bridge the gap between statistical theory and practical application. After an overview of common applications, we discuss different ways of representing circular data mathematically and fundamental principles for working with them. We explain angular and vector representations and operations, including key considerations for implementing them in computer code. We then survey methods for visualizing circular data, including linear and polar plots and presentation of summary statistics. Next, we discuss circular measures of central tendency, dispersion, and shape: how they relate to their Euclidean counterparts, and why they differ. Finally, we turn to more advanced topics of the kind needed to construct models of circular data. We introduce the most common circular distribution families, including circular analogs of the Gaussian distribution and their properties, as well as flexible distribution families that can describe skewed and heavy-tailed data. The tutorial takes a method-oriented approach, not tied to specific software, but highlighting factors relevant to experimental design, data analysis, and statistical modeling. A consistent theme is the need to rigorously account for the inherent periodicity of circular data. We also provide a consistent notation for circular statistics and parameters, addressing the lack of established conventions in the field.",

Spaced repetition and retrieval practice are two effective and well-documented strategies that reliably improve both comprehension, retention, and knowledge transfer. They can also increase interest and reduce test anxiety, making them especially relevant for teachers. However, many learners misunderstand or underutilize these strategies, and research indicates they are underrepresented in teacher education curricula. To investigate this, we analyzed assigned readings in Norway’s largest postgraduate teacher training programs (PPU-A). Using zero-shot text classification, we identified 992 excerpts likely to address repetition or retrieval. Two coders then evaluated whether these excerpts contained accurate explanations or examples. We found no complete explanations of either strategy. Some excerpts provided clear examples, but most were incomplete or ambiguous. This suggests that two fundamental cognitive strategies with clear educational relevance are being overlooked or misconceived in teacher education curricula.",

Data-driven methods describe how decision processes vary across trials using trend models, while theory-driven methods explain adaptations in response to specific factors. By moving beyond the IID assumption, our approach allows for a more precise characterisation of dynamic cognitive processes such as learning, adaptation, and fatigue.

These outcomes may differ between males and females with ADHD, but whether these differences are more pronounced in ADHD or similar to those in the general population remains unclear. Method. In an 18-year follow-up of 283 children (Mage =  28.48) we assessed if sex moderated 51 long-term outcomes across 7 domains: psychiatric status, behavioral/emotional problems, academic/professional functioning, adaptive functioning, neurocognition, physical health, and healthcare service use in those with ADHD (nfemales = 50,  nmales = 104), and without ADHD (nfemales = 77, nmales = 52). Additionally, we aimed to explore the moderating role of gender-expression. Results. Sex interacted with group for social functioning: males with ADHD were more likely to show lower social functioning compared to females with ADHD and controls. There were no sex differences on the other outcomes. As sex and gender-expression were highly similar (r = .94), specific effects of gender-expression could not be studied. Conclusions. Generally, sex did not have a more pronounced effect on long-term outcomes of childhood ADHD in individuals with ADHD compared to the general population.

In efforts to understand the factors influencing people’s willingness to use technology, numerous variables have been proposed that may affect the motivation to adopt it. At the same time, various theoretical models have been developed to explain how the experience of using technology is formed.\nThe aim of the present study is to examine the relationship between attitudes toward technology and attitudes toward technology-free situations. To this end, attitudes toward different types of environments were measured using questionnaires.\nThe experiment examined the relationship between attitudes toward a new technological human resources system and attitudes toward the old, non-technological system.\nThe study’s findings indicate a negative (statistically nonsignificant) relationship between attitudes toward the old system and attitudes toward the new system—a result consistent with previous findings.\nThe discussion presents two possible explanatory approaches to the experience occurring during technology use. According to the first approach, the experience arises only when the particles composing the neurons assume finite and fixed values; prior to that, only the probability of their values can be estimated, and thus the experience is not yet conscious, although the information is stored in long-term memory. In contrast, the alternative approach holds that the experience is based on the retrieval of previous examples stored in memory — meaning that the experience is a reconstruction of one of those examples.",

System 3 can supplement or supplant internal\nprocesses, introducing novel cognitive pathways. A key prediction of the theory is\n“cognitive surrender”—adopting AI outputs with minimal scrutiny, overriding intuition\n(System 1) and deliberation (System 2). Across three preregistered experiments using an adapted\nCognitive Reflection Test (N = 1,372; 9,593 trials), we randomized AI accuracy via hidden seed\nprompts. Participants chose to consult an AI assistant on a majority of trials (&gt;50%).

This allows a general way to model and correct for these types of errors. Any situation where multiple true scores get collapsed can be understood with this model. We discuss how existing approaches fit into this general framework (e.g., scoring binary responses using Item Response Theory), and sketch the broader range of situations where the model can be applied. Discretization errors have the capacity of organizing, guide modelling, and furthering our understanding about an extensive class of errors beyond classical ones, that psychological researchers frequently encounter.",

We argue that this preference for extremes also shapes the beliefs they adopt: many citizens who describe themselves as moderate partisans increasingly endorse the most extreme positions on core policy issues. We call this pattern belief acrophily: the tendency to hold predominantly extreme positions on political issues in relation to one’s own political identity. Using American National Election Studies data from 1972–2024, we show that belief acrophily has risen sharply over time: by 2020 and 2024, moderate Democrats and Republicans were more likely to place themselves at the extreme ends of issue scales on social benefits, health care, and race than at the midpoint. Panel data reveal that moderate partisans with extreme views are substantially more likely to adopt stronger partisan identities in the future. This analysis suggests that polarization is deepening not only through increased issue position sorting according to party membership, but also through intensifying extremity of moderates’ positions on concrete issues.",

The results showed that anxiety was negatively predicted by expectancies and values, and positively by costs, but that there were significant individual differences in these associations. For example, some students experienced higher anxiety when they had low expectancies, whilst some when they had high expectancies. Furthermore, the results showed that expectancies and values negatively predicted relatively higher anxiety for a particular student. Overall, the findings highlight the particular role of expectancies, values, and costs on statistics anxiety and the variability between individuals across learning situations.",

          "abstract": "Childhood trauma has been consistently associated with elevated levels of neuroticism in adulthood, a transdiagnostic trait marked by emotional instability, heightened negative affect, and stress sensitivity. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesise evidence examining the association between childhood trauma and adult neuroticism, both overall and by specific trauma subtypes. A comprehensive search of four electronic databases identified 136 eligible studies, encompassing a total of 526,371 individuals. Using a random-effects meta-analysis, results revealed a significant positive association between childhood trauma and adult neuroticism (g = 0.46). The strength of the association between neuroticism and the different trauma subtype varied. The strongest association was observed for emotional neglect (g = 0.40), followed by emotional abuse (g = 0.33). In addition, there were associations between neuroticism and physical abuse (g = 0.18), physical neglect (g = 0.15), sexual abuse (g = 0.22), unspecified abuse (g = 0.13), and victimisation (g = 0.21), with the exception of unspecified neglect, which showed no significant association. These findings demonstrate a robust relationship between early adversity and neuroticism. Childhood trauma may lead to adaptions that give rise to neuroticism through several psychological mechanisms such as disruptions in attachment and the formation of negative self-beliefs, and neurobiological alterations in stress regulation systems. These results underscore the importance of systemic preventative measures and early intervention strategies that may alleviate the psychological and neurobiological consequences of trauma, with the potential to increase awareness of adaptions such as neuroticism in trauma-exposed populations.",

          "abstract": "Research has shown that rest is beneficial for memory consolidation. However, periods of\nrest are also prone to evoke mind wandering (MW) episodes, which have been observed to be an\nobstacle to learning. As such, an apparent paradox arises from these observations: individuals\nbenefit from rest to consolidate memories, but those periods of rest are likely to elicit MW episodes,\nwhich are seen as impeding consolidation. Using the caught probe paradigm, we measured the\neffect of MW frequency over performance in two dot pattern classification tasks after two types of\nperiods of rest: rest in silence and rest with preferred music. We found that MW and rest conditions\ninteract to predict accuracy in a Novel or Old categorisation task, but not in a Category Classification\ntask. Although rest with music was predictive of better post-rest task performance in the Novel or\nOld task, MW frequency was related with higher accuracy only when participants rested in silence.\nWhat is more, we found that participants’ attitudes towards music reliably moderated the effect of\nMW over the Novel or Old task accuracy. Together, these results show that MW during rest is\npotentially beneficial for short-term memory consolidation and does not necessarily interfere with\nit.",

          "authors": "Carly A Lasagna; Timothy Joseph Pleskac; Alexander Weigard; Ivy Fei Tso",
          "abstract": "Background and Hypothesis: Individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) show difficulties deciding whether social cues are meant for them, which are implicated in paranoia and social functioning. Recent computational modeling findings suggest that such disruptions may stem from inefficient and biased “evidence accumulation”—the process of gathering information to make a decision. However, it is unclear whether these disruptions are specific to social information processing, particularly self-referential processing, or whether they reflect general processing deficits. \nStudy Design: Mechanisms and clinical correlates of decision-making were examined in 39 SZ and 42 controls across three domains: self-referential social processing (eye contact detection task), non-self-referential social processing (facial gender identification task), and non-social general perceptual processing (visual integration task). Drift Diffusion Models characterized whether inefficient and biased evidence accumulation in SZ was specific to self-referential processing or reflected more general deficits.  \nStudy Results: Relative to controls, evidence accumulation in SZ was less sensitive to visual cues during eye contact detection and gender identification—not visual integration. Biased evidence accumulation occurred in SZ only during eye contact detection. In SZ, less sensitive evidence accumulation during eye contact detection and gender identification—not visual integration—was associated with worse paranoia, even after controlling for general processing difficulties. \nConclusions: Aberrant self-referential social processing in SZ may be shaped by mechanisms supporting social and self-referential—but not basic visual—information processing. Paranoia was associated with disrupted processing of social—not non-social—information. Therefore, disrupted evidence accumulation in SZ may have differential symptom associations across social and non-social contexts.",

          "authors": "HebatAlla Hassan Daban",
          "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain condition characterized by widespread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive complaints, with symptoms that commonly fluctuate over time and intensify during episodic flare-ups. While central sensitization is widely recognized as a core neurophysiological feature of fibromyalgia, existing models primarily emphasize baseline vulnerability and provide limited explanation for the dynamic mechanisms underlying symptom exacerbation.\nThis paper proposes a neuro-cognitive trigger model that conceptualizes fibromyalgia flare-ups as emergent events arising from the interaction of sustained cognitive load, persistent emotional background stress, and insufficient neural recovery acting upon a neuro-sensitive baseline. Rather than advancing a causal etiology for fibromyalgia, the model focuses specifically on the conditions under which transient symptom exacerbations are more likely to occur, emphasizing temporally dynamic regulatory processes within the central nervous system.\nGrounded in established literature on central sensitization, cognitive load theory, stress neurobiology, and sleep-related recovery mechanisms, the proposed framework integrates these elements into a unified, trigger-based formulation. The model highlights recovery failure as an active modulatory factor in flare dynamics and explicitly distinguishes between baseline neuro-sensitivity and trigger-dependent symptom escalation.\nImportantly, the neuro-cognitive trigger model generates testable hypotheses suitable for prospective, within-subject research designs, including ecological momentary assessment and longitudinal symptom tracking. By offering a structured and operational conceptual framework for studying flare-up dynamics, this work aims to support future empirical investigation and contribute to a more precise understanding of fibromyalgia as a disorder of neural regulation rather than static pathology.",

          "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by alterations in social understanding and self-related experience that overlap with broader dimensions of psychosocial vulnerability. These domains are tightly interconnected, motivating the use of analytic approaches that can capture their organization as complex associations rather than as isolated dimensions. We applied network analysis to individuals with autism (N = 156) and matched neurotypical controls (N = 454). Gaussian graphical models were estimated using sum scores of psychosocial constructs, and networks were compared using centrality metrics and the Network Comparison Test. Compared to neurotypical participants, individuals with ASD showed higher levels of psychosocial difficulties and lower global network strength. Mentalization emerged as a central node in both groups, while autistic traits were more central in the neurotypical network and trait anxiety showed relatively higher centrality in the ASD network. These findings suggest that psychosocial vulnerability in autism is characterized by a distinct and less integrated network organization, with mentalization playing a central organizing role across groups and anxiety exerting a relatively greater influence in ASD. Network-based approaches may therefore help identify mechanism-relevant targets for intervention and refine dimensional models of social and self-related functioning in autism.",

          "abstract": "Sensory perception is often described as atypically calibrated in autism, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We tested whether temporal magnitude perception in autism relies on amodal or modality-specific processes using an adapted range-of-standards paradigm. Autistic and nonautistic adults judged auditory and visual durations in blocks that varied in contextual range and whether the contextual standards were presented in the same modality as the central standard. Non-autistic participants showed clear auditory specialization and larger context effects within than between modalities, consistent with modality-specific coding. Autistic adults, however, showed reduced auditory specialization and similar effects across modalities, suggesting broader and less differentiated temporal calibration. To determine whether these patterns could be explained by synesthetic cross-modal tendencies, we tested an additional group of adults with synesthesia. Synesthetes showed calibration patterns that resembled the non-autistic group, indicating that the unique cross-modal context effects observed in autism cannot be attributed to synesthetic mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Most research on student AI use asks who adopts these tools, treating AI use as a stable personal characteristic. Yet each time students encounter a problem, they face a fresh decision about whether to seek AI help. We examined when students choose AI assistance by analyzing both stable individual differences and moment-to-moment decisions. Undergraduate students (N = 398) completed 30 quiz trials, freely choosing on each trial to answer independently, consult an AI chatbot, or rely entirely on AI. Before each decision, students rated their topic expertise. We also measured cognitive abilities, AI attitudes, and demographics. Multilevel modeling revealed that almost half the variance in AI use reflected stable individual differences; the other half varied within individuals across trials. Self-assessed expertise accounted for this within-person variation: students sought AI help primarily when they felt unknowledgeable about a topic. At the between-person level, fluid intelligence predicted more chatbot consultation but less full delegation, suggesting higher-ability students use AI strategically rather than as a substitute for thinking. Male students and those with favorable AI attitudes showed greater willingness to delegate entirely. These findings reframe AI use as adaptive help-seeking rather than a fixed trait. Educational interventions that target metacognitive calibration, helping students accurately judge when they need assistance, may prove more effective than blanket AI policies that assume uniform use patterns.",

          "abstract": "As workplaces become increasingly diverse in age and gender, understanding how discrimination affects employees' experiences and decisions to remain with their organisations is essential. This study examined how perceived ageism and sexism relate to employees' authenticity and work retention intentions, whether these associations vary by age and gender, and whether authenticity mediates the link between discrimination and retention. \nUsing multilevel data (Nemployees = 263,696, Nfirms = 832), we tested predictions derived from the double jeopardy framework, whereby holding multiple stigmatized identities (e.g., being both older and female) increases exposure to discrimination. Results indicated that women aged 55 and over reported the highest levels of both perceived ageism and sexism, consistent with double jeopardy. Both forms of discrimination were negatively associated with authenticity and retention, with ageism showing stronger effects than sexism. However, contrary to expectations, men and younger employees exhibited stronger negative associations between perceived discrimination and both outcomes. Authenticity emerged as a significant mediator at both individual and organisational levels, with full mediation observed at the organisational level. \nThese findings suggest that although older women perceive the most discrimination, the downstream consequences of bias do not necessarily mirror its prevalence. Men may be more negatively affected by discrimination due to less developed coping strategies or greater perceived labour market mobility. Practically, organisations should foster climates that support authentic self-expression to improve employee retention across demographic groups",

          "abstract": "As people engage in tasks over extended periods, their psychological states change systematically due to factors such as practice, learning, and/or boredom. However, the dominant frameworks for modeling cognitive processes, such as evidence accumulation models, only consider a single estimate of a process across the duration of an experiment. Our study describes, develops, and assesses the ParAcT-DDM framework: the Parameters Across Time Diffusion Decision Model, which unifies previous modeling efforts from practice and decision-making research. Specifically, our framework models time-varying changes to diffusion decision model parameters by assuming that rather than being constant across time, their estimates follow theoretically informed time-varying (e.g., trial-varying or block-varying) functions. Focusing on two diffusion model parameters: drift rate (task efficiency) and threshold (caution), our empirical results show that ParAcT-DDM variants vastly outperform the standard diffusion model in four existing data sets, including one where participants completed a practice block before data recording began, suggesting that time-varying cognitive processes often occur in typical cognitive experiments, even when the experimental design explicitly tries to remove practice effects. Finally, we find that the existence of time-varying processes causes systematic biases in the parameter estimates of the standard diffusion model, suggesting that our ParAcT-DDM framework can be crucial to ensuring the robustness of inferences against time-varying changes, regardless of whether these changes are of direct interest.",

This paper introduces the nested ecological affordances framework, a relational model grounded in ecological psychology that situates behavior within a multi-scalar ecology of opportunities for action. Affordances for sustainable action are defined as possibilities relative to actor capabilities and are understood here as hierarchical, dynamically evolving, and embedded within micro-level infrastructures, meso-level practices, and macro-level policies and cultural narratives. Illustrative cases demonstrate how nested affordances scaffold sustainable practices through reciprocal dynamics and coordinative structures. By integrating psychological determinants, choice architecture, and social practices within systemic contexts, the framework offers a heuristic for policy and design that expands sustainable opportunities across scales and supports resilient sustainability transitions.",

This is especially important in countries like China, where extended households are common. We used semi-structured interviews with 16 Chinese parents of autistic children from diverse educational and income backgrounds and focus group discussions with 11 service providers, to explore their perspectives of the role of extended relatives in the care of autistic children. Using template thematic analysis, we developed three themes: (1) Unambiguous active support from extended relatives: “My siblings and parents always remind me to take good care of my child”; (2) Complex or ambivalent support: “when it comes to grandparents, things can get complicated”; (3) Disengagement in care or stigmatising attitudes: “I felt they didn’t see my son as worthy”. Each theme also considers individual and family characteristics shaping extended relatives’ willingness to support the family. Central influences included the relatives’ understanding and acceptance of autism, and socio-economic factors. More effort is needed to help extended relatives better understand autism. This may include building on supportive relatives, engaging limited supporters, and addressing negative attitudes to reduce stigma.",

In this research, we examined whether synthetic participants can reproduce human responses to both existing and prospective public policies across multiple domains in three non-WEIRD countries: the United Arab Emirates, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. We generated synthetic participants using several LLMs, including GPT-4o, GPT-5, and DeepSeek, systematically varying temperature settings and the richness of prompting information, from generic country-level descriptions to detailed demographic and qualitative profiles. Performance was evaluated using complementary indicators, including directional agreement, aggregate correlations across policies, sensitivity to different policy instruments, and distributional similarity. Across analyses, synthetic participants closely matched human responses in terms of the direction and relative ordering of policy judgments. GPT-4o, particularly at temperatures 0.5 and 1.0, consistently outperformed other models. Notably, even generic prompting achieved strong performance for policy support. However, all models produced narrower response distributions than humans, as observed by previous studies. Overall, our findings suggest that synthetic participants can provide scalable insights on human policy views in underrepresented contexts.",

Altered reward processing is a robust risk for depression in non-autistic youth that remains understudied in autistic youth even though in autism, depression is highly prevalent, reward differences are documented, and social difficulties are diagnostic features. In the present study, we demonstrate how we successfully adapted an EEG protocol to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of two EEG paradigms to measure social and nonsocial reward positivity (RewP) in 60 autistic adolescents (14-17 years old; 31.7% female sex) as a first step towards examining altered reward responsivity as a risk factor for depression in this population. Findings suggest that these EEG paradigms are feasible to collect high quality data in this population, acceptable to most autistic adolescents, and reliable in measuring the expected RewP waveform.  A significant difference emerged in RewP to monetary win and loss, but not for social acceptance and rejection suggesting that social motivation may be blunted in this population and/or that alternative methods (e.g., time-frequency analyses) may be necessary to more fully understand reward responsivity in this population.",

Biofeedback interventions have been increasingly investigated as non-pharmacological approaches to reduce anxiety and enhance musical performance; however, evidence regarding their effectiveness, training characteristics, and outcome specificity remains fragmented. Aim. This systematic review aimed to synthesize evidence on the effects of biofeedback techniques on musician's mental health and performance. Methods. A systematic literature search was conducted across Scopus, PsycINFO, and PubMed. Studies investigating biofeedback interventions targeting anxiety, performance, or physiological outcomes in musicians were included. Study selection followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Results. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. Interventions included electroencephalography (EEG) - based neurofeedback, autonomic biofeedback, and multimodal biofeedback approaches, with durations ranging from single-session protocols to multi-week and multi-month training programs. Anxiety-related outcomes were most consistently improved by autonomic and multimodal biofeedback, whereas EEG neurofeedback more frequently yielded improvements in expert-rated musical performance. Physiological modulation, including changes in EEG activity, reductions in muscle tension, and improvements in heart rate variability, was observed across intervention types. Conclusions. Biofeedback interventions represent a promising non-pharmacological approach for reducing performance anxiety in musicians. Future studies should standardize outcome measures, define optimal intervention dosage, and directly compare different biofeedback modalities to inform evidence-based implementation in musical performance contexts.",

          "abstract": "Stepped care has been proposed as an efficient and scalable framework for delivering pediatric psychotherapy. This meta-analysis examined the effectiveness, generalizability, and implementation characteristics of stepped care interventions for the prevention and treatment of mental health problems in children and adolescents. Across included studies, stepped care interventions demonstrated large significant overall pre–post improvements in health outcomes (d = 1.22, 95% CI [0.944; 1.50]). When compared with control conditions effects were small and non-significant (d = 0.09, 95% CI [-0.133; 0.313]) suggesting that stepped care yields outcomes comparable to standard care including intensive treatments rather than superior clinical effects. Moderator analyses indicated that stepped care effects were largely consistent across patient characteristics, outcomes and methodological qualities. Importantly, stepped care interventions were associated with significantly lower costs compared to control conditions, highlighting their economic advantage. Most studies combined relatively intensive steps, with limited use of self-directed, low-intensity, scalable interventions as initial treatment components. Stepping decisions were primarily based on disorder-specific symptom measures, although some studies incorporated shared decision-making involving clinicians, patients, and families. Exploratory analyses revealed that approximately 46% of the patients transitioned from the initial step, independent of age, and timing of the decision point. Overall, outcomes of stepped care in pediatric psychotherapy appear clinically comparable to usual care while offering substantial cost benefits. The findings support its promise as an efficient service delivery model while underscoring the need for further research on potential barriers and optimal implementation strategies in clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and sustainability have become increasingly intertwined. Understanding the factors that shape public attitudes toward these domains is crucial for fostering responsible adoption. This study examined how personality attributes, generativity concern, sustainability attitudes, demographic characteristics, financial comfort, and parenthood status predict attitudes toward AI among UK adults. A survey of 176 participants (64.2% female; M age = 41.35, SD = 14.19) employed the Personal Attributes Questionnaire, Loyola Generativity Scale, Attitudes Toward Artificial Intelligence Scale, and Sustainability Attitudes Scale.\nMultiple regression analyses indicated that AI attitudes were significantly predicted by male gender (β = .283, p &lt; .001), careful budgeting (β = −.208, p = .019), student status (β = −.193, p = .049), and Asian Indian ethnicity (β = .174, p = .021). Personality attributes did not significantly predict AI attitudes; however, feminine traits were positively associated with sustainability attitudes (β = .353, p &lt; .001). Generativity concern was significantly related to sustainability attitudes (β = .287, p &lt; .001) but showed only a marginal association with AI attitudes (β = .136, p = .072). The final model explained 39.6% of the variance in AI attitudes (R² = .396, p &lt; .001), with demographic variables accounting for 37.1%.\nThese findings suggest that demographic characteristics, rather than personality traits or sustainability attitudes, primarily shape attitudes toward AI, underscoring the importance of demographic diversity and social context in AI development.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated how bilingual experience modulates neural oscillations during spoken language processing as a function of language familiarity. Two groups of English-speaking young adults—monolinguals and simultaneous bilinguals—actively listened to long passages (~30 seconds) in either a familiar (English) or unfamiliar (Hebrew) language while their EEG activity was recorded. To characterize the cognitive processes underpinning spoken language processing, we analyzed spectral power across a broad frequency spectrum (1–80 Hz), spanning delta to gamma bands, and conducted time-frequency analyses to capture neural dynamics during sustained listening. Results revealed that bilingual experience was associated with differential oscillatory patterns, particularly in alpha and theta frequencies. Bilinguals exhibited stronger alpha suppression when processing the unfamiliar language, reflecting experience-dependent engagement of attentional and control-related processes. Additionally, greater home exposure to non-English languages was linked to higher theta power during familiar language processing, consistent with enhanced attention and increased working memory load. Reduced beta power in response to the unfamiliar language suggested limited maintenance of stable representational states and prediction during novel input processing. However, no significant effects were observed in gamma or delta power, nor in the time-frequency analyses. Altogether, these findings suggest that bilingual experience shapes brain responses to spoken language primarily through attention- and memory-related processes. Furthermore, our results underscore the importance of approaching bilingualism as a continuous variable beyond binary categories.",

          "abstract": "Between 2007-2020, implicit and explicit intergroup attitudes declined in bias steadily and were forecasted to continue toward attitude neutrality. New data from 2.5 million U.S. respondents (2021-2024) reveal that these encouraging trends have stalled or reversed. The largest increases in bias emerged for sexuality, transgender, race and skin-tone bias; 10-108% increases on explicit and 6-13% increases on implicit measures. Age, disability, and body weight bias also increased, but at slower rates. Exploratory breakpoint analyses showed that implicit attitudes were leading indicators of change, reversing trend earlier than explicit reports. Reversals were widespread across demographic groups for most topics, though strongest among conservatives for sexuality and transgender biases. Surprisingly, younger respondents (who had previously shown the largest decreases in bias) now showed greater increases in bias. Even after robust bias reduction spanning over 14 years, the new observed bias increases since 2021 highlight how minds get reshaped by sweeping sociocultural change.",

This paper examines the distinct and interconnected influences of power, privilege, and positionality on the defense of meritocratic ideals, with a particular focus on Psychology departments as a context for epistemic and cultural analysis. The paper proposes three orienting principles to guide departments toward greater equity and inclusion: (1) triangulating policies, ideals, and norms through participatory equity; (2) fostering an inclusive climate that values diverse forms of knowledge; and (3) establishing the preconditions for sustainable culture change, including alignment of rewards, acknowledgement of resistance, and measurement of progress. Collectively, these principles offer a practical framework for reconfiguring the academic department towards cultural inclusivity and socially situated scholarship—one that is meaningfully aligned with the overarching mission and civic responsibilities of higher education.",

          "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly changing the way information is conveyed which raises questions about the perception of author competence and message credibility. This study examines the extent to which the type of author (human vs. AI) and the gender of the author (female vs. male) influence the perceived author competence and credibility of a technical text about large language models (LLMs). In a 2×2 between-groups design (N = 219), study participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions. They were either presented with a female or male human author or with a female or male AI author and rated the competence of the author. Then all participants read the same text about LLMs and assessed its credibility. In addition, the participants’ individual attitudes toward AI were recorded as a potential moderator variable. The results show that perceived author competence did not depend on the author’s gender, but on the author type. Human authors were attributed higher competence than AI authors. This effect was moderated by attitudes toward AI: The more positive the attitude, the smaller the competence advantage of human authors. When attitudes toward AI were taken into account as a moderator, a gender effect was also observed for perceived message credibility: Texts by male authors were rated as more credible by AI-skeptical individuals than texts by female authors. This effect decreased with more positive attitudes. The findings illustrate that the perception of author competence and message credibility is influenced by readers’ individual attitudes toward AI.",

Because psychometric models produce numeric quantities that are typically assigned to persons for some purpose, psychometrics is sometimes characterized as a scientific discipline concerned with the practice of psychological measurement. The historical roots of psychometrics come from an interest in the quantitative study of individual differences. Technological advance through the first quarter of the 21st century has led to the development and evaluation of increasingly complex and specialized mathematical models. There can be significant syntactical barriers to understanding these models, making it easy to lose sight of philosophical questions and debates about the meaning and interpretation of the latent variables these models contain.

Results indicate that traditional gender roles persist, with 65% of males exhibiting emotional suppression compared to 23% of females. Societal pressures significantly impact emotional stability, with 77% of females and 42% of males reporting mental exhaustion from overthinking (χ² = 8.7, p &lt; .01). Opinions on feminism and misandry reveal gender polarization, with 68% of females supporting feminism versus 45% of males (χ² = 3.8, p = .05). Compared to past generations, today’s teenagers demonstrate increased emotional awareness but face modern challenges like social media influence.

          "abstract": "Individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) often report difficulties with following conversation topics. It remains unclear how healthy adults manage topic shifts, making it difficult to determine why these abilities break down after TBI. We analyzed conversations from healthy adults and TBI patients, identified topic boundaries, and compared responses following new subtopics (“shift”) versus continuing subtopics (“no shift”) using measures of language production. Across groups, post-shift responses were shorter and simpler (fewer words, verbs, and instances of repetition or rephrasing) and required more planning (more filled pauses), reflecting “shift costs”. TBI patients produced overall shorter and syntactically simpler responses, though shift costs did not differ between groups. Within the TBI group, more severe injuries were associated with smaller shift costs, possibly reflecting reduced sensitivity to topic structure. These findings suggest that the cognitive demands of tracking topic changes affect language production and that these effects are modulated by injury severity.",

(2026) revisit the claim that the motor cortex is engaged in action word and action-sentence processing in a somatotopic fashion, then offer a neural network model simulation of how semantic understanding emerges during word learning based upon this framework. However, the utility of any “brain constrained” model is dependent on the neurobiological plausibility of the effects it is designed to simulate. In this commentary, I argue that multiple sources of evidence, including failures to replicate key findings, demonstrate that semantic processing of action words and action-sentences is unlikely to rely on sensorimotor simulation. Embodied language researchers need to acknowledge the lack of reliable evidence for the semantic somatotopy account and develop alternative models of motor system involvement in language processing that are grounded in reliable effects.",

Adjusting for demographic characteristics, baseline values of the respective outcome, and country fixed effects, regression analyses provided evidence suggesting that those with ‘no pain and a lot of suffering’ had worse subsequent outcomes on two composite measures of wellbeing, several specific indicators of wellbeing, and loneliness than those with ‘a lot of pain and no suffering’.

          "abstract": "Pain is a universal problem, with millions of people around the world experiencing some kind of pain. Despite its importance, rigorous longitudinal evidence on the longer-term effects of pain across various countries remains scarce. This study takes one step toward addressing this gap by examining how pain predicts 56 diverse wellbeing and life-related outcomes using longitudinal data from 22 countries and one territory (N = 207,989). Country-specific regression analyses were conducted, with estimates pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. Adjusting for demographic and childhood factors, we find that pain in Wave 1 negatively predicts flourishing, happiness, life satisfaction, inner peace, mental health, purpose, relationship satisfaction, belonging, orientation to promote good, delayed gratification, hope, gratitude, showing love, physical health, physical exercise, financial and material security, financial comfort, owning home, and being in the top income quintile in Wave 2. Conversely, pain in Wave 1 significantly predicts higher traumatic distress, anxiety, depression, suffering, loneliness, perceived discrimination, health problems, and pain in Wave 2. Pain in Wave 1 has the largest positive effects on subsequent pain, health problems, and suffering, and the largest negative effects on subsequent secure flourishing, mental health, and financial security. This study offers some of the most comprehensive country-wide evidence to date on the potential enduring impact of pain, providing valuable insights for policymakers, healthcare providers, and global organizations focused on reducing health inequalities and enhancing human wellbeing.",

          "abstract": "Prioritizing memories that are motivationally salient is adaptive for goal-directed behavior, ensuring that information being retained is the most relevant to future goals. Past research demonstrates we can use value signals to adaptively modulate our memory. Crucially, however, the timing of value signals varies. Sometimes we know the significance of an upcoming event in advance, while other times, we are unaware of an event’s importance until after the fact. Does the timing of a value signal relative to encoding change the cognitive mechanism by which it shapes memory? To test this question, we developed a motivated encoding task where the motivational cue appeared either before or after encoding. Across two independent samples, pre-encoding motivation improved item memory regardless of test timing, while the benefit of post-encoding motivation only appeared after a 24-hour delay.  For source memory, pre-encoding motivation reliably enhanced performance across conditions. In contrast, the effect of post-encoding motivation on source memory was more variable: it was significant across both test timings in Experiment 2, but was weaker and more variable in Experiment 1. Furthermore, the two conditions differently affected incidental memory organization; pre-encoding motivation enhanced item order memory relative to post-encoding motivation. These results reveal the dissociable effects of pre- and post-encoding motivation, and suggest that when we learn of an event’s importance might determine the mechanism by which we can strengthen its memory for future use.",

          "abstract": "Loneliness, a perceived discrepancy between desired and actual social relationships, shifts cognition in ways that support heightened sensitivity to potential social threat. These cognitive biases are thought to perpetuate loneliness and subsequent long term health risk. One such shift is an increased tendency to assume hostile intent behind others’ ambiguous actions, referred to as a hostile attribution bias. While loneliness has been associated with increased hostile attribution biases, empirical studies have yet to assess whether loneliness causes increased hostile attributions. Here, we tested whether experimentally induced changes in momentary loneliness can shift hostile attribution biases by randomly assigning 142 undergraduate students (ages 18–29 years old) to one of three conditions: a loneliness induction (journaling about a lonely memory), a loneliness reduction (prosocial gratitude), or a control (description of morning routine) condition. As expected, loneliness increased after journaling and decreased after prosocial gratitude. In addition, baseline loneliness was associated with a bias towards hostile attributions. However, acute changes in loneliness did not produce corresponding changes in hostile attribution biases and there was no interaction with baseline loneliness levels. These findings have implications for the design of loneliness interventions, suggesting that targeting momentary feelings of loneliness may have limited effects on some of the maladaptive cognitive biases associated with feelings of loneliness.",

          "abstract": "Relative magnitudes, such as ratios and proportions, are crucial to everyday life. According to the ratio processing system (RPS) theory, ratios across different formats share a common neural code. Prior neuroimaging studies have shown that ratios across different visual formats are processed by overlapping brain areas, thus providing support for this hypothesis. However, overlapping activation found from univariate analyses does not necessarily imply common representations. The aim of this study was to probe the key prediction of the RPS theory by investigating the neural representation of ratios depicted in discrete and continuous magnitudes using multivariate fMRI analyses. Thirty participants completed a delayed ratio comparison task on discrete (sets of dots) and continuous (line lengths) magnitudes while in the MRI scanner. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA), we examined the similarity between ratio representations across high-level variations, such as magnitude type (length and numerosity), and low-level variations, such as variations in line orientation and dot size, throughout the brain, notably in parietal areas. Results did not support a common ratio representation across discrete and continuous magnitudes. Instead, ratios in numerosity and length seemed to be encoded in qualitatively distinct ways. Altogether, results suggest that ratios are not represented in a format-independent way in the brain, thus challenging the RPS theory.",

The Beta-Binomial alternative, examined below for comparison, converts each rating into multiple pseudo-observations by treating scale increments as if they were independent binary trials. Simulation experiments across 500 replications suggest that Dirichlet credible intervals track nominal coverage more closely when panels number fewer than seven, though at the cost of wider intervals.

Importantly, the rewards themselves were all delivered at the end of the study so there was no reason to weight immediate and delayed reward information differently. Instead, we found that our subjects overweighted immediate reward information. Moreover, this bias increased over the course of the experiment and was still present when learning from others’ choices. The gaze data reveal mixed evidence that subjects looked more at immediate vs. delayed feedback, and across subjects, the relative dwell proportion did not predict the behavioral bias. Our results indicate that people prioritize not just immediate rewards, but immediate reward information.

          "abstract": "Although borderline personality disorder (BPD) is more frequently diagnosed among sexual minority individuals than heterosexual individuals, it is unclear the degree to which this disparity reflects differences in symptom expression, diagnostic bias, or some combination of the two. Among treatment-seeking adults with BPD (N = 121, Mage = 28.4; 76% female; 89% White; 57% sexual minority), we examined differential item functioning (DIF) and group differences in symptom severity using self-reported and clinician-administered BPD measures (ZAN-BPD-SR, ZAN-BPD-CR, SCID-5-PD). Although there was no evidence of DIF for any self-reported item, sexual minority participants endorsed self-injurious behaviors (B = .63, p = .01), stress-related paranoia or dissociation (B = .62, p = .01), efforts to avoid abandonment (B = .53, p = .02), and unstable relationships (B = .54, p = .03) more often than heterosexual participants on average, contributing to greater past-week total symptomatology (B = 3.88, p &lt; .01). Clinician-administered items assessing self-injurious behaviors exhibited uniform DIF and were “easier” to endorse for sexual minority participants. Further, assessors rated self-injurious behaviors for sexual minority participants more often over the past week (B = .51, p &lt; .01) and past two years (OR = 3.58, p &lt; .01) than heterosexual participants, and affective instability over the past two years (OR = 4.00, p &lt; .05).

The association between purpose and neurobiomarkers of brain health has been less robust than the association with cognitive outcomes. This research uses the largest sample to date to test the association between purpose in life and four neurobiomarkers of brain health measured from plasma: The Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, p-tau181, neurofilament light (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). We further test whether higher purpose is associated with cognitive resilience against neuropathological burden (i.e., better cognitive performance relative to the amount of neuropathology).\nMethods: Data were from the Health and Retirement Study. Participants (N=4193; Mage=68.87, SD=10.17) reported on their purpose in life and provided venous blood. Biomarkers were assessed using Quanterix’s Simoa platforms. Linear regression tested the association between purpose and the four neurobiomarkers. Residual and interaction-based approaches evaluated cognitive resilience.\nResults: Purpose in life was associated with lower NfL accounting for sociodemographic factors (β=-.06, p&lt;.001). Clinical and behavioral covariates accounted for half of this association, but it persisted (β=-.03, p=.007). Purpose was unrelated to the other three neurobiomarkers. Purpose in life was associated with greater cognitive resilience when tested with the residual approach (β=.11, p&lt;.001) but not the interaction approach (βinteraction=.01, p=.372).\nDiscussion: In the largest sample to date, individuals with more purpose in life had less neuronal injury, as measured with NfL.

          "abstract": "Robots are increasingly joining human teams, where collaboration and competition often coexist, yet their impact on human risk-taking remains unclear. We examined whether collaborating with or competing against a humanoid robot influences risk-taking behavior and performance in an adapted version of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) where participants interacted with a NAO robot. In a pre-registered mixed-design study, we found that social interaction increased risk behavior compared to playing alone. Competition resulted in fewer bursts and higher scores, indicating more efficient strategies, whereas collaboration raised risk without similar gains. Participants in the competition condition more frequently adopted a near-optimal strategy depending on the robot’s behavior. Additional exploratory analysis revealed that women were more risk-averse in collaboration. Our findings demonstrate that social context influences human risk-taking in shared tasks, and present an effective paradigm for studying decision-making in human-robot teams.",

          "authors": "Steven Verheyen; Jonathan Van den Berckt; Tom Heyman",
          "abstract": "This Registered Report pertains to the face-name matching effect (Zwebner et al., 2017) according to which people can match the first name to an unknown target face above chance level. The purpose of the Registered Report was twofold: (i) to perform an independent conceptual replication of the face-name matching effect, and (ii) to establish the nature of the effect. To this end, undergraduate students were presented with uniform pictures of unfamiliar faces of similar age and ethnicity and asked to select these targets’ first names among two alternatives that were equated for length. Half of the trials constituted target trials, in which a face was accompanied by the true name of the depicted person and a filler name. The other half constituted sibling trials, in which a face was accompanied by the name of the same-sex sibling of the depicted person and a filler name. The target trials were meant to establish the generalizability of the face-name matching effect. If participants could reliably match a person’s true name to their face with these homogeneous materials, it would indicate that it is a pervasive effect that extends obvious ethnic, cultural, and zeitgeist differences. The sibling trials were meant to establish whether the effect extends to sibling names. If participants could also reliably match a face and the name of the depicted person’s sibling, it would indicate that we entertain stereotypes for types of names, of which individual names could be regarded tokens. Such a finding would be in line with predictions from the field of socio-onomastics, according to which names are vehicles for social meaning creation that are systematically governed by the socioeconomic characteristics of the name givers. If the face-name matching effect for target trials were to exceed that of sibling trials, this would constitute evidence that names also carry additional, individuating information. Our results provided no conclusive evidence in support of either the face-name matching effect or an analogous effect involving sibling names. Although participants’ accuracy in identifying true names and sibling names slightly exceeded chance, these effects were not statistically significant, and Bayesian analyses yielded inconclusive evidence. Moreover, no significant difference was found between performance on target versus sibling trials, and Bayesian analysis provided evidence in favor of the null hypothesis of no difference. These findings indicate constraints on the generalizability of the face-name matching effect and suggest that its emergence depends on the heterogeneity of the stimulus materials.",

          "abstract": "Face perception dynamically unfolds in three-dimensional space, yet, experimental paradigms predominantly rely on static 2D images, limiting insights into real-world face processing. We conducted a pre-registered study comparing face similarity judgments in static 2D and dynamic 3D conditions using a triplet odd-one-out task in 2,605 participants (yielding data from 323,400 unique trials). Behavioral similarity matrices revealed a strong cross-condition correlation (R2D~3D = 0.93, p &lt; 0.001), suggesting perceptual invariance, that is, consistency across modalities. However, human-aligned sparse (VICE) and deep (VGG-Face) encoding models trained to map face stimuli to behavioral judgments uncovered condition-specific weighting of facial geometry: while chin-cheek distance, eye size, and nose shape dominated similarity judgements in both conditions, face-width-height ratio and upper face length gained more perceptual relevance in 3D. Importantly, the richer information in 3D stimuli significantly reduced choice variance, indicating lower perceptual demand than in 2D during similarity judgements. Employing a representational alignment framework, our approach reveals both shared cognitive processing and representational differences between static 2D and dynamic 3D faces, motivating more naturalistic experimental paradigms which reflect real-world perception. Our open large-scale dataset and encoding models enable further advances in face perception research across biological and computational systems.",

Rewards benefit memory across development, but how reward-associated memories are represented in the brain has not been well characterized. Here we conducted pattern similarity analyses of fMRI data in participants aged 8-25 to elucidate how neural representations in key memory-related brain areas are influenced by reward, and how these relationships change across childhood and adolescence. We found that reward information was reflected in pattern similarity during encoding in ventral temporal cortex and in changes in similarity from encoding to retrieval in anterior hippocampus (aHC). Strikingly, aHC reward-sensitive representations also varied with age such that adults’ memory benefitted from stability of hippocampal representations, whereas younger participants’ memory improvements were associated with greater drift in representations over time. Moreover, across all participants, reward-related univariate activation in the ventral tegmental area was associated with a greater tendency toward representational drift in aHC. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that reward modulates neural memory representations, and that the representational patterns supporting reward-motivated memory shift with age.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between anxious and depressive traits and exploration behavior has been examined in several studies with mixed results. While some studies suggest that anxious and depressive traits are related to avoidance and a decrease in exploratory behaviour, others find the opposite to be true. In our studies, we adopt a multi-armed bandit task in which arms that were spatially close to each other have similar rewards, allowing for generalisation from observed rewards. Furthermore, we introduced risks to simulate costs of over-exploration in the real world. In two studies, we investigate the relationship between transdiagnostic symptoms of anxiety and depression, specifically worrying, and task behaviour. While our first study uses a purely correlational design, our second study involves a psychotherapy-inspired intervention to reduce worries and investigate their causal effect on exploration behaviour. The results suggest that worrying may be a causal factor linking anxious and depressive traits to increased exploration behaviour. Specifically, using computational modelling, we show that worrying is related to an increased preference for novel options, as opposed to mere choice stochasticity. These findings enhance our understanding of the complex links between depression, anxiety and exploration behaviour, and highlight the importance of worry in driving increased exploration.",

This position paper gives a cursory overview of the ways in which HIV stigma impacts cascade of care outcomes, provides guidance for effective stigma reductions interventions, and delineates priorities for understanding and addressing stigma in the HIV response. It makes clear that various forms of stigma deleteriously impact prevention and testing, linkage to care, initiation and adherence to antiretroviral treatment, and viral suppression, and describes stigma reduction methods for public stigma, self-stigma, and structural stigma. It furthermore argues that stigma interventions should be systematically developed, theory- and evidence-based, tailored to context, and codesigned and co-implemented with recipient populations. Lastly, this paper argues for better measurement of stigma, not by seeking consensus on construct definitions and corresponding measures but rather through the transparent reporting of definitions and their operationalizations.",

          "abstract": "Background: Loneliness is increasingly recognized as a major global health concern. As a marker of poor social health, loneliness may emerge when certain aspects of social connection are missing. Yet, it remains unclear to what extent and which features of social connection contribute to a vulnerability of loneliness. In this study, we examined how 24 features of individuals’ social connections spanning structural, functional and quality dimensions predict loneliness both at the same time point and over a two-year follow-up. \n\nMethods: Using fine-grained, tie-specific data from a population-based Dutch cohort aged 18–93 years at baseline (N = 6,852) and at follow-up (N = 3,175), we evaluated which social connection features are predictive of loneliness using random-forest models at both timepoints and across age groups. \n\nFindings: Across both analyses, network quality was the strongest predictor of loneliness. Good-quality and strained relationships, friends-know-family, and network size consistently predicted loneliness. Being in a steady relationship was a top predictor at baseline but less important at follow-up. Functional aspects were generally less predictive. Models explained 24% of baseline and 44% of follow-up variance.\n\nInterpretation: These findings suggest that loneliness is most strongly linked to the quality of one’s social ties rather than their function, and that individuals embedded in low-quality or strained networks are particularly vulnerable. The results also underscore that loneliness is shaped by a broader constellation of factors beyond social connections.",

          "abstract": "Parental ethnotheories, or cultural beliefs and mindsets about child-rearing, are known to shape parenting practices, yet little is known about how these beliefs relate to children’s everyday question-asking. Across two studies using an exploratory sequential mixed-methods design, this research aimed (a) to develop a context-specific measure of parental ethnotheories related to children’s questions and (b) to examine whether these beliefs predict children’s question-asking and parents’ responses.\nIn Study 1, the Parental Ethnotheory Scenarios (PES) were developed based on in-depth interviews with parents from diverse backgrounds (N = 22). Exploratory factor analysis with a larger sample of parents (N = 205) yielded an 11-item, three-factor structure reflecting Social Norms and Compliance, Guided Learning and Autonomy Support, and Regulation of Curiosity and Screen Use. Reliability analyses indicated good internal consistency for the Social Norms and Compliance factor and acceptable consistency for the Guided Learning and Autonomy Support factor. The regulation factor showed low reliability and was retained as two theoretically relevant single items. PES subscales demonstrated expected associations with established parenting goals and child-rearing practices, supporting convergent validity.\nIn Study 2, associations between parental ethnotheories, children’s questions, and parents’ responses were examined using mixed-effects models (N = 148). Parents endorsing autonomy-supportive beliefs were more likely to have children who asked fact-seeking questions and were more likely to provide elaborative responses. In contrast, parents emphasizing compliance-oriented beliefs tended to provide shorter and less informative responses, and greater difficulty with frequent questioning was associated with fewer fact-seeking questions. Together, these findings demonstrate that context-specific parental ethnotheories represent a valid and meaningful construct that predicts real-world parent–child question–answer interactions.",

          "abstract": "The ability to generalize previously learned knowledge to novel situations is fundamental for adaptive behavior, including interpreting unfamiliar compositional words. To investigate how people construct novel meanings based on structural rules, we developed a semi-artificial language paradigm that combines explicit meaning judgments with implicit semantic priming measures, allowing us to assess rule-based composition across multiple behavioral levels. Participants learned pseudo-words composed of known stems and unknown affixes, and were subsequently tested on novel combinations that required generalizing abstract structural rules. Across three behavioral experiments, we found reliable evidence for generalization on both implicit and explicit measures, yet these measures diverged in sensitivity. Critically, individuals differed in the degree to which they relied on the sequential order of word parts: Some employed a “building” strategy that integrated parts positionally, while others adopted a “mixing” strategy that ignored order. We further explored whether this variability could be explained by individual differences in stable trait factors. Together, this work offers a methodologically integrated approach for studying compositional meaning construction and provides an experimentally controlled paradigm suitable for future neuroimaging research on rule-based inference.",

          "authors": "Valerie van Mulukom",
          "abstract": "This article proposes a dual-self states framework to demonstrate how phenomenology and neuroscience of embodied and altered states of consciousness illuminate the nature of consciousness and the sense of self. It argues that consciousness is best conceived as dynamic configurations of a reflective and an experiential self state, rather than as static, taxonomic layers of self. The reflective self corresponds to narrative, denotational, and self-referential consciousness underpinned by default mode network activity, whereas the experiential self is characterised as an embodied, affective-salience mode of perspectival awareness supported by salience network hubs, especially anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex, integrating interoceptive and exteroceptive signals into a coherent sense of “being here” as subject of experience. Within a predictive processing and dopaminergic framework, the experiential self state is construed as a mode in which precision-weighted affective and bodily prediction errors structure ongoing meta-aware experience, rather than non-conscious processing or contentless nondual awareness. Altered states, particularly such as examined in meditation research, provide further evidence of the processes involved in shifting to, and maintaining, the experiential self state, and how these processes may be practiced and developed. The framework yields testable predictions for neurocomputational modelling and longitudinal studies, positioning self-transcendent and related altered states as useful entry points for investigating how reflective and experiential modes of consciousness are distinct, and how experiential consciousness is embodied, pertains to salience processing, and is expressed in affective engagement with the world.",

          "abstract": "Importance: Despite 2 million adolescents (aged 12-17) in the United States having a substance use disorder (SUD), little is known regarding where they seek behavioral healthcare (e.g., mental health treatment, substance use treatment, or both). Adolescents have higher rates of co-occurring major depressive episodes (MDEs) than adults with SUDs, which may increase their use of mental health services. Understanding where adolescents with SUDs enter behavioral treatment is crucial to ensure adequate workforce preparedness to care for them where they seek help.\nObjective: To determine where adolescents with SUDs, with or without co-occurring MDE, present to behavioral health treatment. \nDesign: This was a secondary data analysis of a cross-sectional nationally representative survey.\nSetting: The National Survey on Drug Use and Health for adolescents (2022-2023). Data were analyzed between October 2025 and December 2025.\nParticipants: A sample of 24,541 adolescents between the ages of 12-17 from the United States of America. \nExposures: Treatment setting, SUD diagnosis, past year substance use, MDE diagnosis, adolescent age, biological sex, race and ethnicity, insurance status, household income, and study year. \nMain Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Behavioral health treatment setting (i.e., mental health treatment, substance use treatment, both, or none) among adolescents with a SUD. \nResults: Adolescents with a SUD were significantly more likely to engage in mental health (34.7% [95% CI: 30.9-38.8%]) than SU treatment (18.6% [95% CI: 15.8-21.8%], F1,50=62.2, p&lt;.001). Similarly, adolescents with co-occurring SUD and MDE were significantly more likely to engage in mental health (70.7% [95% CI: 65.6-75.3%]) than SU treatment (21.2% [95% CI: 17.5-25.5%], F1,50=43.7, p&lt;.001). Minoritized adolescents with a SUD (aPR = 0.82 [95% CI: 0.71-0.94], p = .007) were less likely, while female respondents with a SUD (aPR = 1.22 [95% CI: 1.07-1.40], p=.006) were more likely to receive any treatment. \nConclusions and Relevance: This study found that adolescents with a SUD were twice as likely, and adolescents with co-occurring SUD and MDE over three times more likely, to engage in mental health compared to substance use treatment. Clinically, these results suggest mental health treatment may serve as a critically important touchpoint to treat adolescents with SUDs.",

          "abstract": "Background: Accurate emotion processing is crucial for social development. Preterm birth is associated with neurodevelopmental alterations and increased vulnerability to subtle socio-emotional difficulties, often described within the preterm behavioral phenotype. Previous studies have reported impaired emotion recognition in preterm populations, but have largely relied on behavioral tasks and primarily focused on facial expressions. Because explicit emotion recognition is still developing in early childhood, objective neural markers of implicit emotion discrimination may be particularly informative for early detection.\nMethods: We administered a series of frequency-tagging electroencephalography (EEG) paradigms to investigate neural sensitivity to brief changes in emotional expressions in a cohort of five-year-old preterm children (N = 66), and age-matched full-term peers (N = 32). Frequency-tagging EEG utilizes fast periodic stimulation to elicit synchronized brain responses measurable in the frequency domain. Neural sensitivity to changes in emotional expressions was examined in both the visual and auditory modality, using oddball paradigms with neutral faces or voices presented at base frequency and emotional expressions (either fearful or happy) presented as periodic oddballs. Linear mixed models were used to investigate the effects of group, emotion, and prematurity severity.\nResults: All children showed implicit neural discrimination between neutral and emotional expressions. Compared to full-term peers, children born very preterm (≤32 weeks of gestation) showed reduced neural sensitivity to both facial and vocal emotion expression changes. Children born moderate-to-late preterm (33-36 weeks of gestation) also showed reduced neural sensitivity, but only for vocal expressions. Across modalities, reduced neural sensitivity to happy emotional expressions was associated with higher parent-reported social difficulties. \nConclusions: Five-year-old children born preterm show reduced neural sensitivity to brief changes in facial and vocal emotional expressions compared with full-term peers. Strikingly, the impact of prematurity severity differed between the visual and auditory modalities, indicating differential maturation of higher-level visual and auditory processing following preterm birth. These findings contribute to a more detailed understanding of socio-emotional development after preterm birth and highlight the importance of early, modality-sensitive monitoring of socio-emotional development across the entire preterm population.",

Accurate perception is necessary for knowing about climate change and for guiding a collective response. We identify three theoretical challenges for a climate-oriented perceptual psychology. (1) The knowledge problem: changes in the Earth’s climate are typically not directly perceivable, but are perceived via cognitive technologies such as scientific models, which introduce uncertainties. (2) The feedback problem: human action aimed at improving the Earth’s climate is necessary, but difficult to control, and potentially with unforeseeable side-effects. (3) The collective action problem: coordinating a response to climate breakdown is a collective challenge, demanding agreement on the epistemic basis of future action. These three challenges indicate the need for renewed theorizing about indirect knowledge and about action coordination and social decision-making under uncertainty.

          "abstract": "In tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) like Dungeons &amp; Dragons, players act not as themselves but as a fictional character in a fantasy world. Often this involves making in-game choices based not on what the player would like to do but what the player believes the character would do, i.e. perspective taking. It has been speculated that role-playing might enhance the ability to understand others’ perspectives, but no rigorous quantitative work on the hypothesis has yet been conducted. In a survey of over 300 experienced TTRPG players, greater time spent role-playing characters that are markedly more different from one’s self was significantly associated with higher scores on the perspective-taking subscale of the Interpersonal reactivity Index. This association persisted even when a measure of autistic traits (the AQ) was included in the same model. These results suggest that there is value in future work investigating a potential causative role for TTRPG experience in enhancing perspective taking and add to the evidence that the ability to understand others’ mental states might be flexible even in adulthood.",

          "abstract": "Adaptability and flexible error correction are essential to interact with dynamic environments. However, previously learned automatic motor patterns can hinder performance under altered task demands, producing a “habit lag.” Mirror-reversal tasks provide a model for studying de novo motor learning, requiring suppression of prior motor plans and the formation of new mappings. Additionally, research in error correction of continuous mirror-inverted paradigms with high-resolution neural and behavioral measures remain scarce. Here, we introduce the Flow Task, a modified target-jump mouse-based reaching paradigm with left-right inversion, designed to probe error detection, correction, and conscious awareness, ultimately designed for seasoned meditators. Importantly, we present the Flow Task as an open-access, fully documented platform that includes the complete analysis pipeline and example datasets. For this preliminary study, twenty participants performed reaching movements under normal and reversed conditions while mouse kinematics were recorded at 100 Hz. We developed an algorithm to detect trajectory breaks, providing temporal anchors for future EEG analyses and microphenomenology inquiry. Primary outcomes included reaction time (RT), trigger-to-target time (TTargT), and movement breaks. Results showed marked increases in RT, TTargT, and trajectory breaks during mirror reversal, reflecting the heightened cognitive demands and explicit strategy use characteristic of de novo learning, with partial improvement across blocks but no return to baseline performance. This study demonstrates the validity of the Flow Task as a multimodal tool for probing flexible motor control and conscious error detection. By combining continuous kinematics with neural and phenomenological measures, this paradigm enables high-resolution investigation of when errors are registered, corrected, and brought into awareness.",

Bridging insights from developmental, social, and educational psychology, we hypothesized that children endorse a stereotype that portrays children from low-SES backgrounds as more hardworking than smart—and that children acquire this stereotype, in part, through their parents. We tested this in a within-subjects experiment (October 2021, the Netherlands) involving children (N = 251, aged 8–13, 52% girls, 48% boys) and one of their parents (aged 29–59, 58% women, 42% men). As hypothesized, children perceived peers from low-SES backgrounds as more hardworking than intelligent. They attributed these peers’ success more to hard work than intelligence, and failure more to a lack of intelligence than a lack of hard work. Parents held similar stereotypes. Children’s stereotypes correlated with their parents’ (standardized coefficient = 0.31). Children had stronger stereotypes when their parents had higher SES or stronger essentialist beliefs about SES (i.e., beliefs that SES is easily discerned, stable, and rooted in biology). These associations did not depend on children’s age. Together, results reveal an early emerging stereotype, partially shared between parents and children, that portrays children from low-SES backgrounds as more hardworking than smart. Cultural narratives that provide seemingly positive portrayals of low-SES individuals as primarily hardworking might reflect and reinforce this stereotype.",

          "abstract": "Face identity recognition is a core function of the human brain, predominantly driven by horizontally-oriented facial cues. The reference frame of the (horizontal) information driving human face identification has not been systematically addressed. Therefore, a core characteristic of human face identity recognition remains undefined.\nThe reference frame of the horizontal information driving face identification may be centered either on the observer’s retina (i.e. retina-centered), or the face stimulus (i.e. face-centered). To disentangle these alternatives, 42 young adults performed identity recognition of famous faces. Stimuli were filtered to restrict content to narrow orientation bands (i.e., from 0° to 150°, in 30°-steps), and presented either upright, rotated by ±45°, or by ±90° away from upright. If the horizontal face identity information is defined along retinal coordinates, the peak of identification performance should shift away from horizontal (90°) as a function of rotation angle (peak shift from 90° to 135° for a +45° rotation). In contrast, a reference frame centered on the face identity recognition performance should stay tuned to the horizontal irrespective of rotation angle.\nOverall performance significantly decreased when faces were rotated by ±90° compared to other rotation angles. Recognition performance peaked in the horizontal range of the face stimulus regardless of rotation angle. However, the advantage of the horizontal over the vertical range decreased significantly for ±90° compared to upright and ±45° rotations suggesting partial dependence on the retina-centered reference frame. These results indicate that the horizontal information driving human face-specialized identity recognition is defined within the reference frame of the face-image.",

          "authors": "Temenuzhka Dimova; Nicolas Lapique; Raphael Rosenberg",
          "abstract": "We studied the perception of 16th- and 17th-century narrative paintings in three distinct groups: Deaf Sign Language users (ÖGS), Art History Experts, and Lay viewers. By combining eye-tracking data with open interviews, we aimed to test whether Deaf signers and art Experts would exhibit similar viewing behaviors due to their enhanced visual skills. We found that, despite lacking formal training in art history, Deaf viewers displayed oculometric patterns closely resembling those of Experts. These included shorter fixation durations, broader exploration of the pictorial surface, and increased attention to semantically meaningful elements such as symbolic objects and codified hand gestures. Both Deaf participants and Experts also used more concrete and detailed language to describe the paintings, in contrast to Lay viewers, who tended to offer more general and vague statements. Additionally, Deaf participants exhibited a distinctive pattern when viewing faces, focusing more on the mouth area than the eyes, likely due to visual habits of speech perception. These findings suggest a perceptual overlap between two populations with distinct cultural backgrounds and sensory experiences. Sign language mastery and early deafness may enhance visual perception and image interpretation. The results have broader implications for cognitive science, art history, and Deaf studies, demonstrating the value of cross-domain expertise in understanding human perception. They also support the inclusion of Deaf individuals in art history and museum careers, aligning with the concept of Deaf Gain.",

          "abstract": "Research into language disorders such as aphasia and what they can reveal about the cognitive and neural underpinnings of language should be informed by crosslinguistic descriptions. It is particularly important to include languages that are highly dissimilar to widely studied languages like English. Kalaallisut (West Greenlandic) is one such language – a polysynthetic language of the Inuit-Yupik-Unangan language family spoken by approximately 60,000 people in Greenland and Denmark. A previous study of five Kalaallisut speakers with aphasia (Nedergaard et al., 2020) indicated that non-fluent aphasia in Kalaallisut exhibited different features from those found in English and similar Indo-European languages. However, the previous study was limited by its low number of participants, its focus only on semispontaneous speech narratives, and the fact that a more complete description of aphasia in Kalaallisut was not available. An essential prerequisite for incorporating data from an underresearched language in aphasiology is having sufficient information to reliably identify speakers with aphasia in that language. Gaining such information was the main aim of the present study where we tested a total of 42 speakers of Kalaallisut on repetition tests, language production tests, language comprehension tests, and working memory tests. We used a combination of qualitative judgments by a speech and language pathologist and hierarchical cluster analysis to analyze the results and were able to distinguish between presence or absence of aphasia, between levels of severity of aphasia, between apraxia of speech/dysarthria and aphasia, and to some extent between different aphasia subtypes.",

However, after many decades of research, the evidence for a birth order effect is scarce at best. Less is known about the role of birth order for social relationships, in particular romantic relationships. This paper re-examines a previously reported finding that firstborns report less romantic jealousy than laterborns. We present data from four samples (total n &gt; 950) with a MANOVA design, mirroring the study on which this original claim was based. Across all samples and multiple robustness checks, we found no statistical support for the claim that firstborns report less jealousy than laterborns. Both frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses did not support a birth order effect on jealousy (frequentist estimate:  r = .08, 95% CI [-.018, .172]). These findings challenge the notion of birth order as a significant predictor for romantic jealousy and suggest that research on romantic relationships may yield greater insight by focussing on other individual difference variables than birth order.",

Human-only screening can introduce inconsistency, while fully automated approaches employing Large Language Models often lack the contextual judgement required for complex decisions. To address this, we introduce a crowd-based screening methodology that integrates human expertise with adaptive machine learning. The methods have been applied in the context of a large EU project where experts from 27 collaborating partners jointly screened 5,842 papers across eleven disease topics related to patient-generated health data in a span of only 2 days. Post-processing played a central role in ensuring data quality, including topic reallocation, targeted full-text verification, and noisy-label filtering. This Screenathon resulted in 487 records being labeled as relevant and 6,463 records as irrelevant. The number of records screened per participant ranged from 3 to 2,496, with a mean of 216.4 records per screener (SE = 95.19). Survey results indicated increased trust in AI-assisted systematic reviewing after the event, along with generally positive evaluations of usability. The current Screenathon demonstrates that human–AI collaboration can increase efficiency while maintaining rigor, provided that workflows include thoughtful training and calibration together with strong post-processing safeguards.",

This study jointly analyzes item responses and response times from 1,467 adults taking the nine core subtests of the Reasoning and Intelligence Online Test (RIOT; https://riotiq.com). Using a joint hierarchical model of responses and response times, results indicated good model fit across subtests, with weak correlations between examinee ability and examinee tempo for verbal tasks (r = -.204 to .309) and stronger negative correlations for visuospatial tasks (r = -.508 to -.774), supporting predictions from dual process theory. Item intensity positively correlated with response times with difficulty on most subtests, indicating that item characteristics were the cause of longer response times for more difficult items. Few examinees (2.5%) exhibited dual misfit in responses and times, but the Figure Weights subtest revealed anomalous slow responding. Findings are consistent with tempo (i.e., examinee response times) being largely independent of cognitive ability, with observed correlations influenced by item characteristics.

To tap such reasoning, two questionnaires were recently developed: one assessed justifications in gambling behavior, and one assessed permissive beliefs in other addictive behaviors, separating two constructs of deserving reward and defensive optimism. In this preregistered cross-sectional study, we compared these constructs in their associations with problem gambling severity, and with theoretically-related constructs – metacognition, reflection, and self-control – among 292 participants with gambling experience recruited from an online crowdsourcing platform. Justifications and Deserving Reward, but not Defensive Optimism, were positively correlated with Problem Gambling Severity Index at a bivariate level. Supporting our prediction, in our multiple regression model, Justifications were positively associated with Problem Gambling Severity Index. In this model, Deserving Reward did not reach significance and Defensive Optimism showed a negative association. Justifications, Deserving Reward, and Defensive Optimism were 1) not strongly explained by metacognition, reflection, nor self-control, and 2) appear as distinct constructs as indicated by psychometric modelling. Our findings indicate that justifications and permissive beliefs, despite their conceptual similarity, show different relationships with gambling severity.

In Study 1, 52 university students rated 100 two-kanji Japanese words as “intellectual,” “non-intellectual,” or “neutral.” Based on high agreement, we selected 20 intellectual and 10 non-intellectual words to construct the iFUMIE test. In Study 2, we evaluated its reliability and validity using the target words “understanding” and “ignorance,” with 51 students. Results confirmed the test’s usability in measuring implicit intellectual associations.

Coastal avian mortality events in Peru have been widely reported in the mass media, but the framing of these events and their implications for public mental health remain underexplored. This study examines how Peruvian news media frame coastal wildlife mortality events, identifies dominant narratives, and assesses their potential impact on public understanding and emotional responses to ecological emergencies.\nMethods: We employed the LISTEN method, a structured approach integrating digital text analysis with stakeholder discussions and qualitative content analysis. From an initial dataset of 1,113 Peruvian news articles, we selected 80 articles that explicitly referenced mass wildlife mortality in coastal regions. Our study utilised both computational text analysis (using InfraNodus) and collaborative thematic coding.\nFindings: News articles primarily framed wildlife mortality events through human-centric lenses, emphasising zoonotic threats to the human population over ecological concerns. Government responses were frequently focused on preventing the spread of infections, limiting broader ecological discussions. However, the public did worry about the animals’ wellbeing, and experts cautioned about the implications of these events for biodiversity loss.\nConclusion: Our analysis highlights how media framing can shape public discourse around environmental health crises. By prioritising anthropocentric narratives, news coverage may limit broader ecological understanding and public engagement with complex environmental challenges. Our findings underscore the need for more nuanced, balanced reporting that integrates ecological perspectives with context-rich crisis communication to foster a deeper public understanding of environmental crises.",

          "abstract": "The use of supportive touch in psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) and MDMA-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) presents unique ethical challenges and opportunities. While touch can be a valuable component of treatment, its implementation requires careful consideration due to the altered states of consciousness induced by psychedelics and the potential for boundary violations. This paper addresses a critical gap in existing protocols by proposing a comprehensive, conservative model for the ethical implementation of supportive touch within PAT. Our framework features: (1) a structured two-stage consent-assent process distinguishing between permission obtained in ordinary consciousness and psychedelic sessions, (2) a range of touch options with clear categories and boundaries, (3) protocols for ongoing assessment of touch experiences, and (4) practical alternatives when touch is contraindicated. Drawing from clinical experience and ethical principles, we provide specific guidelines for discussing touch during preparation, administration, and integration sessions. The model emphasizes cultural sensitivity, power dynamics, and individual differences while prioritizing client autonomy and safety. We discuss limitations of our approach and suggest directions for future research and the development of specialized training programs. By offering pragmatic guidelines that balance therapeutic potential with ethical constraints, this paper contributes to the development of evidence-based practices in psychedelic-assisted therapy.",

          "abstract": "Given we cannot remember all our experiences, it seems intuitive that we should prioritize events of consequence, like those that lead to a reward. However, rewards have had inconsistent effects on people’s memory for preceding neutral experiences in experiments, raising questions as to whether our minds are equipped to remember adaptively. Here, we will use online testing in a registered report to investigate whether rewards tend to retroactively enhance certain types of memories. Consistent with prior research and theories involving how dopamine modulates the hippocampus, we hypothesize that reward retroactively enhances memory in a delay-dependent manner, emerging only after a period of consolidation. Crucially, we further predict that this long-delay modulation of memory will be stronger for associative memory than for item recognition—a factor not previously considered despite its clear theoretical grounding. This work will answer important open questions about the mechanisms by which reward retroactively enhances memory, elucidating the conditions under which this key aspect of adaptive memory emerges.",

          "abstract": "Well-being is often defined in terms of a person’s comfort, happiness, functioning and flourishing. Scholars distinguish subjective well-being (i.e., perceiving one’s life as pleasant) from psychological well-being (i.e., perceiving one’s life as meaningful). Advances in natural language processing have yielded automated assessments of psychological states and traits from language alone, including subjective well-being. However, the strength of these tools for assessing psychological well-being remains unstudied. Across three studies (one preregistered), we examined the strength of language-based assessments of self-reported subjective and psychological well-being components. Participants gave verbal or written responses to queries regarding their satisfaction with life and autonomy, along with questionnaire measures of subjective and psychological well-being. We then tested the strength of contextual word embeddings generated from AI-based transformers applied to verbal responses in predicting self-reported satisfaction with life and psychological well-being. Predictions generated from word embeddings of open-ended assessments correlated significantly with questionnaire measures of corresponding well-being constructs (rs = .16 &lt; r &lt; .63) and they also generalized across well-being components (rs = .15 &lt; r &lt; .50). However, the strength of these relations was lower than previous studies (rs = .72 &lt; r &lt; .85), and sense of autonomy was consistently less predictable than satisfaction with life. These findings demonstrate that although linguistic measures can significantly correlate with one’s sense of autonomy, it appears to be more challenging to assess than other forms of well-being.",

Participants with three to 11 years of auditory experience completed a tablet-based sentence-picture matching task. CHL predominantly relied on an agent-first strategy, showing accurate comprehension of simple subject-verb-object sentences and subject relatives, but persistent difficulties with object topicalization, passives, and object relatives. CTH showed progress along the age range examined, with older children usually achieving comprehension of all structures except object relatives. Data-driven k-means clustering supported the theoretical profiles.

The present investigation is among the first to extend this theory to Brazil.

Results showed that the Relevance subscale demonstrated good reliability, model fit, and cross-cultural invariance, whereas the Judgment subscale demonstrated acceptable reliability but weaker and less stable properties. In Study 2 (N = 590), we examined discriminant and concurrent validity using a Brazilian general population sample. The Relevance subscale again demonstrated good reliability and measurement invariance across Brazilian and U.S. samples, whereas the Judgment subscale once more showed acceptable reliability but persistent psychometric instability. Together, these findings suggest that Morality-As-Cooperation offers a useful framework for studying morality in Brazil and beyond, although refinement of the Judgment subscale is needed to ensure robust cross-cultural applications.",

This study examines the predictive validity of risk preference for various life events (i.e., selection effects) and the role of life events in shaping risk preference (i.e., socialization effects). Using a large representative sample from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP; N = 14,558), we employed propensity score matching to construct synthetic treatment and control groups—individuals experiencing (or not experiencing) a life event—while controlling for various confounding variables. We then evaluated the extent to which general and domain-specific measures of risk preference predict the occurrence of 12 life events related to family transitions (e.g., marriage) and professional development (e.g., self-employment), as well as how these life events shape risk preference. Our findings provide evidence for selection effects by demonstrating that risk preference significantly predicts the occurrence of various life events. Furthermore, the predictive utility of risk preference generalizes across domains, with general or composite measures demonstrating somewhat superior predictive power relative to domain-specific ones. In turn, after adjusting for selection bias, socialization effects were negligible, with most life events showing no significant association with changes in risk preference. Overall, our results suggest that while risk preference has broad predictive power across various life areas, life events have a limited influence on shaping it. These findings reinforce the predominance of selection effects and underscore the importance of carefully distinguishing between selection and socialization processes.",

The current research offers an explanation for this: causal beliefs only predict policy attitudes when they are specific and correspond with the policy. We test this across 6 studies (N = 10,728). In Study 1 we test whether specific-corresponding beliefs are stronger correlates of policy support than other causal beliefs. In Study 2 we test whether communicating specific-corresponding causal evidence can increase policy support. In Study 3 we analyse three existing datasets to identify a psychological mechanism: perceived policy effectiveness. Studies 4a-b extend the causal evidence from Study 2 and the mechanism from Study 3. Study 5 involves a meta-analysis of the experimental studies. This provides support for our theory: specific-corresponding causal beliefs affect policy support, but general and non-corresponding causal beliefs do not.",

          "abstract": "Bondage, Discipline, Sadism, and Masochism (BDSM) is a range of diverse sexual practices. Stigma regarding BDSM is associated with dysfunctional personalities, insecure attachment styles, or damaged well-being. Previous studies have shown contrary evidence to these views. However, the replicability of these findings has not been properly studied. The present research provides a close replication study to test differences in personality, attachment, rejection sensitivity, and well-being between BDSM practitioners and non-practitioners. To overcome limitations in previous studies, this study provides a highly powered sample of a new population (Spanish, N = 1,907), including effect sizes, the presence and impact of LGTBIQA+ individuals, and assessing BDSM roles using an alternative classification. In addition, we explored differences in associations between attachment styles, personality, and well-being in BDSM practitioners. As predicted, BDSM practitioners showed higher levels of secure attachment, conscientiousness, openness, and well-being while also lower levels of insecure attachments, rejection sensitivity, neuroticism, and agreeableness, countering the stigma. Gender, sexual orientations, and experience with BDSM showed explanatory potential. Associations between attachment, personality, and well-being were invariant across BDSM practitioners and non-practitioners but also across BDSM roles. This is, BDSM practitioners share the same psychological structure as non-practitioners but also show more functional profiles. Thus, de-stigmatizing BDSM populations is reinforced and recommended. Limitations and implications for applied and research audiences are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Intro: Many people with bipolar disorder (BD) experience persistent cognitive deficits. Sleep spindles have been linked to cognitive ability in healthy populations and psychotic disorders. While there is preliminary evidence for altered spindle activity in BD, research directly examining the association between sleep spindle parameters and cognitive performance in this population is lacking. Therefore, our primary objective was to examine the association between fast spindle density and episodic memory performance in euthymic individuals with BD, hypothesising a positive relationship. As exploratory analyses, we looked at associations between fast and slow spindle density and subjective sleep quality with other cognitive domains. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis, separating all analyses by lithium intake. \nMethods: Thirty-four euthymic participants with BD underwent comprehensive cognitive assessments and were assessed for three consecutive nights using mobile sleep-EEG headbands. Sleep spindles were detected using validated, adapted, fully automated algorithms, subdivided into slow (≤13 Hz) and fast (&gt;13 Hz) spindles, and characterised by density. \nResults: Contrary to our hypothesis, fast spindle density was not associated with episodic memory performance (r=-.004, p=.491, 95% CI [-.353, .499]) but did show a significant positive association with working memory in exploratory analyses (r=.423, p=.014, 95% CI [-.167, .722]). When removing participants taking lithium from analyses, several positive significant associations emerged between fast spindle density and cognitive performance.\nConclusions: These findings suggest domain-specific relationships between sleep spindle activity and cognition in BD, with fast spindles potentially being associated with working memory. Preliminary evidence for lithium-related modulation highlights the importance of considering pharmacological factors. However, the analyses were underpowered, and large-scale studies are needed to deepen our understanding of sleep spindle-cognition relationships in BD.\n\nKeywords: bipolar disorder; cognition; episodic memory; working memory; sleep spindles; sleep-EEG; lithium",

          "abstract": "People Pleasing refers to a tendency to prioritize the needs and goals of others over the own needs and goals, which arguably goes along with a manifold of psychological consequences for individuals high in people pleasing. In two preregistered studies involving students and community members alike (n1 = 571, n2 = 1,323), a 10-item People Pleasing Scale was developed and validated. Study 1 revealed three dimensions of people pleasing, namely Responsibility, Neglect of Own Needs, and Others’ Expectations. This structure was confirmed in Study 2. Residual measurement invariance across genders was found in both independent datasets. Analyses of the nomological networks and similarities thereof revealed that people pleasing, as measured with the People Pleasing Scale, was positively correlated with yet distinguishable from facets of agreeableness, honesty-humility, emotionality, empathy, and negatively correlated yet distinguishable from subclinical psychopathy. Furthermore, people pleasing went along with charitable giving in the ultimatum game and the dictator game, and with a social value orientation. The findings underscore the uniqueness of the people construct as measured with the People Pleasing Scale and its merit for scientific and applied purposes. Outlooks for future applications of the people pleasing construct and the devised measurement tool are outlined.",

This directional asymmetry in self-projection systematically favors the future, is robust across nine countries and different time horizons, and extends to goals and preferences. Higher levels of emotional connection between present and future selves and lower levels of perceived future self-change mediate this future-oriented self-projection, and we also provide causal evidence for perceived change as a mechanism by experimentally manipulating beliefs about future self-change. Finally, we reveal that future-oriented self-projection can lead to miscalibrated expectations: People expect their future selves to be more satisfied with decisions made in the present than they currently would be with similar decisions made in the past.

          "abstract": "Across four studies (total n = 2,042, two preregistered, one partly preregistered), we investigated the degree to which experiences in psychological experiments may arise from participants controlling their experience to satisfy their goals, i.e., phenomenological control (PC). Trait PC has previously been shown to predict some experimental measures of changes in experience when demand characteristics are not controlled. Here, we investigated the reach of PC as a demand effect by contrasting relationships between Phenomenological Control Scale scores (PCS; a test of direct imaginative suggestion) and effects presumed to either be sensitive to beliefs (visually evoked auditory response or vEAR; tingling in the scalp or ASMR) or insensitive to beliefs (the Müller Lyer illusion; the vertical-horizontal illusion). PC accounted for much of the effect for the posited belief-sensitive effects but not for the classic visual illusions (Study 1). This pattern of results remained after controlling for context effects (Study 2) and measurement differences across procedures (Study 3). Finally, we present the first causal evidence that the two established psychological effects which are predicted by PC (vEAR and ASMR) can be modulated by participants high in PC in accordance with demand characteristics delivered by direct suggestion (Study 4). PC may account for the effects of psychological experiments when an effect is sensitive to belief, but not where it is not. This presents a previously unrecognised threat to validity in psychology experiments analogous to that of placebo effects in medicine.",

          "abstract": "Recent experience sampling research on affective functioning has emphasized the importance of short-term dynamics, yet rarely evaluates whether momentary measures are better explained by stable individual differences or by within-individual fluctuations. To address this issue, we (1) decomposed the variance in momentary affect explained by rumination across the between- and within-person levels, and (2) compared the predictive validity of state-based (mean state) and global (trait) self-report rumination measures of between-person differences. Our sample comprised 247 individuals who received eight questionnaires every day for up to 28 days, assessing their momentary affective states and emotion regulation, yielding 14,265 observations. Our results showed that rumination indices explained 2–3 times more variance in momentary negative affect at the between-individual level than at the within-individual level. Mean state rumination and global self-reports were only moderately correlated, and the former explained roughly twice as much variance of negative affect. For positive affect, both predictors conveyed similar, weak predictive validity. These findings suggest that longer-term tendencies in emotion regulation are more relevant predictors of affect than momentary fluctuations. We propose that aggregated momentary measures may capture individual differences with greater validity than global self-reports, emphasizing the importance of accounting for timescale in experience sampling research.",

          "abstract": "Humans readily categorize their social environment based on visible features regarded as diagnostic for group membership (e.g., skin color, hair color, body morphology) along lines of various social dimensions, including gender, race, age, to name just a few. Despite overwhelming evidence for the notion that these dimensions can be used to bring categorical order into the world, psychologists know surprisingly little about what determines which of these lenses is active in a given moment. The present research examines whether ecological meta-contrast provides an affordance to social categorization and selective category use. Across seven studies (N = 1,234), we manipulated meta-contrast ratios by varying the dispersion of race- and gender-related facial features to examine their effects on spontaneous social categorization. Categorization was assessed using the “Who Said What?” paradigm (Taylor et al., 1978), with categorization parameters estimated via multinomial processing tree (MPT) models (Klauer &amp; Wegener, 1998), and a Speeded Categorization task (Thomas et al., 2014). Participants consistently categorized faces by race (Studies 1a, 2a) and gender (Studies 1b, 2b), regardless of meta-contrast ratio. However, when race and gender were crossed (Studies 3, 4, 5), significant interaction effects emerged: categorization along the low meta-contrast dimension decreased, while it increased along the high-meta-contrast dimension. These findings provide initial evidence that meta-contrast modulates the relative accessibility of social categorizations. The distribution of category-related features within a social information ecology thus provides affordance to some categorizations more readily than others. Study-specific patterns related to stimuli and task constraints are discussed to inform future research.",

          "abstract": "Learning about danger through exposure to harmful events relies on Pavlovian conditioning, which enables individuals to prepare for potential threats when encountering the same or similar warning signals in the future. Yet Pavlovian threat memories alone cannot explain defensive behavior in situations where such cues are absent. Here, we tested whether Pavlovian learning interacts with prior neutral memories acquired across multiple episodes, such that the relational structure among these memories guides defensive responses to cues never experienced in an aversive context. Participants first learned overlapping pairs of neutral images that together formed an abstract linear graph. The following day, the two images located at opposite ends of the graph were differentially paired with mild electric shocks through conditioning, thereby establishing them as threat and safety signals. When later exposed to the remaining images under risk of shock, participants exhibited graded defensive responses across self-report and physiological measures that scaled with the mnemonic proximity of each image to the shock-predictive image. These findings suggest that adaptive defense can arise from the interaction of Pavlovian associations with a pre-existing relational memory structure formed across neutral episodes, allowing individuals to prepare for danger even in situations beyond directly learned threats.",

          "abstract": "The Knowledge-Learning-Instruction (KLI) framework is a cognitive framework describing the causal interplay between knowledge, learning, and instruction. It has an explicit cross-domain scope and has had considerable impact in the learning sciences. Despite this, to the best of our knowledge, it has not yet been applied in research on instructed second language (L2) learning. This is notable because, although L2 research is sometimes siloed within the learning sciences, it has undergone a cognitive turn emphasizing domain-general learning mechanisms.\nWe propose that a KLI-informed cognitive view on instructed L2 learning helps to systematically integrate the field into the learning sciences, encompassing not only domain-general learning mechanisms but also domain-general perspectives on knowledge and instruction. Importantly, this integration may generate novel, testable hypotheses in L2 research, grounded in an interdisciplinary understanding of knowledge, learning, and instruction.\nWe present a cognitive KLI-based perspective on instructed L2 learning and discuss challenges of this perspective, including the fundamentally integrative nature of language knowledge, the inherently expressive character of language (verbal, written, signed), and the limited relevance of understanding and sense-making processes in instructed L2 learning. Moreover, we provide an illustrative KLI-informed analysis of two empirical L2 studies. Based on these analyses, we discuss novel, testable hypotheses generated through the KLI lens that offer interdisciplinary approaches to known issues in L2 pedagogy, such as integrating multiple induction- and refinement-enhancing instructional principles to mitigate individual differences in L2 classrooms.",

The purpose of this study is to develop a CIT paradigm based on the attentional blink (AB) phenomenon and to verify its applicability using target detection accuracy as an index. AB refers to the failure to detect the second of two temporally proximate targets. The experimental results demonstrated that participants on the encoding group who had encoded crime-relevant items were more likely to miss the second target when the first target was crime-relevant than when it was irrelevant. In contrast, no such difference was observed for participants on the non-encoding group who had not encoded crime-related items. The result of the ROC analysis showed that the accuracy of discrimination based on AB magnitude was comparable to some of the autonomic indicators used in the current polygraph CIT. These findings provide empirical support for the feasibility of using an attentional blink-based CIT.",

          "abstract": "Rising mental health concerns among youth are widely reported with growing disparities in outcomes and access among racially and ethnically minoritized youth (Hoffman et al., 2022). Although evidence-based school- and community-based interventions show promise for reducing mental health concerns, implementing these approaches with fidelity remains difficult. Barriers to implementing school- and community-based mental health services include 1) limited acceptability to the youth and families served, 2) challenges accessing necessary training and materials for mental health professionals to implement services, and 3) regulatory and statutory barriers involved in providing mental health services (Damschroder et al., 2022). One solution, which is the focus of this manuscript, is to engage diverse community stakeholders (youth, families, mental health professionals, policymakers) in the co-design and co-implementation of a research agenda intended to redress mental health disparities through improved service delivery and coordination. The current paper describes an application of Liberatory Design to plan a research project focused on integrating school-based and after-school services intended to promote student mental health outcomes. Liberatory Design is an approach intended to engage diverse stakeholders, and address equity challenges through a flexible and iterative design process that centers human relationships and equity concerns. The current study presents stakeholder perspectives on the challenges and opportunities that surfaced through the design process. Implications for researchers considering Liberatory Design are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Human-AI collaboration becomes increasingly embedded in decision-making tasks, including systematic reviewing workflows such as title and abstract screening. Yet humans as final arbiters remain susceptible to influence from peripheral cues, leaving these hybrid workflows vulnerable to new forms of bias. This paper examined how two authority cues influence screening judgements: AI appraisals and journal prestige. Using preregistered experiments, we investigated how these cues shape inclusion decisions in a realistic abstract-screening task. We employed a 3 × 3 mixed design. Participants were randomly assigned to receive AI recommendations, AI disapprovals, or no AI input. Across trials, each participant evaluated abstracts that appeared with all three journal cues: prestigious labels, non-prestigious labels, and no journal information. Across Western graduate students, Asian bachelor’s-degree holders, and Western professionals (total N = 977), AI appraisals functioned as a strong and consistent authority cue, systematically biasing screening decisions. Journal prestige produced limited influence, emerging primarily when irrelevant abstracts were paired with prestigious journals, which increased incorrect inclusion. These findings demonstrate that AI-generated cues can introduce powerful new authority biases in human-AI collaborative screening. Implications for designing and governing (AI-aided) reviewing systems to ensure accurate, unbiased decision making are discussed.",

Emoji stimuli were presented in three horizontal positions in which participants (N = 121) made a valence evaluation. A 2 (emoji valence; positive, negative) x 3 (horizontal position; left, central, right) within-participants design was used to determine the impacts of emoji valence and position on accuracy and latency of valence evaluations. Responses were analysed in a 2x3 mixed effects binary regression with emoji valence and spatial congruency as fixed effects. No main or interaction effects of emoji valence and spatial congruence were observed. Our findings therefore add to the growing body of evidence which challenges the notion that we embody and process emoji in an equivalent way to other emotional stimuli.",

This study investigated the dynamic relationships between IB, depressive symptoms, and mood using both a daily diary design and longitudinal assessments. A non-clinical sample (N = 581) completed short daily measures of IB, depressive symptoms, and mood over 14 days. Standard assessments of IB and depressive symptoms completed at baseline were repeated at 2- and 4-week follow-up. Analysis of the daily data using Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models (RI-CLPM) indicated a robust trait-level association between IB and both depressive symptoms and mood, suggesting stable correlated individual differences. However, there was no evidence of predictive day-to-day associations. Regression analyses of the longitudinal data revealed that baseline IB significantly predicted depressive symptoms two and four weeks later. Overall, results replicate previous findings of both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between negative IB and depression symptoms, but suggest that day-to-day fluctuations in an individual’s negative IB are not associated with day-to-day fluctuations in their depression symptoms or mood. Future research should further explore how IB unfolds on even narrower time scales and could contribute to the onset and maintenance of depression over time.",

          "abstract": "Adaptive fact-learning systems optimize retention by tailoring review schedules to learner behaviour, yet most models consider only accuracy or the latency of correct responses, ignoring error timing. Decision-making research and dual-process theories suggest errors arise from distinct mechanisms: impulsiveness produces fast errors, whereas uncertainty yields slow errors, with corresponding differences in internal error monitoring. This implies error speed may differentially influence subsequent learning. In a spaced-repetition recognition task, we found differences in subsequent performance between fast and slow errors. Building on this, we investigated whether fast errors can be self-corrected by prompting participants to reconsider responses, using slow errors as a benchmark. Fast-latency errors were corrected significantly more often than slow-latency errors following prompting (44% vs. 24%). Accurate self-correction of fast errors improved subsequent item-level accuracy, whereas prompting slow-latency responses did not. These findings show fast and slow errors have distinct learning consequences and that latency-tailored feedback can enhance learning.",

          "abstract": "In den letzten zehn Jahren haben sich die rechtlichen und gesellschaftlichen Entwicklungen, die die LGBTIQ+ Community betreffen, weltweit sehr unterschiedlich gestaltet. Viele Regionen haben einvernehmliche gleichgeschlechtliche Handlungen entkriminalisiert, den Schutz für gleichgeschlechtliche Paare erweitert, eine rechtliche Anerkennung des Geschlechts auf Grundlage der Selbstidentifikation eingeführt und einige nicht einvernehmliche Operationen an intergeschlechtlichen Kindern verboten. Dennoch begann das Jahr 2025 mit bemerkenswerten Herausforderungen für die LGBTIQ+ Community. \nIn der Schweiz unterstützt weiterhin die Mehrheit der Bevölkerung LGBTIQ+ Personen, doch werden LGBTIQ+ Rechte gezielt politisch instrumentalisiert. Dies zeigt sich in Initiativen, die darauf abzielen, geschlechtergerechte Sprache einzuschränken und den Zugang zu geschlechtsbestätigender medizinischer Versorgung für trans Jugendliche zu begrenzen. Vor diesem Hintergrund führte das Swiss LGBTIQ+ Panel die sechste Umfragewelle durch, um die Lebensrealitäten von LGBTIQ+ Personen in der Schweiz zu erfassen.\nIn diesem Bericht präsentieren wir die zentralen Ergebnisse der Umfrage, darunter Erfahrungen mit dem Coming Out, das subjektive Sicherheitsempfinden und erlebte Diskriminierung (Teil 1 und 2) sowie die Teilnahme an LGBTIQ+ Räumen (Teil 3). Darüber hinaus berichten wir über Erfahrungen in Arbeitskontexten, Schulen, Lehrbetrieben und Universitäten sowie über die Situation von Personen, die arbeitslos sind, andere betreuen, pensioniert sind oder mit chronischen Krankheiten oder Beeinträchtigungen leben (Teil 4). Gesundheit und Gesundheitsverhalten werden in Teil 5 behandelt, während Teil 6 die Wahrnehmung der Situation von LGBTIQ+ Personen in der Schweiz und deren Hoffnungen für die Zukunft beleuchtet. Dank der Unterstützung des LGBTI Youth Fund enthält der Bericht zudem ein Kapitel mit besonderem Fokus auf LGBTIQ+ Jugendliche (&lt; 26 Jahren).\nWo relevant (z. B. bei Diskriminierungserfahrungen), werden getrennte Statistiken für Angehörige sexueller Minderheiten (z. B. schwule, lesbische, bisexuelle, pansexuelle oder asexuelle Personen), Angehörige geschlechtlicher Minderheiten (z. B. trans Personen) sowie intergeschlechtliche Personen dargestellt. Endogeschlechtliche cis-heterosexuelle unterstützende Personen wurden ebenfalls zur Teilnahme eingeladen. Die Umfrage war in Englisch, Deutsch, Französisch und Italienisch verfügbar. Dank der Unterstützung zahlreicher LGBTIQ+ Organisationen, Magazine und Einzelpersonen, die unsere Studie über verschiedene Kanäle geteilt haben, beantworteten 6’117 Personen unseren Online-Fragebogen zwischen Januar 2025 und August 2025.",

          "abstract": "Negli ultimi dieci anni, gli sviluppi legali e sociali che riguardano le comunità LGBTIQ+ hanno mostrato un’evoluzione eterogenea a livello globale. Molte regioni hanno depenalizzato i rapporti sessuali consensuali tra persone dello stesso sesso, ampliato le tutele per le coppie omosessuali, introdotto il riconoscimento legale del genere basato sull’autodeterminazione e vietato gli interventi chirurgici non consensuali su bambini intersex. Tuttavia, il 2025 è iniziato con sfide significative per le comunità LGBTIQ+. \nIn questo contesto, il Panel Svizzero LGBTIQ+ ha condotto la sesta ondata di sondaggi per comprendere le esperienze delle persone LGBTIQ+ che vivono in Svizzera.\nIn questo rapporto presentiamo i principali risultati dell’indagine, che trattano delle esperienze di coming out, della percezione della sicurezza e discriminazioni vissute (Sezioni 1 e 2), nonché della partecipazione a spazi LGBTIQ+ (Sezione 3). Riportiamo inoltre esperienze nei luoghi di lavoro, nelle scuole, negli apprendistati e nelle università, nonché le situazioni di persone disoccupate, familiari curanti, pensionate o con malattie o disabilità di lunga durata (Sezione 4). La Sezione 5 tratta della salute e dei comportamenti legati alla salute, mentre la Sezione 6 analizza la percezione della situazione delle persone LGBTIQ+ in Svizzera e le loro speranze per il futuro. Grazie al sostegno del LGBTI Youth Fund, è stata aggiunta una sezione speciale dedicata a* giovani LGBTIQ+ (under 26).\nLaddove pertinente (ad esempio, per le esperienze di discriminazione), forniamo statistiche separate per i membri delle minoranze sessuali (ad esempio, persone gay, lesbiche, bisessuali, pansessuali), delle minoranze di genere (ad esempio, persone trans) e per le persone intersex. Anche persone cisgender endosex eterosessuali (di seguito “endosex cis-eterosessuali”) sono stati invitate a partecipare. Il sondaggio era disponibile in inglese, tedesco, francese e italiano. Grazie al contributo di numerose organizzazioni LGBTIQ+, riviste e persone che hanno condiviso ampiamente il nostro studio attraverso diversi media, 6’117 persone hanno risposto al questionario tra gennaio e agosto 2025.",

De nombreuses régions ont dépénalisé les relations sexuelles consenties entre personnes de même sexe, élargi les protections accordées aux couples de même sexe, mis en place une reconnaissance légale du genre basée sur l’autodétermination et interdit les opérations chirurgicales non consenties sur les enfants intersexes. Toutefois, l’année 2025 a débuté avec des défis notables pour les communautés LGBTIQ+. \nDans ce rapport, nous présentons les principaux résultats de l’enquête, notamment les expériences de coming out, le sentiment de sécurité et les discriminations vécues (Sections 1 et 2), ainsi que la participation aux espaces LGBTIQ+ (Section 3). Nous rendons également compte des expériences vécues sur le lieu de travail, à l'école, en apprentissage et en enseignement supérieur, ainsi que de la situation des personnes sans emploi, qui donnent du care à d'autres personnes, à la retraite ou atteintes d'une maladie de longue durée ou d'un handicap (Section 4). La santé et les comportements en matière de santé sont présentés à la Section 5, et la Section 6 examine la façon dont les personnes perçoivent la situation des personnes LGBTIQ+ en Suisse et leurs espoirs pour l'avenir. Grâce au soutien du LGBTI Youth Fund, nous avons ajouté un chapitre avec un focus particulier sur les jeunes LGBTIQ+ (&lt;26 ans).\nLorsque cela est pertinent (par exemple, dans le cas de discrimination), nous fournissons des statistiques distinctes pour les membres de minorités sexuelles (par exemple, les personnes gaies, lesbiennes, bisexuelles, pansexuelles), les membres de minorités de genre (par exemple, les personnes trans) et les personnes intersexes. Les personnes alliées cisgenres endosexes hétérosexuelles (ci-après dénommées « endosexes cis-hétérosexuelles ») ont également été invitées à participer. L'enquête était disponible en anglais, allemand, français et italien. Grâce à l'aide de nombreuses organisations LGBTIQ+, de magazines et de personnes qui ont largement partagé notre étude via différents médias, 6’117 personnes ont répondu à notre questionnaire entre janvier 2025 et août 2025.",

          "abstract": "Political interest is fundamental to democratic engagement. Yet, its conceptualization remains debated. In this agenda-setting study, we offer a new but important perspective by conceptualizing political (dis)interest as a social identity. We introduce two innovative measures: the Positive Political Interest Identity Scale (PPIS) and the Negative Political Interest Identity Scale (NPIS). Employing Item Response Theory, we validate the construct validity of both scales in a preregistered study in the Netherlands (N = 1, 553). Using the same dataset, we demonstrate their predictive validity. The PPIS and NPIS uncover substantial differences in political attitudes and behaviors both between and within individuals who identify as politically (dis)interested. Conceptualizing political (dis)interest as a social identity enriches our understanding of the concept and its implications for politically relevant attitudes and behaviors, while also informing interventions to foster political interest equally across all citizens.",

          "authors": "Johanne Nedergaard; Mads Nielsen; Naja B. Trondhjem; Malu A. Hendriksen; Kasper Boye",
          "abstract": "Background: Few studies in aphasiology have investigated languages with a high degree of morphological complexity, and only one previous study has investigated aphasia in a polysynthetic language. Morphologically complex languages have great potential to inform theories of aphasia in general and agrammatic aphasia in particular. In the present study, we focus on one such language, namely Kalaallisut (West Greenlandic), which has unusually rich inflectional and derivational morphology.\nAims: The present study aimed to describe the semispontaneous speech of speakers of Kalaallisut with non-fluent aphasia with a specific focus on morphosyntactic characteristics. Based on previous studies, we hypothesised that their aphasic speech would consist of relatively slow and short utterances, that morphological features would be less affected than syntactic features, and that verbs would be particularly affected. In case of grammatical errors, we did not expect them to consist in omission of inflectional endings but rather erroneous substitution of other forms.\nMethods &amp; Procedures: We elicited semispontaneous speech from 11 Kalaallisut speakers with non-fluent aphasia and 6 speakers without aphasia using pictures and questions about personal experiences. The speech samples underwent extensive morphosyntactic analyses.\nOutcomes &amp; Results: Participants with aphasia produced utterances that were slower, shorter, and contained fewer subordinate verbs than those produced by control participants. They also produced shorter words, although this difference was less marked. The derivational morphology appeared relatively spared while the inflectional forms on verbs displayed reduced diversity. Participants with aphasia did not systematically produce morphological errors.\nConclusions: Non-fluent aphasia in Kalaallisut is characterised by slow, short and syntactically simple utterances, which is similar to the characteristics of non-fluent aphasia in other languages. However, the morphology produced by individuals with non-fluent aphasia appears relatively spared which goes against the view that impaired functional morphology characterises non-fluent aphasia. Our findings are best explained by crosslinguistically-informed morphosyntactic account grounded in cognitive mechanisms.",

          "authors": "Benoît de Courson; Willem Frankenhuis; Daniel Nettle",
          "abstract": "The impacts of poverty and material scarcity on human decision making appear paradoxical. One set of findings associates poverty with risk aversion, whilst another set associates it with risk taking. We present an idealized general model, the ‘desperation threshold model’ (DTM), that explains how both these accounts can be correct. The DTM assumes a utility function with two features: a threshold or ‘cliff’, a point where utility declines steeply with a small loss of resources because basic needs can no longer be met; and a ‘rock bottom’, a point where utility is not made any worse by further loss of resources because basic needs are not being met anyway. Just above the threshold, people’s main concern is not falling below, and they are predicted to avoid risk. Below the threshold, they have little left to lose, their most important concern is jumping above, and they are predicted to take risks that would otherwise be avoided. Versions of the DTM have been proposed under various names across biology, anthropology, economics and psychology. We review a broad range of relevant empirical evidence from a variety of societal contexts. Though the model primarily concerns individual decision making, it connects to a range of population-scale and societal issues such as: the consequences of economic inequality; the deterrence of crime; and the optimal design and behavioural consequences of the welfare state. We discuss a number of interpretative issues and offer an agenda for future DTM research that bridges disciplines.",

          "authors": "Maria Jalynskij; Franz-Josef Neyer; Clemens M. Lechner",
          "abstract": "The maturity principle posits that socially desirable personality traits, such as agreeableness, conscientiousness and emotional stability tend to increase across adulthood. This study examined whether this principle extends to social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills by investigating age differences in a representative sample of N = 940 German adults (age range: 18-65, mean age = 43, SD = 14, 50 % female) using moderated non-linear factor analysis models and comparing them to age differences in Big Five traits in a demographically comparable sample. Additionally, we explored age-specific associations between SEB skills and life quality, measured by life satisfaction and self-rated health. Contrary to the widely accepted maturity principle, we found few corresponding age differences in SEB skills, whereas the expected age-related patterns were evident in Big Five traits. These results remained consistent regardless of the level of measurement invariance. Some skills showed lower mean levels in older adults, and skill variances differed with age. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the maturity principle known from the Big Five literature does not fully generalize to SEB skills. This cross-sectional study lays the groundwork for future longitudinal research on SEB skills and highlights the importance of considering individuals within context.\nKeywords: age differences, life satisfaction, maturity principle, SEB skills, self-rated health",

          "abstract": "Emerging from the accelerating pace of AI development, user fatigue arising from prolonged human–AI interaction has become an increasing concern in public discourse. This growing attention underscores the need to clarify why sustained engagement with AI systems can generate psychophysiological strain and how such exhaustion manifests in users. The present research develops a conceptual framework for AI fatigue and introduces the 15-item AI Fatigue Scale as a validated tool for examining its correlates. Across four studies with 720 participants, we generated and content-validated an item pool, identified and confirmed a four-factor (cognitive, emotional, physical, behavioural) higher-order model. The scale demonstrated strong internal consistency (α = .92), robust factor loadings, two-week test–retest reliability (ICC(2,1) = .65), and measurement invariance across sex. Convergent validity was supported through associations with general, clinical, and digital fatigue, and with AI-specific technostress, while discriminant validity was demonstrated against adjacent constructs including AI dependency, AI attachment, and critical thinking in AI use. Within the nomological network, greater AI fatigue was associated with more negative affect, more negative attitudes toward AI, higher neuroticism, and lower conscientiousness and extraversion. Greater AI fatigue predicted lower current AI use and stronger intentions to reduce use in the next three months, above and beyond general, clinical, and digital fatigue as well as AI-specific technostress. These findings provide a validated tool for examining AI fatigue and its underlying mechanisms, and establish an initial empirical foundation for how the phenomenon develops, manifests, and shapes users’ engagement with AI systems.",

However, the nature of this experience, and the neural mechanisms underlying it, have proved difficult to study scientifically. Many previous studies instructed participants to make simple manual actions, and then report their preceding intention only retrospectively. We combined an action fluency paradigm with pseudorandom probes of conscious experience to address these issues, and used EEG to explore neural correlates of prospective intention. In two experiments involving 51 participants, we found conscious intention emerged over 1 s before estimated action onset. Further, we found a readiness-potential-like activity that was stronger prior to those probes that participants reported as interrupting a conscious intention, compared to other probes. In addition, probes that interrupted conscious intention were found to occur after lateralization of the readiness-potential-like activity to the hemisphere contralateral to the intended to type the first letter. Our results provide novel evidence for a prospective experience of conscious intention associated with neural processes that generate voluntary actions.",

          "abstract": "Mental simulation effects, observed through sentence-picture verification tasks, reveal that understanding language can reactivate perceptual experiences. This study investigates whether Chinese sortal classifiers modulate mental simulation during sentence comprehension. Two competing linguistic accounts offer different predictions: the profiling account suggests that classifiers highlight existing noun features, while the coercion account proposes that classifiers assign contextual meanings to nouns. Using a sentence-picture verification paradigm with 250 native Chinese speakers, we conducted two experiments. Study 1 (Amplification Test) found that appropriate classifiers produced significant mental simulation effects, but only when stimuli were limited to artifacts and animals. Study 2 (Coercion Test) yielded null findings across all classifier types, providing no support for the coercion account and weak support for the profiling account. These findings provide preliminary evidence that specific classifiers can enhance mental simulation under certain conditions, but leave unresolved key questions about the underlying mechanisms. We discuss methodological factors that may have constrained the detection of classifier effects and propose research directions for understanding how classifiers modulate mental simulation.",

          "authors": "Yeray Barrios-Fleitas; Eduardo Lalla-Ruiz; Arend Rensink",
          "abstract": "Deciding how to assign students to teams for effective teamwork, also known as the Team Formation Problem (TFP) in education, remains insufficiently understood despite decades of research across different disciplines offering fragmented guidance. In higher education, instructors must form short-lived teams using limited data while balancing pedagogical goals and logistical constraints, conditions that differ sharply from professional team settings. To address this fragmentation, this study develops an integrated taxonomy of educational TFP grounded in a systematic review of 35 peer-reviewed studies. Building upon perspectives from Operations Research, Organizational Psychology, and Educational Research, the taxonomy organizes TFP variants into three interrelated pillars: (1) Input attributes, which specify the student attributes used to form teams; (2) Problem formulation, which describes how attributes are manipulated and formalizes pedagogical objectives and constraints into optimization model; and (3) Solution methods, which describe the algorithms used to generate feasible team assignments. This structure clarifies the modeling decisions that underpin different TFP variants and provides a common vocabulary for describing them, enabling transparent reporting and meaningful comparison between studies that previously lacked a shared frame of reference. This structure makes explicit how pedagogical rationales, such as fairness, peer learning, or cohesion, translate into concrete modeling decisions, enabling transparent reporting and like-for-like comparison across studies that were previously not comparable. The review reveals substantial heterogeneity in how TFP variants are defined and reported, and shows that the proposed taxonomy can classify all identified formulations while exposing cross-disciplinary inconsistencies and gaps. The paper concludes with methodological guidelines that standardize how TFP variants should be specified and reported, supporting transparent communication, comparative analysis, and future benchmarking of team formation methods in educational contexts.",

          "abstract": "Background: Israel’s genocide in the Gaza Strip has killed 7.9% of the population, and thousands of Palestinians have faced myriad forms of violence and imminent threats to life, including physical injuries from ballistics, home demolitions, and torture. These highly traumatic conditions pose severe psychological threats to Palestinians and may have reverberating effects in neighboring Arab countries. This scoping review aimed to examine the direct and indirect mental health consequences of Israel’s genocidal assault on Gazans, Palestinian citizens outside of Gaza, and populations in neighboring Arab countries and also investigated processes of coping and resilience among Palestinians. \nMethods: Following (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines, 42 articles, which were published after October 2023, were identified from five major search engines, including PubMed, Scopus, SpringerLink, Proquest, and Google Scholar. Studies investigated the psychological impacts of the 2023 genocide in Gaza, and their results were categorized into three groups: psychological impacts of wars, resilience, and coping strategies studies under war circumstances. \nResults: Findings revealed devastating mental health effects due to the genocide, with Gazans experiencing the most extreme outcomes. Gazan samples reported alarmingly high prevalence rates of mental health symptoms, including depression (72.7-99.5%), anxiety (65.0-99.7%), and PTSD (63.4-83.5%), which were the highest among all examined groups. Resilience and coping resources among Palestinians included cognitive strategies, family and social support, and religion. \nConclusion: These findings highlight the large-scale psychological consequences of the 2023 Gazan genocide and underscores the urgent need for emergency mental health interventions in Palestine. Immediate action is necessary to prevent further psychological damage from the genocide and avert an irreversible humanitarian catastrophe.",

          "abstract": "In polarized societies, basic questions about what constitutes prejudice can become deeply contested. After Hamas’s October 7 attack and Israel’s subsequent invasion of Gaza, discourse about the conflict has been marked by disputes over antisemitism. We investigate what are and what shapes American beliefs about antisemitism. Analysis of over one million Google restaurant reviews shows that ratings of Israeli restaurants declined as Israel’s ground war intensified. We then use this finding to interrogate American perceptions of antisemitism. A nationally representative survey experiment (N = 3, 200) finds that perceptions of whether such behavior is antisemitic are deeply polarized along partisan lines—but largely unaffected by media framing of the conflict. A follow-up survey (N = 3, 000) conducted unexpectedly during Israel’s strike on Iran, shows that Americans surveyed after the attack were less likely to interpret controversial behavior and speech as antisemitic. Our findings reveal the polarized and contingent nature of antisemitic beliefs.",

          "abstract": "The tendency of individuals to connect with similar others (i.e., homophily) is a cornerstone of social networks. Individuals are characterized by multiple attributes interacting in complex ways, challenging the unidimensional view on homophilic relationship formation. We introduce a multidimensional social distance attachment model integrating both exclusive (e.g., gender) and non-exclusive (e.g., language) features to capture homo- and hetero-philic behaviors. By embedding attributes as vectors within a metric space, we estimate the relative contribution of each attribute to the overall network features, and evaluate how their correlations shape inclusion dynamics. We test our model on two empirical networks of cultural production: the correspondence of the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation (IIIC) and contemporary global music collaborations. In both cases, heterophily enhances the centrality of minorities, albeit the enhancement depends on the attributes' internal composition and interdependence. Our findings demonstrate that inclusion policies must account for the multidimensional nature of social identities, and can open alternative and non-trivial pathways toward more equitable visibility in social systems.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: To enhance the understanding of different survey questions and the opportunities they provide to measure fear of crime as a latent trait, examining both crime-type and consequence items.\nMethods: Items from five surveys used in the Stockholm Region were coded into content areas. Cognitive interviews (n = 19) were analysed for response processes. Rasch analyses were conducted on the Swedish Crime Survey (n = 4,264) and the City of Stockholm Crime Survey (n = 7,333).\nResults: The surveys covered overlapping topics but used distinct phrasings. Response comprehension was generally adequate, yet some terms were interpreted differently. Respondents found it difficult to isolate fear of crime from other motives in the consequence items. There was no clear advantage to either frequency- or consequence-framed items, whereas intensity stems imposed a lower response burden. Psychometrically, unidimensional solutions were hard to achieve for either crime type or consequence item sets. The evidence suggests heterogeneity across population groups.\nConclusions: Current practice involves both strengths and weaknesses. This study suggests paths toward enhanced measurement of the fear of crime. Measuring fear of crime as a single, invariant latent trait is far from straightforward. The heterogeneity of responses across population groups indicates that different groups evaluate their fear of crime types and consequences differently, challenging the assumption of unidimensionality. However, the cognitive interviews suggest ways to clarify item wording and reduce respondent burden.",

We analyse 3,300,695 days of actual household electricity use in Queensland, Australia, available in 5-minute intervals to identify five distinctly different household electricity consumption patterns. We then assign 366,439,750 days of electricity use of 1,097,125 households in Queensland, Australia, to those prototypical patterns to identify household market segments with distinct electricity use patterns and household characteristics. Segment profiles show that the benefits of rooftop photovoltaics are currently asymmetrically accessible to the Australian population in Queensland. Households with photovoltaic systems typically live in their own house, report a high education and income level, whereas households without photovoltaics who have the most consistent electricity use pattern across the day and use most electricity from the grid are more likely to rent, live in an apartment and report lower income and education levels. Regulatory modifications can make cost cost-saving benefits of rooftop solar systems available to a much wider section of the Australian community in Queensland, while also contributing to carbon emissions reduction via an increase in renewable energy.",

          "abstract": "The era of AI has begun. Generative AI is rapidly reshaping knowledge production, culture, and political authority, giving rise to an emerging AI society. Yet this transformation did not emerge ex nihilo. This paper argues that the AI society can only be understood in relation to the platform society from which it arises. Tracing the transition from platforms to AI, we identify interlinked economic, epistemic, and political shifts. Economically, AI emerges within platform-based rentier capitalism but reconfigures the monopoly mechanisms on which its accumulation depends. Epistemically, LLMs mark a shift from predictive to generative epistemics, entangling theory formation and knowledge production with private research-as-a-service infrastructures. Politically, governance shifts from data politics to alignment politics: from shaping visibility to shaping what can be said, thought, and imagined. Together, these transformations signal a qualitative shift in mediation—from governing interaction to governing cognition itself—and call for a Critical AI Studies.",

          "abstract": "Importance: Cities in North America are beginning to wield vacancy taxes (a\nproperty tax imposed on unoccupied homes) as a tool to reduce rapidly growing home\nprices. However, these taxes are being implemented with little to no empirical evidence\nbacking their effectiveness.\nObjective: To determine whether Washington, D.C.’s 2003-imposed vacancy tax\nimpacted home prices.\n\nDesign: A panel data set for the years 1978-2013 was compiled for this analy-\nsis. Data was collected on 13 different variables related to the housing market for\n31 metropolitan statistical areas, including Washington, D.C. The synthetic control\nmethod was applied to create a counterfactual Washington, D.C. using the available\nvariables and donor cities. House price comparisons were then made over time to deter-\nmine what Washington, D.C.’s average house prices would have been absent their 2003\nvacancy tax, as measured by the synthetic control unit. Robustness checks, placebo\ntests, and time series analyses were subsequently used to validate and investigate the\nprimary results.\n\nResults: Contrary to expectations, there is a gap following the 2003 treatment that\nsuggests Washington, D.C.’s tax may have increased house prices rather than decreased\nor limited them. An interrupted time series analysis also shows a statistically significant\nbreak in the house price trajectory starting in approximately 2005. However, a placebo\nin space test casts doubt on any significant results as Washington, D.C.’s outcomes are\nunremarkable when applying the potential treatment to other U.S. cities.\n\nConclusions and Relevance: There is no evidence that the 2003 tax reduced\nhouse prices. Local governments in North America should be cautious about imple-\nmenting vacancy taxes if the primary or sole purpose is to reduce or restrict house\nprices.",

By shifting our analytical lens from actors to public cultural ideas and object, our theory can explain change in cultural forms over large and long frames of analysis using formal evolutionary mechanisms. Complementing this theory, the paper introduces a suite of novel methods to explain change in the historical trajectories of populations of cultural ideas/objects (e.g., music groups, hashtags, laws, technologies, and organizations) through diversification rates. We deploy our theory and methods to study the history of Metal Music over more than three decades, using a complete dataset of all bands active between 1968 and 2000. Over the course of its history, we find strong evidence that the genre has been fundamentally shaped by competition between ideas for the cognitive resources actors can invest in learning about and reproducing this cultural form over time.

The estimates were computed directly from the unit-record microdata for 196 household surveys, using a suite of machine-learning tools selected to minimize the omitted variable and overfitting biases discussed in the literature. Overall, differences in opportunities account for substantial shares of total income inequality (with the mean of our preferred estimate being 40.9%), but there is substantial variation across countries, with estimates ranging from 18.9% in Denmark (2011) to 76.7% in South Africa (2017). The latest US estimate of 41.6% places it among the most opportunity unequal high-income countries. We also find strong support for the existence of a positive association between income inequality and relative inequality of opportunity, analogous to the “Great Gatsby Curve” for mobility and inequality. Similarly, there is evidence of an inverted-U “Opportunity Kuznets curve.” The database is available at www.geom.ecineq.org. (Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality Working Paper)",

To gain a deeper understanding of their lived experiences, we conducted interviews and surveys with 22 women physicians from across the United States and Canada. We analyzed 309 narrative excerpts using a mixed-methods thematic analysis. Seven key themes emerged: early influences and role models, family and life-course pressures, gendered dynamics in daily practice, structural inequities, wellness and burnout, leadership and mentorship, and visions for the future of medicine. Participants described how career demands often conflicted with family responsibilities, how bias and misidentification shaped legitimacy, and how systemic burdens intensified burnout. Yet they also emphasized the strength of resilience, mentorship, and optimism regarding technology, as well as collective advocacy. These narratives suggest that achieving gender equity in medicine is essential not only to ensure justice among clinicians but also to sustain compassionate, high-quality patient care.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how women and men retrospectively self-assess the extent to which different factors have contributed to their current wealth. Studying gender differences in these self-assessments is crucial because they reflect the opportunity structures individuals have experienced and shape how wealth accumulation and inequalities are interpreted, legitimized, and potentially acted upon. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP; waves 2017 and 2019, N=18,574), we first analyse gender differences in retrospective assessments of how eight different factors have contributed to individuals’ current wealth and, second, how these gendered assessments vary across the wealth and age distribution. Our results show that men tend to assess higher contributions of dependent employment, self-employment/entrepreneurship, and financial business to their current wealth than women, who assess higher contributions of marriage and inheritance than men. These gender differences are particularly pronounced at the upper end of the wealth distribution and become more marked at older ages. Overall, women tend to emphasize relational and dependent contributors to their current wealth, while men emphasize self-generated and market-based pathways. Assessments of wealth contributors thus mirror persistent economic gender disparities, illustrating how the gender wealth gap may be legitimized and reproduced.",

          "abstract": "Background\nCo-production with public stakeholders is increasingly recognised as an important approach to ensuring health research is relevant to communities and interventions and likely to generate sustainable change. Ideally, co-production needs to be sustained throughout different stages of research and allow stakeholders ownership of the research agenda. We explore a case study of iterative co-production conducted over a nine-month period with a wide range of disparate stakeholders that transformed into a research-ready consortium able to design and obtain funding for a creative health research programme. \n\nMain body\nThe ReCITE consortium is comprised of academics, creatives, and specialists in capacity development and community engagement in Liverpool, UK. Its main focus is health equity and coming up with new ways of working to tackle entrenched, avoidable and unfair differences in health. ReCITE led a series of six workshops in 2023 to co-produce a research programme to investigate creative approaches for improving health equity. Fifty-six stakeholders from the academic, creative and arts, health, community and voluntary sectors participated across six workshops that sought broad engagement and consolidated stakeholder input to develop a research agenda and expand the consortium. Common emerging themes were: 1) understanding complexities in funding creative health; 2) investigating storytelling as a catalyst for change; 3) achieving change through collective action; 4) the role of creative advocacy to change societal and funding structures; 5) evidencing the impact of community-led creative health interventions on health equity. These formed multiple co-produced outputs, including five pillars of a theory of change for the research that underpinned the research questions and determined five interventions to take forward by the research-ready consortium to securing funding for future work. \n\nConclusion\t\nThe iterative process of gaining stakeholder input, consolidating it, and seeking further input, helped to incorporate the perspectives of different stakeholder groups into different project outputs. Equitable power-sharing guided decision-making over what to prioritise was important in building ownership of the research agenda and trust among stakeholders. However, this was a lengthy iterative process and sustaining time commitment was difficult for those stakeholders who were not fully funded to participate.",

          "abstract": "Straightlining, (nearly) identical responses in multi-item batteries, is among the most widely used indicators of satisficing. However, straightlining does not necessarily reflect low-quality responses; it can also result from genuine similar attitudes or behaviors. We differentiate between plausible straightlining batteries, where uniform responses are reasonable given specific question characteristics and content, and implausible straightlining batteries, where uniform responding is not expected and most likely signals satisficing. Using data from the GESIS Panel.pop, a mixed-mode probability-based panel in Germany, we leverage a layout change that transitioned multi-item batteries from matrix to single-item formats to study plausible and implausible straightlining. Our findings, based on mixed-effects logistic regression models, indicate that respondents are significantly more likely to straightline on plausible than on implausible batteries. While question format does not affect straightlining overall, single-item formats are associated with less straightlining on implausible batteries but more on plausible batteries. Additional analyses show that web respondents are less likely to straightline than mail respondents, and this mode effect is more pronounced in single-item formats. Smartphone respondents are more likely to straightline than desktop or tablet respondents, particularly on implausible straightlining batteries. These results highlight the importance of considering question characteristics and content when using straightlining as an indicator of satisficing to avoid flagging genuine responses as low-quality data.",

          "abstract": "It was often argued that smartphones facilitate access to a large number of resources whenever and wherever needed. In stressful instances, smartphone-enabled easy access could be particularly relevant as they could reduce the effort needed to access resources and thereby increase efficient coping with stressful instances. However, while this is often argued for it has not been tested. This research report builds on a secondary analysis of two experience sampling studies on the use of phones for coping with stress in two samples of mothers (NStudy1 = 50;  NStudy2 = 225). Both studies asked mothers to report on stressful situations that had happened in the last two hours several times a day. We tested whether phone use in a stressful situation was related to less perceived coping effort and whether decreased coping effort related to more perceived coping efficacy. We find no support for the relation between effort and coping efficacy and mixed support for the relation of phone use and effort. Especially the inconclusive relationship between effort and smartphone use is surprising and challenges often used arguments in the mobile communication literature.  Exploratory analyses suggest that the relationship between coping effort and phone use might be different depending on which coping strategy is applied.",

Understanding whether governments’ pledges of resolve are backed by their citizens is crucial for the credibility of these commitments. Here we show, based on survey experiments with 10,011 respondents in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Italy, that these countries’ publics share a similar pattern of preferences. In all countries, citizens strongly endorse Ukraine’s sovereignty and self-determination while weighing human suffering and conflict escalation risk, but less so economic costs. However, within countries, attitudes are polarized: roughly one quarter of citizens with pro-Western orientations show firm resolve, whereas another quarter with anti-Western views remain largely indifferent to political outcomes for Ukraine. These divisions indicate that democratic party competition could constrain the unity and durability of Western resolve against autocratic aggression.",

Drawing on nine waves of German panel data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey in Four European Countries (2011–2022), I demonstrate that the “Germanness” of parental networks shapes youth respondents’ majority- group ties in adolescence, and illustrate how these social inheritances influence the Germanness of adolescent networks during the transition to early adulthood. By Wave 9, when most respondents are in their late 20s, the Germanness of social networks is closely linked to political preferences: native majorities with more German-centric networks are less likely to support left-wing parties, while the inverse is true for most of their immigrant-origin peers. These patterns reflect distinct but complementary mechanisms: for immigrants and their descendants, majority ties signal structural assimilation into “mainstream” political culture and convergence with liberal-cosmopolitan norms; for natives, ethnically diverse social networks reinforce enculturation into progressive political communities. Overall, these findings show that political socialisation operates not only through the transmission of beliefs and cultural orientations, but through the concomitant reproduction of social environments.",

          "abstract": "Gender revolution theory posits that, in contexts with high female labor participation, couples sharing domestic work equally will (desire to) have more children. However, empirical findings at the micro level have been mixed. We propose three reasons why prior research has been inconclusive: (1) a tendency to treat gender attitudes or practices as a single continuum, rather than multidimensionally; (2) insufficient attention to partner’s shared attitudes; and (3) empirical approaches that conflate timing and quantum. We propose a refined approach that considers how shared gender egalitarian attitudes toward work divisions, female careers, and child-welfare are differentially related to the quantum versus timing of fertility. Using cure models and data from Germany, we show that couples’ shared gender egalitarian attitudes regarding domestic work, career support, and child welfare have distinct relationships with the occurrence and timing of first births. We find no evidence of higher probability of first births among couples who shared egalitarian attitudes regarding domestic work, career support, child welfare, or all three domains. However, egalitarian couples regarding domestic work and career support have later first births. Our results underscore the importance of (1) differentiated measurements of gender attitudes, and (2) considering quantum and timing as affected separately.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the link between economic performance and multidimensional well-being in the Italian context using a combination of the ISTAT BES approach (Benessere Equo e Sostenibile) and machine learning and clustering analysis. On the basis of a dataset of 19 Italian regions and the Autonomous Provinces of Trento and Bolzano from 2012 to 2023, it will be examined how the three BES components—Benessere (B), Equità (E), and Sostenibilità (S)—are intertwined with the Gross Domestic Product of the regions. Regarding the Benessere (B) component of well-being, the Gross Domestic Product will be analyzed using a regression approach of the K-Nearest Neighbors type to reveal the complex linkages between health outcomes, education outcomes, working conditions, social participation, and economic performance. The clustering of the B indicators and the Gross Domestic Product will be done using Hierarchical Clustering analysis to identify homogeneous territories characterized by different levels of quality of life and economic prosperity. Regarding the Equità (E) component of well-being, the regression analysis will be done using the Boosting algorithm to model the linkages between the Gross Domestic Product and the indicators of income distribution, poverty, material deprivation, and inclusion in the labor market. Boosting regression analysis will be particularly useful for this purpose since it models the complex interactions and thresholds of social and economic inequalities. Hierarchical Clustering analysis will be applied to identify the territories characterized by different levels of equity and economic growth. Regarding the Sostenibilità (S) component of well-being, the Gross Domestic Product will be modeled using Boosting regression analysis to reveal the very complex linkages between the economic performance of the territories and the indicators of environmental quality, risk of climate change, innovation outcomes, and the quality of public services. For this purpose, the analysis will use the Random Forest algorithm to identify the territories characterized by different levels of sustainability and economic performance. The analysis will show that the BES approach provides a very useful framework to identify the very different levels of linkages between the economic performance of the territories and the outcomes of the BES approach. The analysis will provide evidence that the BES approach is a very useful framework for the analysis of the linkages between the economic performance of the territories and the outcomes of the BES approach.",

          "authors": "Yoav Roll",
          "abstract": "Over the past three decades, right-wing populism has steadily risen to prominence across the world. Yet a crucial socio-economic context for its development - the household and its underlying gender dynamics - remains under-explored in research on right-wing populism. This study investigates how the income, level of education, and class within cohabiting couples in the Netherlands, shape their support for right-wing populism through three diverse predictors, ranging from behavioural to attitudinal: voting for right-wing populist [RWP] parties, aim to vote for RWP parties, and sympathy towards RWP parties. Four models are tested to explain these relationships: male dominance, sharing, individual, and economic dominance models. Based on previous studies focusing on non-RWP parties, I expected the individual model for men and the sharing model for women to provide the best fit. Using data from the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences, this paper utilises diagonal reference models [DRM], for men and women separately, to trace the relative influence of the respondent and their partner on their RWP support. As far as I know, DRM has never been used to predict support for RWP parties. As expected, gender differences are evident. However, the data show, contrary to expectation, that the sharing model provides the best fit for men, while the individual model provides the best fit for women when it comes to income and education. Regarding class, as expected, the sharing model provides the best fit for women. The implications of these findings are discussed in light of the diverse characteristics of the economic standing predictors and the different facets of RWP support tested. As women increasingly join the workforce and occupy diverse roles, the ways in which men and women perceive their economic circumstances - particularly within households - diverge significantly. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for household context and gender dynamics in understanding the rise of right-wing populism in developed democracies such as the Netherlands.",

This article takes a different perspective, applying ideas from an ecological approach to culture to social media informational dynamics. It argues that success online depends both on the intrinsic appeal of content to receivers and on how well content serves producers’ strategic goals within the constraints and affordances of specific platforms. These goals include reputation management, coalition building and identity management, and coordination or participation in shared activities. Transmission is often a by-product of these motivations, and replication fidelity plays a limited role compared with transformations that adapt content to local incentives. Finally, the article suggests that platforms and communities can be understood as distinct ecological niches, each characterised by different audience structures, affordances, metrics, and algorithmic pressures. This perspective offers novel insight to persistent debates on social media dynamics, such as misinformation, radicalisation and polarisation, and the reasons behind online success.",

Headline estimates of the aggregate value of this extraction have been widely taken to substantiate two politico-normative issues: that the South is systematically exploited through international price formation, and that this drain constitutes a binding constraint on Southern development and a precondition for Northern prosperity. This paper argues that neither claim is supported by the new measurement agenda. It shows that new drain estimates rely on untenable premises -- in particular, claims of North-South parity in productivity and export composition. Stipped of these assumptions, Hickel et al's method can't yield a counterfactual ``fair price\" vector, meaning that their estimates are ungrounded and indeterminate. Moreover, even granting the estimates, they do not sustain an underdevelopment thesis. In standard growth regressions and long-run club-convergence tests, higher measured drain is non-negative and often positively associated with Southern growth once conventional fundamentals are controlled for. The paper suggests ways that research in ecological economics can be placed on a firmer conceptual footing.",

          "abstract": "This article undertakes a focused, thematic synthesis of interdisciplinary scientific literature to synthesize existing knowledge on how Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is legitimized and normalized across diverse sociocultural contexts. Our analysis comprehensively covers physical, psychological, sexual, and controlling behaviours. The effect of this review is a novel hierarchical typology of narratives that frame and justify abuse, which are then analysed through the lens of Bandura’s eight mechanisms of moral disengagement (MD). The core argument proposes that the widespread persistence of IPV is sustained by a system of social coherence, not solely individual pathology. Legitimization operates hierarchically: fundamental societal ideologies provide the foundational Moral Justification, enabling the subsequent activation of individual MD strategies (specifically Dehumanization, Attribution of Blame, and Diffusion of Responsibility) by perpetrators. Crucially, the MD framework is extended to show that these narratives are also mobilized by external observers and social institutions to manage moral discomfort and maintain a predictable social order through defensive attribution and the Belief in a Just World. This model demonstrates that effective prevention must target the underlying cultural narratives and the hierarchical moral architecture that actively license these moral exemptions.",

          "authors": "Ruslan Guseinov",
          "abstract": "Why do some autocracies experience violent anti-regime mobilization while others remain quiescent? The literature does not provide sufficient theoretical arguments and empirical evidence linking fiscal strength in autocracies to mass mobilization. In my paper, I suggest that fiscal capacity shapes authoritarian stability: autocracies with greater fiscal room can finance public goods, the military and security apparatus at high levels, solving the fundamental problem of authoritarian control and power-sharing. Moreover, higher fiscal capacity increases protest costs for citizens, which constitutes a \"silence-buying\" effect, a new term I coin in the context of authoritarian civil resistance. My argument stems from some comparative politics theories and theoretical statements of Jack Goldstone and Theda Skocpol. Using panel data on violent mass anti-regime mobilization from 2003 to 2022 and introducing a novel operationalization of fiscal capacity as central government debt, I employ logistic models for protest onset and negative binomial models for protest counts to estimate the effect of the central government debt on violent contention. Across specifications, robustness checks and zero-inflation corrections, the effect stays significantly positive, suggesting that fiscal constraints pose a destabilizing threat to autocracies. Findings show that fiscal capacity has been overlooked as a viable factor of contention and provide sufficient evidence in favor of a new operationalization of fiscal capacity.",

          "authors": "J. Vázquez",
          "abstract": "The exchange of favors is one of the most common manifestations of social altruism and a common dynamic in human relationships. It involves a transfer of value that is not usually made explicit, which can lead to discrepant perceptual valuations between the giver and the receiver of the favor. Attempts to formally analyze these dynamics are hindered by the subjective and unexpressed nature of the value and debt expectations that arise, as well as by their not always monetary nature. This article introduces the theoretical proposal of a new conceptual analytical framework, the Subjective Valuation Matrix (SVM), based on a geometric-spatial representation designed to make these dynamics visible.\nThe SVM builds the valuation of a favor on two fundamental dimensions: the sacrifice it entails for the giver and the benefit it provides to the receiver. On this basis, the model incorporates the formalization of known perceptual biases, being able to show a representation of the distorted subjective evaluative space of each actor. By overlaying both representations—giver and receiver—the perceptual distance between them becomes visible, and the areas of the evaluative space where latent conflict is most likely can be identified.\nThe SVM offers a tool to visualize the effect of these perceptual biases and provides an analytical method with quantifying potential that allows the identification of the precursory causes of conflict in the context of favor exchange, but with capability to extend to any other dynamic of non-explicit value exchange.",

Recent developments have begun to quantify change over time and initial differences, but it is unclear how to use these components to understand the relative importance of change, especially when change is modeled non-linearly. To advance this debate, we introduce a measure for quantifying the proportion of systematic variance in panel data attributable to intrapersonal change. Applying this measure to 610 items from seven surveys in five countries, we find that although intrapersonal change is common, it does not explain a large share of systematic variance.",

          "abstract": "In November 2025, a federal judge in the Eastern District of Virginia unsealed a spreadsheet containing the locations of 614 automatic license plate reader (ALPR) cameras currently in use in Hampton Roads, Virginia. ALPR cameras are an emergent form of networked surveillance infrastructure that capture images of every vehicle that passes by, generate a “vehicle fingerprint,” and store those data in databases searchable by law enforcement, typically without warrants or court orders for access.  The release of these locational data provides a rare opportunity to examine the opaque geography of contemporary surveillance and to assess whether ALPR camera deployment reproduces the same racialized and classed patterns long associated with policing and state surveillance in the United States. In this article, we use geographic information systems (GIS) and descriptive statistical analysis to map the distribution of 614 Flock Safety ALPR cameras in relation to racial and poverty profiles of the neighborhoods where the cameras are located. Our findings show that ALPR camera deployment is deeply and systematically racialized and economically stratified, with predominantly Black and high-poverty neighborhoods bearing a disproportionate share of ALPR surveillance infrastructure across Hampton Roads. We argue that these patterns do not reflect isolated siting decisions, but rather are the result of broader structural dynamics, including the privatization of surveillance infrastructure, weak democratic oversight, and the normalization of seemingly objective, tech-washed policing. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for public policy, civil liberties, democratic accountability, and Fourth Amendment protections.",

          "abstract": "As renewables become the dominant source of electricity, insufficient adaptations of overall\nsystem designs to the demands of renewables produce costs and uncertainties. Sustainability\ntransitions research has failed so far to foreground these issues due to its focus on early\ntransition challenges and a theoretical emphasis on market diffusion, technology support, and\nmechanisms of weak coordination. In this paper, we argue that challenges and thus potential\nsolutions in advanced transition phases differ fundamentally from those in early transition\nstages. Demands for strong forms of coordination between system elements and across\ninstitutional spheres increase. However, such systems planning raises distinct capacity and\nlegitimacy demands. The availability of robust institutions for systems planning is therefore a\nkey, hitherto neglected success factor for advanced energy transitions. To develop this\nargument empirically, we draw on an in-depth qualitative case study of the German energy\ntransition as a paradigmatic case in which successful renewable expansion has led to a\ngrowing mismatch between legacy system features and transition affordances. Attempts to\naddress this mismatch through enhanced, whole-of-system coordination oriented towards\nGermany’s net zero goal have been met with institutional barriers that increase the power of\nopponents.

This includes financial, physical and reputational elements. Despite a proliferation of experimental tools for quantifying, assessing, and monitoring impacts on biodiversity (physical materiality), there is a gap as regards reputational materiality. \n\nNature PRISM aims to complement existing approaches, by quantifying reputational materiality for industry, regulators, and investors. It is an automated data-driven tool, that assesses the perceived impact of corporate activity on biodiversity through a large-scale machine-learning analysis of publicly-available information. The tool is based on a Directed Acyclic Graph structured around a DAPSIR (Driver, Action, Pressure, State, Impact, Response) framework, providing a novel holistic approach to monitoring and reporting perceptions of biodiversity impacts. Importantly it picks up not just negative impacts, but also positive impacts and responses to biodiversity loss. \n\nWe demonstrate the potential of Nature PRISM to reveal the extent of perceived correlations between drivers and biodiversity indicators across a wide range of sectors, using a novel dataset of over three million long-form news articles, identified through a set of expert- derived and industry-standard keywords. We also demonstrate the tool's potential to become a robust and comparable sector-specific indicator using a case study of housing developments in Europe. The tool has the potential to be a new and complementary evidence-based resource for investors, policymakers, and other stakeholders to assess reputational materiality and guide business decisions, disaggregatable by sector, geography, or individual company.",

We aim to provide updated, comparative evidence on the prevalence of frequent contact (including digital) and close proximity between older parents and their children, and to assess how measurement choices affect cross-national patterns in Europe.\nMethods. We use data on 23 European countries from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe wave 9 (2021–2022) and the European Social Survey round 10 (2020–2022) to estimate the prevalence of frequent contact and close proximity across different approaches: most-contacted versus random child, any versus mode-specific contact, distance versus travel-time thresholds. Cross-national coherence is assessed with Spearman rank correlations and Kendall’s W.\nResults. We find a pronounced regional gradient: Southern Europe shows the highest levels of frequent contact and close proximity, Nordic and Continental countries the lowest, and Eastern Europe are in-between with internal heterogeneity. Digital communication is part of the intergenerational repertoire, albeit not clearly geographically patterned. Face-to-face and phone contacts remain dominant; texting is less widespread, while video calls remain rare. Measurement choices substantially shift prevalence levels but much less the ranking of countries that remains consistent also when adjusting for socio-demographics. \nDiscussion. We document persistent family-regime differences and highlight digital contact as a supplementary facet of associational solidarity. Results point to risks of a double exclusion for older adults who lack face-to-face contact and cannot exploit digital tools and underscore that survey design choices matter for levels but not ranking-based comparisons, supporting the use of random-child items in general surveys.",

The analysis estimates that Norway’s Government Pension Fund SWF added $816,089 per capita over the analysis period ($28,141/Year) to resource-rent pruned GDP per capita and 9.69% to domestic saving share of GDP (1995-2023). Singapore’s Temasek global SWF investments added $472,605 per capita over the analysis period ($22,505/Year) and 14.42% to domestic savings share of GDP (2003-2023). As expected, Australia’s smaller SWF had no significant effect on GDP. These synthetic control analysis estimates are robust to in-place and time placebos and negative control outcomes. The findings indicate that robust mandatory SWF-steered savings in open economies can accelerate economic growth beyond standard Solow model steady state equilibrium by adding a non-depreciating compound growth function to domestic investment.",

Most evidence comes from the US and majority populations, but European minorities may respond differently.

Oversampling voters with a migration background (N=1,889/3,058), among which a portion identifies as Muslim (N=649/3,058), reveals that instead of minorities, majorities are just as, if not more, likely to engage in affinity voting. Shared religion is the most influential affinity impacting Muslim and non-religious voters. Sharing the same migration background or gender has no positive impact on voting likelihood; on the contrary, the findings suggest that voters with a migration background tend to prefer politicians without a migration background. Non-religious voters exhibit an in-group preference both when voter and politician agree but especially when voter and politician disagree about policy. These findings reveal the electoral challenges to achieving diversity in politics and minority representation, particularly concerning the political inclusion of Muslims.",

This paper presents a detailed case study of Rinascimento, an innovative urban recovery program launched in Bergamo, Italy—one of the epicenters of the early pandemic. It explores how an adhocratic governance model, characterized by :lexibility, decentralization, and cross-sector collaboration, was employed to mitigate the economic impact of the crisis. The program was implemented through a public-private-nonpro:it partnership involving the Municipality of Bergamo, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank, and CESVI, a local humanitarian NGO. Drawing on collaborative governance and network theories, the Rinascimento initiative combined emergency grants and impact investment loans to support nearly 4,500 small businesses and professionals. The paper analyzes the design and operational mechanisms of the adhocracy, its rapid decision-making capabilities, and its emphasis on real-time learning and adaptation. Empirical evaluation using key performance indicators demonstrates the program’s effectiveness in enhancing business resilience, reducing business mortality rates, and fostering economic regeneration. The :indings underscore the potential of adhocratic models in municipal crisis management and offer scalable insights for future governance frameworks addressing systemic shocks.",

This study compared suicidal-related and non-suicidal sessions within a general youth chatline to identify session characteristics and worker skills associated with positive outcomes.\nMethods: We analyzed 1,710 chat sessions (202,336 messages) from QuickChat, a Singapore youth chatline between 2016 and 2020. Large language models classified sessions as suicidal or self-harm related (n=406, 24%) or non-suicidal (n=1,304, 76%). User-reported outcomes measured service quality and coping ability. Twelve therapeutic skills were coded from 79,587 worker messages. Multilevel regression models examined skill-outcome associations.\nResults: Suicidal-related sessions were significantly longer, contained more messages, and yielded lower outcomes. Suicidal ideation was most prevalent (85%), followed by self-harm (43%). In suicidal sessions, normalization demonstrated the strongest associations with all outcomes, followed by teaching/psychoeducation and making strengths explicit. These patterns differed substantially from non-suicidal sessions.\nConclusion: Suicidal-related sessions within general chatlines demand greater engagement and differentiated responses from workers. Normalization and psychoeducation emerge as effective techniques for improving outcomes in suicidal chats. These findings provide actionable guidance for training frontline workers in general youth services.",

          "abstract": "With the rise of web-based data collection, researchers are increasingly exploring how to measure cognition online, including in web surveys and video interviews. This paper provides empirical evidence on mode effects (web, in-person, video interviewing) in the measurement of cognitive abilities using the TestMyBrain Backward Digit Span test (an immediate serial recall task) among adults age 20-40 years in England. Participants completed surveys including the same cognitive test at two time points two weeks apart and were randomly allocated to mode at each wave. The 1,692 wave 1 respondents and 1,510 wave 2 respondents were analysed using mixed effects models to estimate mode effects relating to several assessment outcomes. We found that participation by web was associated with a higher likelihood of an incomplete assessment relative to both in-person and video interviewing, suggesting that the presence of an interviewer – even if not physically present as in video interviewing – enhances the likelihood of a successfully completed test. For participants who completed the cognitive assessment, we found no evidence that the observed mean scores differed by mode, though this appeared to mask some heterogeneity. Although based on small numbers, there was a trend for both web and video respondents to be more likely to obtain the highest test scores than those participating in-person. This is consistent with prior suggestions that individuals in modes where there is limited or no interviewer presence are more likely to cheat. Mean test scores were consistently higher at wave 2 than at wave 1, with this ‘retest gain’ differing little by mode. These findings contribute to the limited literature on mode effects in cognitive assessment and offer valuable insights for researchers designing and analysing mixed-mode studies.",

          "abstract": "The implications of climate change are becoming increasingly visible through its multifaceted effects, including the rising frequency and intensity of extreme temperatures and weather events such as floods, droughts and sea level rise. This study integrates longitudinal survey data from Understanding Society (2009–2023) with high-resolution flood and temperature records across the United Kingdom to examine how exposure to heatwaves and floods relates to the likelihood of conception among childless individuals of reproductive age. Using monthly-level discrete-time event history models, the analysis accounts for demographic, socio-economic, and contextual confounders, and further investigates the moderating role of  pre-existing climate change attitudes and behaviours. The results show that exposure to both types of natural hazards is associated with a temporary reduction in the monthly probability of conception. Heatwaves, in particular, show a strong and highly significant association, with conception probabilities declining sharply during months of exposure. Floods show a weaker yet still negative association, observed in the six months immediately following the event. Furthermore, environmental behaviours appear to play a moderating role in the case of floods: only individuals reporting environmentally friendly behaviours experience a temporary decline in conception probabilities after flood exposure, followed by a modest rebound thereafter. By uniquely combining individual-level panel data with localized climate information, this study goes beyond intention-based analyses to reveal how climate shocks relate to actual fertility behaviour. Overall, these findings demonstrate that climate change constitutes not only an environmental or economic challenge, but also a demographic one, with meaningful implications for fertility behaviours.",

Although significant for understanding human evolution, the rise of industrialized mass production has reduced the need for handicraft practices and their inter-generational transmission in daily life. This study thus examines toolmaking skill acquisition in 170 non-industrial societies through a comprehensive compilation and coding of ethnographic text data using the eHRAF World Cultures. Grounded in the cultural evolution theory (CET), this descriptive analysis addresses six fundamental questions: what skills are most frequently learned, who transmits this knowledge, where skill acquisition takes place, when learning occurs developmentally, how skills are acquired, and why specific individuals are chosen as models. The most important finding addresses the “why” question of major transmission biases involved in the toolmaking skill acquisition, highlighting the dominant role of kin-based transmission bias. This provides an empirical recalibration to CET modeling studies, which have traditionally emphasized conformist and success/prestige-based biases. Moreover, this project creates a valuable foundation for exploring patterns in cultural learning and technological practices across societies featuring diverse subsistence strategies, while also providing a reference framework for archaeological interpretations of past learning dynamics.",

          "authors": "Semiray Yücebas; Mesut Yücebas; Hande Topel",
          "abstract": "Diabetes affects millions of people worldwide and receives significant public attention due to its complexity and association with multiple comorbidities. However, it is often framed in public discourse as a condition stemming primarily from individual behaviors and manageable through personal lifestyle changes. The media plays a pivotal role in shaping and reinforcing such perceptions, yet its role in constructing narratives around diabetes care and responsibility remains underexplored. In this study, we conducted a qualitative content analysis of reports published in two widely circulated national newspapers in Türkiye representing opposing political orientations to examine how diabetes is represented in the media. We analyzed the framing of disease causes, risks, and treatment approaches, as well as thematic orientations and sourcing practices in news production. Our findings indicate that diabetes is consistently presented through an individualized lens across both outlets. News coverage relies heavily on single-expert sourcing, while public health perspectives, social determinants of health, and structural prevention measures receive limited attention. Conceptual imprecision in reporting frequently blurs distinctions between causes, risks, symptoms, and complications, undermining health literacy and contributing to confusion about disease prevention and management. Treatment and prevention are commonly framed through lifestyle and dietary suggestions that are weakly connected to evidence-based care. In addition, attention-grabbing narratives rarely distinguish between diabetes subtypes, further reinforcing misinterpretations of risk and responsibility. Notably, these patterns persist despite the newspapers’ opposing political orientations. Overall, the findings underscore the need for more accurate, contextualized, and evidence-informed health communication on diabetes.",

          "abstract": "Family Group Conferences (FGCs) in children’s services are convened meetings of family networks to make plans for a child who is in need or at risk. There remain gaps in evidence, including how variation in implementation context affects FGC experiences and outcomes. The Family Views and Context Study is part of a wider realist-informed evaluation (Family VOICE). It involved 380 individuals who had attended FGCs, from 155 families across the UK. Family members completed questionnaires at three time points, including standardised measures for self-efficacy, family functioning, adult well-being and child psychosocial health. FGC coordinators also completed questionnaires. This paper focuses on one key aspect of variation in implementation context, namely the stage of child welfare concern. Three categories are compared: (1) early help and child in need; (2) child protection and edge of care; and (3) children in state care. In addition to questionnaires, a sub-group of participants (n=25) took part in semi-structured interviews, purposively sampled for these three stages of concern. Quantitative comparisons found almost no significant differences between the three categories in family experiences or outcomes. Qualitative interviews suggested more similarities than differences in participant experiences, perceptions of FGC mechanisms, and intended outcomes, across the three categories.",

          "abstract": "Forming an understanding of the extent to which individuals realise their short-term fertility intentions is essential in terms of grasping the dynamics behind persistently low fertility in Europe. This study examines the realisation of fertility intentions within a three-year period across four Central European countries (Czechia, Poland, Austria and Germany) employing data from the two waves of the Generations and Gender Survey (2005–2015). The study focuses on men and women aged 18–39 and includes both childless individuals and parents aimed at capturing differences in terms of the realisation of fertility intentions at distinct stages of the family life course. Its main contribution lies in examining whether and how the age of the youngest child is associated with the realisation of the fertility intentions of parents. The results reveal that the odds of parents realising their fertility intentions decline substantially as the youngest child grows older, thus suggesting the existence of a relatively narrow time window following a birth for the realisation of intentions to have another child, a factor that has important implications for the design of (tempo-related) family policies. In addition, the study shows that while economic conditions influence the realisation of short-term fertility intentions to have a child for childless individuals, they lose their significance for parents. By uncovering the central role of the child’s age in terms of the realisation of fertility intentions, this study contributes to the demographic research on timing and parity-specific fertility behaviour and has important implications for the formation of family policies aimed at supporting higher-order (especially second) births.",

Para ayudar a reducir esta brecha, este estudio cuantitativo analiza los factores que influyen en la confianza en los medios, centrándose en diferencias por edad y género. Mediante una encuesta en línea (n=2,005) y pruebas no paramétricas de Mann-Whitney y Kruskal-Wallis, se hallaron diferencias significativas por edad en siete de ocho factores analizados. Los grupos de mayor edad, especialmente aquellos entre 50 y 64 años, valoran más la trayectoria histórica de los medios, sus estándares periodísticos, la transparencia informativa y la alineación con sus valores personales al momento de decidir en qué medios confiar. En contraste, el género no fue una variable determinante, excepto en la valoración de la trayectoria histórica, donde las mujeres tienden a darle más importancia que los hombres. Estos hallazgos pueden informar el desarrollo de estrategias orientadas a incrementar los niveles de confianza en los medios de comunicación en el Perú, donde los índices de confianza son uno de los más bajos de América Latina.",

          "abstract": "Puri Agung Ubud is one of the traditional Balinese palaces that functions as a living cultural heritage (living monument) as well as an important cultural tourism attraction in Ubud, Gianyar. The pressure of modern tourism has encouraged various forms of architectural adaptation, both in spatial function, physical form, materials, and socio-cultural utilization patterns within the palace. This study aims to identify architectural adaptation strategies that occur at Puri Agung Ubud, analyze their impact on cultural values and traditional architecture, and formulate conservation directions that are integrated with the development of sustainable cultural tourism. The research method used is descriptive qualitative through field observations, physical measurements, visual documentation, in-depth interviews with puri administrators and cultural figures, and analysis of relevant documents. The analysis is carried out by linking the concepts of Tri Mandala, Sanga Mandala, and Tri Hita Karana to the puri's spatial system, and applying Schmidt &amp; Austin's typology of adaptation strategies (adjustable, versatile, refitable, convertible, scalable, movable) to four main palebahan: Ancak Saji, Semanggen, Rangki, and Saren Agung. The results of this study indicate that Puri Agung Ubud is able to maintain its traditional spatial macrostructure and sacred-cosmological orientation, while selectively adapting through changes in spatial functions, hybrid construction techniques, and transformation of architectural elements to accommodate tourism needs, without completely eliminating its authentic value. The main findings indicate that controlled adaptation based on critical conservation has the potential to strengthen the palace's sustainability as a cultural heritage, on the one hand by maintaining traditional practices and on the other hand by opening economic and educational opportunities through cultural tourism. This article offers a framework for architectural adaptation strategies for similar cultural heritage sites in Bali that face similar pressures from global tourism.",

          "authors": "Zaelani Zaelani",
          "abstract": "Indonesia and many other nations present a paradox: high levels of religiosity coexist with systematic patterns of fraud and financial exploitation targeting religious communities. This paper develops a theoretical framework to explain mechanisms of trust exploitation in religious-collectivist communities, with empirical focus on documented fraud cases in Indonesia and the Southeast Asian region. Drawing on synthesis of literature regarding particularized versus generalized trust in social psychology, affinity fraud documentation in fraud prevention research, victimization theory, and empirical case studies, this paper identifies three interacting mechanisms. First, trust calibration mismatch reveals how lived experience in high-trust environments develops trust heuristics optimal for in-group contexts but vulnerable when out-group actors adopt in-group signals. Second, religious rationalization encompasses assumptions about religious deterrence and delegation of justice to God, reducing urgency for verification or formal reporting. Third, temporal familiarity exploitation demonstrates how perpetrators systematically build long-term relationships before large financial extraction. These three mechanisms generate an opportunity structure aligned with Fraud Triangle theory, where detection probability and punishment probability remain low while payoffs are substantial. This paper maintains a critical distinction between religious teachings (which explicitly prohibit deception) and religious identity as social signal (which can be exploited). The vulnerability analyzed is contextual rather than inherent to religiosity itself, emerging from specific configuration of high collectivism, religiosity as dominant identity marker, weak formal institutions, and strong social harmony norms. The framework is exploratory, grounded in existing literature and documented cases, and invites future empirical validation while offering implications for financial literacy education, fraud prevention policy, and institutional strengthening in religious communities.",

          "abstract": "El presente estudio integra el análisis de dos escaladas geopolíticas contemporáneas (Trump-Maduro 2025 y Trump-Petro 2025-2026) desde una perspectiva psicoanalítica freudiana, examinando cómo las dinámicas de narcisismo patológico, agresión y pulsión de muerte se manifiestan en el liderazgo político contemporáneo. Mediante un análisis cualitativo comparativo basado en los conceptos freudianos de narcisismo, agresión como pulsión fundamental, y el conflicto irresoluble entre Eros y Tánatos en la civilización, se exploran las continuidades entre la teoría psicoanalítica clásica y las crisis geopolíticas actuales. Los resultados sugieren que el narcisismo patológico en líderes con acceso a poder militar masivo representa una manifestación contemporánea del \"malestar en la cultura\" freudiano: la civilización tecnológica ha amplificado exponencialmente las capacidades destructivas humanas sin proporcionar mecanismos equivalentes para la regulación de impulsos agresivos narcisistas. El estudio examina cómo la asimetría de poder, la provocación calculada, y la imposibilidad psicológica de retroceso en líderes narcisistas crean dinámicas de escalada que trascienden la racionalidad estratégica. Se discuten las implicaciones de los planteamientos freudianos sobre la guerra, la agresión y las limitaciones de la razón civilizatoria para comprender y potencialmente mitigar crisis contemporáneas donde personalidades patológicas controlan arsenales destructivos. El análisis concluye que la pregunta freudiana \"¿Por qué la guerra?\" permanece vigente en el siglo XXI, requiriendo una integración de comprensión psicoanalítica con salvaguardas institucionales para proteger a la civilización de sus propios líderes.",

          "authors": "João Henrique Santana Stacciarini",
          "abstract": "Desde a descoberta da penicilina por Alexander Fleming, em 1928, o setor farmacêutico expandiu-se de modo acelerado, tornando-se, na atualidade, um dos segmentos mais poderosos da economia global, com faturamento anual estimado em cerca de US$ 1,5 trilhão e grandes corporações avaliadas em centenas de bilhões de dólares. Embora avanços científico-tecnológicos e transformações socioeconômicas tenham impulsionado a pesquisa e o desenvolvimento de medicamentos, contribuindo para ganhos relevantes, a literatura crítica tem destacado práticas controversas de influência corporativa – aqui sintetizadas como “Influência, Desvios e Excessos” – que favorecem o crescimento, a rentabilidade e a consolidação de poder, por vezes em conflito com o interesse coletivo e a saúde pública. Nesse contexto, este artigo adota delineamento exploratório-descritivo e abordagem mista, com triangulação entre dados públicos, documentos institucionais e revisão crítica da literatura internacional, a fim de mapear e descrever mecanismos de influência corporativa no setor farmacêutico em oito eixos: (i) lobby e financiamento eleitoral; (ii) influência em órgãos de regulação e fiscalização; (iii) influência em organizações de pacientes; (iv) influência na elaboração de diretrizes clínicas; (v) manipulação, promoção e ocultação de pesquisas e testes de medicamentos; (vi) escrita fantasma; (vii) estratégias de ampliação diagnóstica e promoção de doenças; e (viii) financiamento e oferta de benefícios a prescritores e instituições, incluindo mecanismos psicossociais e dimensões formativas. Os achados indicam que a influência corporativa se estrutura em múltiplas escalas e opera de forma simultaneamente visível e difusa. No plano político, evidencia-se a centralidade do lobby e do financiamento eleitoral como instrumentos de conformação do ambiente normativo e regulatório, com expansão progressiva dos investimentos. Na esfera regulatória, a recorrência de conflitos de interesse em comitês consultivos e a circulação de quadros entre agências e empresas sugerem vulnerabilidades à captura institucional, com implicações para os processos de aprovação, fiscalização e retirada de medicamentos. No domínio científico, o patrocínio industrial associa-se a vieses que podem incidir desde o desenho e a condução de ensaios até a publicação seletiva de resultados, além de práticas como ghostwriting e estratégias de “preparação de mercado”, afetando a credibilidade e a circulação das evidências. Em paralelo, observa-se a atuação da indústria na expansão diagnóstica e na medicalização de condições da vida cotidiana, ampliando mercados e podendo invisibilizar determinantes sociais e abordagens não farmacológicas. Na prática clínica, pagamentos e transferências de valor a prescritores e instituições de ensino associam-se a mudanças nos padrões de prescrição, aumento de custos e favorecimento de medicamentos promovidos, inclusive por meio de benefícios de baixo valor, mediados por vieses cognitivos.",

          "abstract": "Reports of online grooming, sexual extortion, and child sexual abuse material have increased markedly. Public reactions to news stories frequently point to inattentive parenting as the cause, even though studies show that many offenses are committed by people the child already knows, including juvenile peers and family members, and that today’s parents are far more involved in children’s daily lives than those of past generations. This chapter examines why public conversations about online crimes against children often attribute blame to neglectful parenting despite evidence of more complicated situations.\n\nThe chapter first reviews what is currently known about family environments, parenting practices, and online children victimization, then draws on the Life Course Perspective for insight on online risks and public perceptions of them. From this framework, children’s online vulnerability is less a function of parental vigilance than of current historical contexts including sociocultural lag. As such, preventative programs must take into account these factors. Additional Life Course principles help explain why families and observers may struggle to understand what it means to “protect children online.” The aim is to view family-level prevention, and calls for it, within social and technological systems rather than treating parents, or any other single group, as a primary line of defense against online child predation.",

We introduce the Criminal Nucleation Framework to model the emergence and persistence of criminal cells through three dimensions: the institutional activation barrier (ΔG), the critical organizational size (r*), and the growth constant (k). Empirical validation shows a structural rupture between 2007 and 2010, where homicide rates shifted from a stable regime (8.5–10 per 100k) to a chronic state (25–29 per 100k). By operationalizing a comparative Kinetic Risk Index (R = k/ΔG), the framework classifies cities into distinct systemic states rather than providing point predictions. The findings suggest that once a system exhibits hysteresis, reactive force is structurally insufficient; instead, policy must focus on increasing the activation barrier to prevent spontaneous criminal formation.",

          "abstract": "The rapid expansion of e-commerce has transformed consumer purchasing behaviour in developing economies; however, concerns related to perceived risk and trust continue to hinder the widespread adoption of online shopping. This study examines the influence of perceived risk factors on online shopping behaviour in Pakistan within a post-COVID e-commerce context. Drawing on the Theory of Planned Behavior and perceived risk theory, the study investigates the effects of financial risk, product risk, convenience risk, non-delivery risk, and return policy risk on consumers’ online shopping behaviour.\nA quantitative research design was employed using primary survey data collected in 2021 from university students and working professionals in major urban centres of Pakistan. Responses were manually screened for completeness and analysed using descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and multiple regression analysis. The findings indicate that financial risk and non-delivery risk exert the strongest negative influence on online shopping behaviour, while product risk and convenience risk also significantly affect consumers’ purchasing decisions. Return policy risk demonstrates a weaker but still relevant effect.\nThe study contributes empirical evidence from a developing-country context and highlights the continued importance of perceived risk in shaping online consumer behaviour in post-pandemic digital markets. The findings offer practical implications for e-commerce platforms, logistics providers, and policymakers seeking to strengthen consumer trust and promote sustainable growth in Pakistan’s digital economy.",

          "authors": "Jiefeng Kang; Yusong Xie; Takahiro TSUGE; Takahiro KUBO",
          "abstract": "Tourism and everyday life increasingly intersect in destination spaces, yet existing studies rarely capture how local people and tourists generate unequal access to services through their distinct mobility patterns. This study introduces a trajectory-based spatiotemporal mismatch (TBSTM) framework that links group-specific mobility rhythms to the spatial and temporal distribution of facilities. Using Amami Oshima, Japan, as a case, we integrate a year-long high-resolution mobility trajectory dataset with mobility network analysis, multimodal accessibility modelling, and a standardized trajectory-based supply-demand index to evaluate disparities in service access for both groups. Results show a clear dual structure of inequality. Local people experience persistent, place-specific shortages in essential services, particularly education, healthcare, and administrative functions-concentrated in peripheral communities such as North, Uken, and Kakeromajima. Tourists, in contrast, face seasonal and service-specific deficits in accommodation, food, and tourism amenities, which intensify from quarter 2 to quarter 4 around gateways and major tourist attractions. Network analysis further indicates that local people provide the stable backbone of the island’s mobility system, whereas tourist flows temporarily thicken key nodes without altering overall connectivity. The study extends spatial mismatch theory by embedding dynamic, group-specific mobility evidence into an operational TBSTM framework. It also offers a foundation for dynamic adaptive governance, enabling timely and targeted interventions to enhance equity and resilience in tourism-dependent destinations.",

          "abstract": "Affordable housing has become a major concern to many governments. The debate in this area has extremely grown both nationally and internationally after a series of recorded ballooning of population and the mushrooming of informal settlements in the environs of our cities and towns. This study seeks to explore the project design and implementation of affordable housing projects in Nairobi metropolis, Kenya. The objectives considered in this study are: To establish the influence of Project Financing Design and to check the moderating role of Regulatory framework between Project design and the implementation of affordable housing projects in Nairobi metropolis, Kenya. To achieve the set objectives, the study develops research hypotheses and was statistically tested at α = 0.05. The theories on which the study was hinged are stakeholder’s theory and open system theory. The study adopts a descriptive research design, and used both qualitative and quantitative approaches. The study looked at a population of 11 affordable housing projects in Nairobi metropolis with 101,565 number of units. Census sampling used a sample of 220 professionals working on the affordable housing projects. These officials are directly involved with project design and the implementation of affordable housing in Nairobi metropolis, Kenya. The study used open-ended and closed-ended questionnaire as the main mode of data collection. Primary data was collected using structured questionnaires. Secondary data was collected from institutional documents, State Department of Housing and Urban Development publications, and relevant publications in referred journals. The collected data was edited, coded and entered into SPSS software for analysis. Data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. In particular, Regression Analysis was used to investigate the relationships between hypothesized variables. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was also used to investigate whether independent variables have a combined effect on the dependent variable. The data was analyzed through the use of descriptive statistics. ANOVA, t-test, Pearson correlation, p- values and coefficient of determination. Data was presented using frequency tables, figures, graphs and pie charts. This study examined the factors influencing affordable housing implementation in Nairobi metropolis, focusing on Project Financing Design and Regulatory Framework. The research found that all these factors significantly impact housing project success, with Project Financing Design  having the strongest positive effect (29.8% increase per unit improvement). The study emphasizes the importance of integrating environmental considerations, developing robust financing strategies, streamlining regulatory processes, and ensuring effective technical planning in housing initiatives.",

          "authors": "songping zeng",
          "abstract": "This paper presents a systematic study of the “Eight-Cord Pattern Pottery Plate” unearthed from the Liu Linxi site in Hubei Province, arguing that it serves as the material prototype of the lost ancient canonical text, the Ba Suo. The pottery plate constructs a standard eight-direction spatial framework through its orderly “eight-cord pattern,” representing the archetype of the “Eight Trigrams Plate.” Its symbol system precisely encodes the “Eight Solar Terms,” including the two equinoxes, two solstices, and the four seasonal commencements, constituting a sophisticated “solar calendar.” Furthermore, through unique symbolic combinations such as “Wu (五)-Tian (田),” it transforms astronomical nodes into rigid agricultural instructions, forming a “Charter of Agricultural Timings.” This research achieves a complete mutual verification between the artifact and the Ba Suo as recorded in later texts (“the theory of the Eight Trigrams, seeking its meaning”) from the triple dimensions of “name, substance, and meaning.” The study reveals that the “Eight-Cord Pattern Pottery Plate” is not a divination instrument, but rather a “pre-literary comprehensive codex” integrating cosmology, scientific observation, and administrative decree. It signifies that around 7000 years ago, Chinese civilization had achieved a crucial leap from mystical symbols to rational governance, significantly predating the empirical evidence for systematic knowledge and advanced governance models in Chinese civilization.",

          "abstract": "This article presents a structural theory of faculty governance decline in contemporary universities. Drawing on historical analysis and a review of comparative literature, the study argues that administrative dominance emerges not as institutional pathology but as rational adaptation to specific convergent conditions. Five structural factors are identified: the collapse of epistemic authority, institutional scale and heterogeneity, an intensified risk environment, the fragmentation of faculty as a collective class, and mission substitution dynamics. When these conditions converge, faculty governance becomes structurally impossible rather than merely politically undermined. The analysis synthesizes findings from recent cross-national studies documenting decollegialization, managerialism, and corporatization trends. The article concludes that reversing administrative expansion requires addressing the structural configuration that makes faculty governance unviable, rather than pursuing reforms within existing frameworks. This reframing carries significant implications for higher education policy and institutional design.",

The pervasive reliance on commercial social media platforms for political communication, while offering broad reach, has enabled environments that actively promote algorithmic bias, accelerate misinformation, and leave users vulnerable to impersonation and identity theft. I argue that these issues pose a significant threat by eroding public trust and fragmenting the essential dialogue between elected officials and the citizens they serve. I propose a novel approach: a dedicated, government-backed digital platform providing every elected official with an individual, officially verified channel for concise, primarily one-way, text-based updates, designed to be an authoritative broadcast channel supplemented by separate mechanisms for structured citizen feedback. This system aims to circumvent the pitfalls of commercial platforms, offering a transparent and authoritative source of information that is easily searchable, fosters greater accountability, and offers robust protection against impersonation and identity theft, thereby strengthening the essential connection between representatives and the represented.",

          "abstract": "Open access has triumphed in the dissemination of research, making it widely available and discoverable beyond the confines of journal enclosures. The current challenge lies not in access, but in evaluation. While dissemination has evolved, scholarly judgment systems remain ensnared by opaque and anonymous gatekeeping. This study contends that governance, rather than quality, is the core issue. By synthesizing the literature on citations, trust, prestige, and scholarly behavior, we demonstrate that open research is extensively used, cited, and trusted by researchers. Journal branding serves as a residual signal, yet evaluative authority remains confined within closed processes that are misaligned with the ways knowledge is produced, encountered, and assessed. In response, we propose Governance by Guide (GG), a model for evaluating preprint-based scholarly commons. This model replaces gatekeeping with open, attributed guidance; rejection with non-erasure; and final verdicts with public records of critique and response. Evaluation becomes an additive process of stewardship rather than an act of certification. The ultimate evaluative authority rests with the sovereign reader empowered by transparency. We conclude that sustaining a credible open scholarly commons requires abandoning journal-centered certification in favor of transparent, community-governed evaluation. The GG offers a practical framework for achieving this realignment, aligning scholarly authority with openness, accountability, and lived research practice.",

In this paper, I introduce Conserved Attention Theory (CAT), in which attention is defined as the per-actor, per-instant allocation of bounded processing resources, idealized as fully allocated and zero-sum. Allocations leave physical traces (artifacts) in actors and external environments that bias future allocation in a feedback loop. Attention space is an actor’s individually-instantiated associative topology across potential allocation biases, both internal and external. I demonstrate that the convergence of overlapping attention spaces is sufficient for social patterns and behavior to emerge without the requirement of a separate ontological social layer. I show that attention spaces and emergent social consequences remain subject to thermodynamics and entropy. This framework provides a physically grounded approach to reframe social phenomena like social polarization in physical terms rather than as rational or moral failures.",

          "abstract": "Affordable housing remains a critical development challenge in rapidly urbanizing cities, particularly in developing economies. Nairobi Metropolis continues to experience a persistent housing deficit characterized by project delays, cost overruns, quality compromises, and occasional structural failures, despite sustained public and private sector interventions. This study examined the influence of Environmental Assessment Design as a project design practice on the implementation of affordable housing projects in Nairobi Metropolis, Kenya, and further assessed the moderating role of the Regulatory Framework on this relationship. Anchored on a pragmatist research philosophy, the study adopted a descriptive and explanatory research design, utilizing quantitative methods. Primary data were collected from key stakeholders involved in affordable housing projects, including project managers, consultants, contractors, and regulatory officers. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and hierarchical multiple regression analysis to test both direct and moderating effects. The findings revealed that Environmental Assessment Design had a statistically significant positive influence on the implementation of affordable housing projects, explaining 26.9% of the variance in implementation outcomes. When the Regulatory Framework was introduced as a moderating variable, the explanatory power of the model increased substantially to 56.8%, indicating a strong enhancement effect. The interaction between Environmental Assessment Design and the Regulatory Framework was positive and significant, confirming that effective regulatory support strengthened the impact of environmental assessment practices on project implementation. The study concluded that successful implementation of affordable housing projects is not only dependent on sound environmental and technical design but is significantly shaped by the effectiveness of regulatory frameworks. Strengthening environmental assessment processes alongside coherent, well-enforced regulatory mechanisms is therefore critical for improving project delivery. The study recommends enhanced regulatory coordination, streamlined approval processes, and capacity building for project and regulatory institutions. Further research is suggested across other metropolitan counties, with additional moderating variables and longitudinal designs to enrich understanding of sustainable affordable housing implementation.",

          "authors": "Zaelani Zaelani",
          "abstract": "A documented mental health crisis affects 33% of Indonesian adolescents, with only 2.6% accessing professional services. Secondary education systems demonstrate persistent gaps between identified mental health needs and institutional capacity to respond. This study employs autoethnographic analysis integrated with systematic engagement of peer-reviewed literature to examine institutional mechanisms through which policy failures cascade into individual psychological distress. Research reveals that surveillance failures are not implementation gaps but structurally produced through educational paternalism, conformity-enforcing social systems, chronic cognitive dissonance in critical thinkers, cognitive impairment resulting from burnout, suppression of authentic identity, and systematic teacher mental health literacy deficits. The analysis yields three principal contributions: (1) a cascading crisis model demonstrating how structural policy failures transmit through institutional, social, cognitive, and psychological levels; (2) reconceptualization of anxiety and critical thinking as accurate threat detection rather than individual pathology in genuinely toxic environments; and (3) autoethnographic evidence of student perspective systematically absent from policy discourse. Methodologically, the study demonstrates autoethnography's capacity to generate institutional knowledge through insider access to dynamics invisible to conventional research methods. The research generalizes patterns identified across multiple Indonesian secondary education contexts, with policy implications for mandatory educator mental health literacy training, prevention-oriented rather than crisis-driven systems, embedding mental health within educational policy infrastructure, and substantive inclusion of student voice in program design. The study makes urgent case that psychological harm documented in adolescent populations is not inevitable consequence of schooling but result of specific institutional choices choices amenable to reform.",

In the Chinese case, the governance of arbitration is placed within a regulatory arena driven by administrative supervision, judicialization of arbitration procedures, and deep judicial review, causing a tension between contract principles. In this study, a legal and development orientation is adopted to examine the Chinese arbitration system, arguing that the above tension is part of a broader challenge faced by transitional approaches to harmonize dispute resolution practices and market governance and rule of law aspirations. It proposes an institutional reform led by a conceptual map of three core principles: decreasing administrative supervision over arbitration governance in terms of market reform principles; adjusting the adversary practices of litigation within arbitration governance in terms of empowerment and personal legislation; and evolving a judicial supervision approach featuring a teamwork scheme and preferential procedural analysis over deep judicial interventionism.

          "abstract": "Embodied and relational approaches to socio-emotional development increasingly emphasize lived experience, interaction, and situated awareness, yet few frameworks systematically integrate movement-based practices with established psychotherapeutic theory. This theoretical review examines the convergence between Argentine Tango (tango) and Gestalt Therapy (GT), proposing an embodied, relational framework for socio-emotional development and relational awareness. Tango is conceptualized as an improvisational, dyadic practice that operationalizes core GT principles, including contact, field regulation, phenomenological awareness, experiential cycling, and creative adjustment. Drawing on empirical findings from psychology, neuroscience, and movement science, the review synthesizes evidence indicating that tango participation supports emotional regulation, empathy, social bonding, embodied awareness, and motor-cognitive integration. Through this synthesis, tango is positioned as a structured somatic laboratory for experiential GT processes and relational learning, offering a concrete context in which therapeutic mechanisms unfold in vivo. Despite promising outcomes, existing research remains predominantly outcome-focused, and systematic, process-oriented investigation of tango’s specific mechanisms of change is limited. This framework establishes a foundation for future interdisciplinary research and applied exploration of tango-informed GT practice across therapeutic, educational, and movement-based contexts.",

          "abstract": "In an era in which most organizations are not explicitly built around racist aims and most organizational actors do not admit racial bias, how do racial inequalities nevertheless persist? In recent years, research scholarship fusing race and organizational theories has made an important analytical intervention: Organizations are not merely venues of racial animus and racial inequality but, rather, race is constitutive of organizations. But contra Ray’s (2019) emphasis on attending to “broadly shared racial schemas,” this paper employs Durkheim’s notion of sacred–profane divisions to argue that analysts should focus on the case-specific issue of the binary divisions that define legitimacy within a particular organizational field. It is via hallowed institutional categories that organizations produce, encode, and obscure racial disparities and meanings. To illustrate the potential and flexibility of such an approach, this paper takes up the case of the alternative food sector, drawing on 11 months of ethnographic research at a large farmers market and analysis of four decades of organizational records. Findings reveal how the racial order is reinforced not only through racial animus and racial schemas, but it also unfolds via the most ordinary of this market’s organizational pathways, from membership lists, certifications, and placement in geographical space. Importantly, these racialized dynamics would neither be observed nor explained by prevailing organizational frameworks of racial stratification.",

          "abstract": "First documented in 1930, the Black–White mortality crossover remains one of the most enduring puzzles in Demography. Black Americans experience higher age-specific mortality rates than White Americans throughout most of the life course, yet this pattern reverses at advanced ages. A leading explanation is that there is no crossover at all. Rather, differential age misreporting or other data errors create a spurious crossover. We use a large-scale administrative cohort dataset of American men (N = 2.3 million deaths) to assess whether the Black–White mortality crossover is real or an artifact of data error. We find a mortality crossover for the male birth cohorts of 1890–1905 at age 86. At age 75, Black men have nearly a 10% higher probability of dying than White men, but by age 95, the probability of dying is 8% higher for White men. The quality of our mortality data, paired with a series of sensitivity analyses, provides new evidence that the observed crossover is not an artifact of age misreporting. Our findings address a long-standing empirical debate and emphasize the need for further investigation into alternative explanations of the crossover, including selective survival mechanisms and reversals of group-specific disadvantage at advanced ages.",

For over a decade, federal mandates have required researchers to consider sex, gender, and diversity in their studies—yet no one has systematically verified whether these requirements translate into practice. The result is a system that may be producing research fundamentally misaligned with the population it claims to serve. When clinical trials and health studies fail to include representative samples, the treatments and interventions they validate may work differently—or not at all—for excluded groups. This is not merely an equity concern; it is a validity crisis that undermines the scientific foundation of Canadian healthcare.\nOur assessment of global health datasets and Canadian research infrastructure reveals that this problem stems not from researcher indifference, but from a critical gap between policy aspirations and operational capacity. Institutions lack the digital tools to measure diversity, leaving them unable to identify—let alone correct—systematic exclusions. Addressing this requires moving beyond compliance narratives toward investment in auditing infrastructure that can objectively verify representativeness.",

For Canadian governments, forests are sites of timber extraction that sustain industry. Canadian legislators fail to see the forest for the trees. This case study examines cumulative impacts of Ontario’s forestry legislation on Anishinaabek life ways, focusing our study on food ways. Food ways include cultural, economic, scientific, linguistic, spiritual, and intergenerational dimensions of food in a society. Anishinaabek food ways are affirmed in the 1850 Robinson Huron Treaty, a land sharing agreement between the Anishinaabek Nation and the British Crown. Crown responsibilities for resource ‘management’ was given to Provinces following the BNA Act (1867). We demonstrate ways Ontario forestry legislation disregards the Crown’s Treaty-affirmed obligations to uphold Anishinaabek harvesting rights. This case study begins with Elders’ reflections on glyphosate use in forestry. Forest operators claim herbicide use speeds commercial species regeneration, yet this strategy converts food and medicine-bearing forests to pine plantations lacking the biodiversity upon which Anishinaabek food ways depend. We ask how changes to Ontario’s forestry legislation impact Crown obligations under the Robinson Huron Treaty (1850) to protect Anishinaabek food ways. We examine limitations of settler colonial knowledge systems for understanding the impacts of forest ‘management’ decisions. This research demonstrates a need for settler scholars and forest practitioners to update their understandings of Crown responsibilities through Indigenous peoples’ Treaty perspectives. Respecting Anishinaabek food ways means adjusting how settler society views forests.",

It considers the interdependencies of employment, family life, and earning positions over the life course, relevant due to pension privatization in Europe.\nGPGs occur because privileged life courses (stable civil servant careers for public and high-income employment for private pensions) yield high pensions but are almost exclusively accessible by fathers. Gender differences in access to high-income careers for parents drive the GPG in private pensions more than the gap in public pensions.

          "abstract": "In digital capitalism, attention is often regarded as a measurable economic resource, although its conceptual definition remains unstable across various scientific disciplines. This study contends that quantifying attention functions not as an impartial measurement but as a fundamental epistemic framework that dictates what can be understood about attention. By examining proxy-based metrics such as engagement and watch time, it illustrates how these computable indicators gain authoritative status within platform infrastructures, ultimately defining attention rather than merely estimating it. Through an exploration of YouTube’s watch-time economy, this study reveals how a proxy metric is integrated into feedback loops that connect algorithmic optimization, creator efforts, and user actions, creating a self-perpetuating epistemic cycle in which the metric shapes the reality it purports to measure. In this system, issues such as cognitive overload, creative exhaustion, and attentional fatigue do not manifest as quantifiable costs but arise as epistemic externalities—systematically produced yet obscured by the metric’s one-sided logic of accumulation. This study further asserts that this epistemic imbalance extends beyond individual platforms, altering the conditions of democratic attention. The forms of attention crucial to democratic life–sustained, integrative, and deliberative–remain inherently unquantifiable within engagement-focused systems and are thus excluded from institutional recognition and value. Consequently, attention quantification is not merely an economic tactic but a transformation of democracy’s epistemic foundations. Addressing these impacts necessitates interrogating the epistemic authority of proxy-based metrics rather than refining them within the existing framework.",

          "abstract": "Integrating two U.S. datasets – the Climate Change in the American Mind survey of climate change attitudes and the Council on Environmental Quality's Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool – we explore climate change-related beliefs and attitudes among people located in areas at disproportionate risk of harm from global warming (i.e., frontline communities, or FLC) compared with those not in FLC. Overall, we find nearly two-thirds of people in both FLC and non-FLC are worried about global warming, but the level of worry does not differ significantly between them. People in FLC have slightly greater worry about several climate change impacts, but they are not more likely to say they have personally experienced global warming. People in FLC are less likely to talk about global warming or hear about it in the media. Additional geographic analysis reveals variation in the relationships between FLC status and global warming worry by county.",

          "authors": "Nicola Righetti; Petro Tolochko; Aytalina Kulichkina; Azade Kakavand; Daisuke Nakamura; Yuru Li; Paul Pressmann; Stephanie Geise; Annie Waldherr",
          "abstract": "This study examines the advantages of longitudinal modeling over cross-sectional approaches for analyzing social media engagement, specifically exploring how emotional reactions—particularly anger—influence content sharing. While cross-sectional methods are commonly used, engagement patterns are inherently temporal, making longitudinal approaches more appropriate. These methods offer a middle ground between simple cross-sectional analyses and complex time-series techniques, reducing omitted variable bias and accounting for time-varying factors like algorithmic amplification while accommodating irregular social media data. \nWe empirically compare these approaches using 1,137 environmentally themed Facebook posts from German political parties during the 2021 federal election, focusing on Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) and Die Grünen (The Greens), parties with opposing environmental policies. Cross-sectional estimates using three sampling strategies were compared with longitudinal results via Bayesian multilevel regression with negative binomial specification.\nFindings reveal that longitudinal modeling produces more conservative and precise estimates, while cross-sectional methods tend to inflate effect sizes and interparty differences. Although all models show anger positively associates with sharing for AfD and negatively for Die Grünen, longitudinal analysis provides greater inferential stability by controlling for time-invariant confounders. Such differences have important theoretical implications, underscoring the value of incorporating temporal dynamics into social media research while acknowledging data access challenges.",

          "authors": "Shigenori Tanaka",
          "abstract": "This paper challenges the conventional dualism of \"real versus digital,\" proposing a state of interpenetration where both domains are inseparably integrated within human cognition. Utilizing sense-making theory, the author argues that meaning is generated through memory chains that do not fundamentally distinguish between physical and digital experiences. To systematically analyze this integration, the research applies the Quatro Dynamic Thinking model, which explores the four dimensions of depth, breadth, relationships, and time. The paper examines how interpenetration manifests in practical domains such as healthcare, labor, and social problem-solving, revealing a transition from digital tools to embodied cognitive extensions. It elucidates a new mode of human existence within the \"interreal world,\" where psychological and social realities often supersede traditional ontological boundaries. While acknowledging the benefits of this fusion, the paper warns of risks like the \"accumulation of cognitive debt\" and the atrophy of thinking skills due to AI dependency. Ultimately, it advocates for cultivating multidimensional thinking to ensure humans remain the primary agents of meaning-making in an increasingly digitalized reality",

          "abstract": "Sustainability competitions are widely used as soft governance instruments, yet organisational engagement varies considerably. This study explains this variation by examining managerial sensemaking. Drawing on interviews with senior managers from 16 European destinations, the study shows that engagement is shaped by how tourist destination managers interpret the purpose and relevance of competitions through organisational identity orientations. Identity orientations determine whether competitions are treated as meaningful governance mechanisms or as marginal compliance or reputational exercises. We identify five sensemaking configurations that explain variation between substantive, learning-oriented engagement and selective or symbolic responses, and show that these configurations may shift over time as organisational experiences and contexts change.",

          "abstract": "Survey research yields the surprising conclusion that voters strategically abandon small parties to a similar degree in first-past-the-post (FPTP) and proportional representation (PR) systems. If true, this challenges Duverger's classic theory that strategic voting helps explain why PR systems have more parties. We argue instead that observational analyses of FPTP and PR elections produce similar patterns of apparently strategic voter behavior because they suffer from the same methodological flaw.  After reproducing previous findings in a more comprehensive dataset, we show via placebo tests that the same research design would erroneously imply strategic behavior in non-strategic outcomes like party identification. We also show that a more rigorous design reduces but does not eliminate the problem. Our findings suggest that isolating the effect of party popularity on vote choice using observational data may be fundamentally more difficult than the literature has recognized, and that alternative approaches are needed.",

          "abstract": "This study examines device effects on response behaviour and data quality in the Czech Generations and Gender Survey, Wave II, using keystroke-level paradata from a fully mobile-optimised CAWI instrument. We compare respondents completing the survey on PCs/laptops and smartphones across indicators capturing cognitive load, satisficing, and respondent effort, including response latency, completion time, answer changes, page revisits, item nonresponse, midpoint use, “don’t know” responses, and straightlining. Descriptive analyses and multivariate models controlling for age, gender, and education show that most device differences are small or negligible. Smartphone use is not associated with longer completion times or systematically lower engagement once demographic composition is accounted for. The only robust and substantively meaningful device effect is a higher incidence of straightlining among smartphone respondents, alongside a very small increase in item nonresponse. Education consistently attenuates device-related differences. Overall, the findings indicate broad comparability across devices in a mobile-optimised survey, while highlighting specific behavioural domains where smartphones continue to shape response processes.",

          "abstract": "Language acts as a bridge for understanding the world, yet the precise mechanics of language generation remain unclear. This study delves into the world-engaged Cognitive Process and Information Processing Model (CPIPM), arguing that language's intentionality is inherent to itself, acquired through training within a world-involving context. This view resonates with the philosophical insights of Martin Heidegger and Ludwig Wittgenstein. When an agent equipped with the CPIPM algorithm is initially outfitted with perceptual sensors and preset with primary needs, it can generate language in accordance with the algorithm. In subsequent cognitive processes, the agent is capable of achieving re-cognition through language, thereby transcending the limitations of its initial sensors and pre-programmed parameters. Consequently, its language exhibits both systematicity and productivity.",
