          "authors": "Sven Ulpts; Jesper W. Schneider",
          "abstract": "We review uses and meanings of reproducibility and replication as well as related terms in the literature across the research landscape. Based on the analysis of the review and due to the prevailing conceptual confusion surrounding the reproducibility and replication terminology, we provide a distinction between practices and epistemic functions of reproducibility and replication that allows to navigate through the conceptually confused territory and identify different types of reproducibility and replication. The practices are further distinguished between practices of enabling and redoing.",

          "abstract": "The adoption of open science principles for data has been instrumental in enabling the creation and reuse of large datasets and efficient collaboration, but requires a dedicated open data sharing infrastructure. Although clinical neuroscience research increasingly involves large-scale collaboration on controlled, sensitive data, open science principles can bring key benefits in this setting. The unique privacy and access requirements of clinical research create challenges that require a specialized data infrastructure, focused on local governance. Here we present a narrative account of a pilot project to establish such an infrastructure for the data of the ENIGMA Parkinson’s Disease working group by adopting the decentralized Nipoppy and Neurobagel tool stack. Our collaboration has led to the adoption of community data standards among international sites of the working group and has launched an open portal that enables the cross-site discovery of cohorts based on harmonized metadata. We discuss our approach to this collaboration, the social and technical challenges we have encountered and how we addressed them in the hope that groups in similar situations may benefit from our experiences.",

          "abstract": "The open science (OS) movement is growing, with increasing policies, guidelines, tools and infrastructures being developed to support researchers who engage in OS practices. However, there is no widely accepted single definition of OS. Different initiatives and countries employ a variety of characterizations. To chart how OS is understood in different parts of the world, we conducted a scoping review and critical discourse analysis of OS guidance documents aimed at researchers. Our search led to the inclusion of 69 national and international documents, with most originating from North America, Europe, and Latin America. Our results show that OS discourses are exaggerated, framing OS as the solution to address all scientific and societal problems. Furthermore, they provide often conflicting ideas about what OS can achieve. Many guidance documents frame OS as a tool to promote economic growth and efficiency. Others see OS as necessary to safeguard research quality and reproducibility through transparency. In contrast, few documents address knowledge equity and inclusion. Taking this into account, we see dominant OS discourses reproducing knowledge equity problems already present in research, rather than tackling them. We urge researchers be more precise about the specific approach they take to OS and more humble about the effects it can have – both positive, and negative.",

          "abstract": "Fiction books on aspects of research integrity can be a valuable supplement to normative guidelines on how research should be done. They provide concrete examples of violations of codes of conduct. Their narratives sketch fictional cases of research misconduct and questionable research practices, and the circumstances under which they can occur. Novels can realistically depict the dilemmas scholars need to navigate in an accessible way that readers can relate to both intellectually and emotionally. This may help them to reflect on what a good researcher is and what academic scholars can do to stay close to that ideal. A sample of 31 novels from the last 100 years is described with special attention to the research integrity themes and the drivers of the depicted problems the books contain. These novels may be used in research integrity training as a method to evoke individual reflection or to inspire group discussion.",

          "authors": "Rei Jamalifar; Sydney A. Parkinson; Arij Alarachi; Irena Milosevic; Karen Rowa",
          "abstract": "Rationale: Group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a resource-efficient treatment that increases access to psychotherapy. Yet approximately 25% of patients drop out prematurely, reducing its effectiveness and public health impact. Despite this, few studies have contacted patients post-dropout to survey their reasons for dropout. Understanding the patient perspective is critical to identify barriers and inform strategies to improve treatment retention.\n \nObjective: This study investigated reasons for dropout from group CBT for anxiety and related disorders, quantitatively contrasting individual- versus treatment-related factors and qualitatively identifying themes in patients’ own words.\n \nMethods: Adult outpatients (N = 84) who discontinued a 12-session group CBT program at a tertiary-care clinic completed the Reasons for Leaving Treatment Questionnaire (RLTQ) and provided optional qualitative feedback. A mixed-methods approach was employed: a paired-samples t test examined quantitative differences between individual-level and treatment-related factors, and qualitative responses (N = 36) underwent inductive thematic analysis.\n \nResults: On average, participants discontinued group CBT at session 5. Individual-level factors were more significantly endorsed than treatment-related factors as reasons for dropout. Qualitative analyses identified eight themes, with four major themes: (1) lack of relevance to specific issues/needs, (2) discomfort with group format and/or dynamics, (3) issues with facilitators and/or treatment organization, and (4) issues with CBT content, pace, structure, and/or length.\n \nConclusion: Findings indicate that dropout is influenced not only by individual-level factors but also by modifiable treatment-related factors, pointing to actionable dropout-prevention strategies—including personalization, cohesion-building, shorter waitlists, and re-engagement after missed sessions.",

          "authors": "Diana Jaworska; Paul C. McKee; HONGHONG TANG; Walter Sinnott-Armstrong",
          "abstract": "Fear of missing out (FoMO), a pervasive psychological phenomenon characterized by the distressing perception that others are engaging in rewarding experiences from which one is absent, is increasingly relevant in the workplace. This study investigates both general and workplace FoMO across three culturally distinct countries: Poland, China, and the United States, focusing on their relationships with job satisfaction and alternative job search. Online survey data (N = 626) revealed unexpected cross-country differences: Poland reported the highest general FoMO, while China reported the highest workplace FoMO. Moreover, general FoMO negatively predicted job satisfaction, particularly among individuals who viewed their jobs as personally undesirable. Contrary to expectations, workplace FoMO positively predicted job satisfaction, especially for those in roles perceived as less desirable, suggesting that FoMO may function as a compensatory mechanism. Furthermore, workplace FoMO positively predicted alternative job search, while general FoMO did not. A mediation analysis showed that job satisfaction indirectly buffered the link between workplace FoMO and job search behavior. These findings underscore the complex, context-dependent nature of FoMO in professional settings and offer practical implications for managing digital engagement and employee retention in increasingly connected workplaces.",

          "abstract": "We introduce a novel Bayesian Item Response Theory framework to quantify human–AI synergy, separating individual and collaborative ability while controlling for task difficulty in interactive settings. Unlike standard static benchmarks, our approach models human–AI performance as a joint process, capturing both user-specific factors and moment-to-moment fluctuations. We validate the framework by applying it to human–AI benchmark data (n=667) and find significant synergy. We demonstrate that collaboration ability is distinct from individual problem-solving ability. Users better able to infer and adapt to others’ perspectives achieve superior collaborative performance with AI–but not when working alone. Moreover, moment-to-moment fluctuations in perspective taking influence AI response quality, highlighting the role of dynamic user factors in collaboration. By introducing a principled framework to analyze data from human-AI collaboration, interactive benchmarks can better complement current single-task benchmarks and crowd-assessment methods. This work informs the design and training of language models that transcend static prompt benchmarks to achieve adaptive, socially aware collaboration with diverse and dynamic human partners.",

          "abstract": "Background. The integration of AI-based digital technologies in mental healthcare represents a transformative shift, especially with regards to chatbots, and avatar-based interventions. A central component of the success of AI-based digital mental health interventions has to do with the level of acceptance of this new technology; the degree to which stakeholders perceive a technology as useful, user-friendly, and worth adopting. We aimed to establish the level of acceptance of AI-based digital mental health interventions (AI chatbot, AI avatar-based interventions) compared to the acceptance levels of teletherapy via videoconferencing among clinicians, patients, and a representative community sample (i.e., potential future patients). We also explored the extent to which these difference towards these technologies might be explained by individuals’ attitudes towards AI in general. \nMethods. Clinicians (N= 658), patients (N= 451), and US census-based community sample (N= 520) completed standardized measures of everyday artificial intelligence use, general attitudes towards AI, and acceptability of digital technology use for mental health interventions.  \nResults. We found that community participants are most optimistic about AI-based mental health tools (chatbots and avatars), whereas clinicians consistently express more skepticism, especially regarding usability. General attitudes toward AI (both positive and negative) play a major role in shaping acceptance of chatbot and avatar-based interventions, often more than their professional role or demographic identity. \nDiscussion. These findings might carry clinical implications for the design, deployment, and integration of these technologies into mental health services.",

          "authors": "Chao Zhou; Guilherme D. Garcia",
          "abstract": "This study explores whether native Mandarin speakers, who rely on tone to infer syllable weight in their language, can use syllable weight to perceive lexical stress in European Portuguese (EP), a quantity-sensitive language where stress strongly correlates with syllable structure. Two experiments tested Mandarin speakers with no knowledge of EP on disyllabic nonce words differing in syllable weight. In Experiment 1, participants were better at identifying final stress when the final syllable was heavier. They also showed a gradient pattern: responses were most accurate for diphthongs (CVV), followed by nasal codas (CVC), and least accurate for light CV syllables. Experiment 2 confirmed the gradient effect only when orthography was present, not with auditory input alone. These results underscore the multimodal nature of L2 phonological acquisition and reveal that orthography can trigger nonnative sensitivity to phonological weight in stress perception.",

          "authors": "James Lloyd-Cox; Alan Pickering; Joydeep Bhattacharya",
          "abstract": "Creative cognition is often argued to involve a degree of inhibitory control, but it remains unclear what amount, and type, of inhibitory control is relevant to which type of creative cognition. Some evidence suggests that creative performance benefits from stronger inhibition (particularly in laboratory settings), while other evidence suggests that it benefits from weaker inhibition. Supposing that this variation in findings might be due to the multifaceted nature of both inhibitory control and creative cognition, we sought to clarify the relationship between these constructs using several measures of each, using factor analysis and regressions. We examined creative cognition using two measures of divergent thinking (the alternative uses task and a figural completion drawing task), and a measure of convergent thinking (the remote associates test). We examined inhibitory control using two measures of response inhibition (the Stroop and the Emotional Stroop), a measure of cognitive inhibition (retrieval-induced forgetting), and a measure of latent inhibition. Participants (N = 151) also completed measures of personality, intelligence, self-monitoring, and real-world creative achievement. Results revealed that cognitive inhibition was a significant predictor of divergent thinking after accounting for both trait openness and fluid intelligence, but was unrelated to convergent thinking or real-world creative achievement. Meanwhile, response inhibition and latent inhibition were not significantly related to any measure of creative cognition. These findings shed light on the nuanced relationship between inhibitory control and creative cognition, and highlight the importance of assessing these multifaceted constructs with a variety of measures.",

          "abstract": "The developmental literature testifies to young children’s remarkable communicative skills in language and gesture, but much less is known about the domain of graphical communication. In three coordinated studies with identical procedures, young children’s ability to spontaneously comprehend unfamiliar graphic symbols was tested in a simple object-choice task across a wide variety of symbol-referent relationships. In four conditions per study, reference was established via representation, part-whole relationships, analogies in size, number and form but also gestalt-like principles such as orientation, alignment or figure-ground relationships. The samples comprise German-speaking children continuously spread from the third to the seventh birthday (Study 1, N = 106; Study 2, N = 99; Study 3, N = 99). While children are generally able to use direct representations to identify the correct target item already prior to their third birthday, group-level success in all other conditions was observed later, but well before school age. Converging results from conditions employing several abstract and conceptual symbol-referent relationships point to a qualitative shift in symbolic competence around the fourth birthday. Together, this set of studies explores the conceptual continuum from iconic to abstract graphical representations and, therein, provides one of the most comprehensive, robust and systematic investigations of young children’s ability to find meaning in unfamiliar graphic symbols - a largely unexplored component of emerging literacy.",

We examined the effect of familial high risk (n=82) and history of mood disorders (recurrent: n=3, single: n=29, none: n=69) on within-person affect-behavior dynamics using Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling.\nResults\nResults showed a credible bidirectional relationship between physical activity and PA (physical activity → PA: β=0.06; 95% credibility interval [CrI], 0.02-0.09; PA → physical activity: β=.07; 95% CrI, 0.03-0.11), while NA exhibited no credible associations. Higher PA predicted decreased smartphone use (β=−.05; 95% CrI, −0.08-−0.02), while increased smartphone use was associated to subsequent elevated NA (β=.03; 95% CrI, 0.01-0.06). Familial risk status and recurrent mood disorders did not alter these bidirectional effects, but were associated with lower PA and higher NA on average (all p&lt;0.001).\nConclusions\nFindings highlight PA as a key driver in the interplay between behavior and affect.

          "abstract": "Social interactions play a central role in regulating affect and physiological arousal, with familiar and supportive relationships often associated with reduced anxiety and adaptive autonomic responses. However, it remains unclear whether individuals with depression benefit similarly from these so-called social buffering effects in everyday life. The present study examined momentary anxiety and cardiovascular responses (heart rate [HR] and heart rate variability [HRV]) during real-life social interactions in patients suffering from depression (N = 57) and matched healthy controls (N = 57). Participants reported on the familiarity and the gender of social interaction partners and the interaction context across five days, while a subsample also wore ambulatory electrocardiogram sensors. Across the patient and control group, higher interaction partner familiarity was associated with reduced state anxiety. However, only controls reported lower social interaction anxiety with increasing familiarity, indicating that the benefits of familiar social contexts only partially extends to clinical populations and that social interaction anxiety might be driven by depression-specific cognitive biases and affective patterns. State social interaction anxiety was higher in controls when they interacted with female interaction partners, while there were no differences for patients. Regarding autonomic responses, patients exhibited higher baseline and state HR and lower baseline and state HRV compared to controls, consistent with autonomic dysregulation. We also observed lower HRs in opposite-gender interactions among controls but not among patients. Overall, these findings suggest that familiar social interactions can reduce general state anxiety in both patients with depression and healthy controls, whereas social interaction anxiety and autonomic responses appear to be less strongly influenced by familiarity or the gender of interaction partners in patients. This research offers insights into how everyday social environments might support emotion regulation in clinical populations.",

          "abstract": "Emotion-recognition training is widely used as a tool to improve emotion recognition and by extension social competence, yet few studies compare unisensory and multisensory trainings. We randomly assigned adults to auditory, visual, audiovisual, or control training groups using a validated protocol adapted across modalities, and assessed emotion recognition using auditory, visual, and audiovisual tests. Responses were scored with a similarity-based metric, and change was indexed with a normalized gain difference score. Primary analyses tested training-group effects on overall and modality-specific difference scores and evaluated cross-modal generalization (improvement on untrained modalities) and trained-modality advantage (improvement on the trained modality relative to the other two). All trained groups showed reliable pre- to post-test improvement across modalities. Between-group comparisons indicated that the auditory group outperformed control on the overall measure, and the audiovisual group outperformed control on the audiovisual task. Cross-modal generalization was evident in every trained group and absent in control, indicating transfer beyond the trained modality. Trained-modality advantage was not detected, suggesting more generalized training benefits. An exploratory comparison of basic and social emotions revealed a main effect of emotion type, without differences by training condition. Taken together, the results indicate that brief training strengthens perceptual cue use and cue integration, yielding gains within and across modalities. Practically, training programs that include audiovisual components may maximize benefits while also supporting generalization beyond the trained setting.",

          "abstract": "People worldwide recognize the value of physical activity for health and are taking a more active role in promoting their own wellbeing. This study explores community-dwelling older people’s qualitative evaluation of a community-based behavioural change-based walking programme, titled ‘Step Up to Your Health’. This programme has been co-designed and co-produced between a seniors’ organisation and university partners, and this article evaluates a re-designed version of it. The programme, based on behavioural change techniques chosen by the group, incorporates the use of activity trackers, a co-designed workbook, and a weekly walking group. In the present study, 11 participants participated in semi-structured interviews on their experience. Three themes were generated through reflexive thematic analysis: ‘Physical activity promotion integrated into the community’, ‘A flexible and inclusive programme’ and ‘Psychological factors in keeping active’. This study presents an example of co-design and co-delivery of a walking programme and it informs community-based physical activity interventions. Key learnings were utilised for the design of the walking benefits app Step Up.",

          "abstract": "The mainstream scientific research of consciousness attempts to find mechanisms that make consciousness appear in a single human brain. This program has not been very successful. It seems very difficult to explain subjective consciousness relying upon neurobiological regularities. Several researchers in the past have proposed ideas of how consciousness may appear in socially interacting agents. I argue that this could be a better starting point for scientific understanding of consciousness. This approach avoids the hard problem of explaining subjective experience from underlying brain processes and analyses consciousness within a more appropriate context of behavioral and social sciences.",

          "abstract": "The present study aimed to develop and validate the Wise Emotion Regulation Ability (WERA) scale—a brief, seven-item measure designed to assess core components of effective wise emotion regulation. Drawing on the PoWER model (Ford &amp; Gross, 2019), which conceptualizes emotion regulation as a process involving situation-sensitive identification, adaptation, and management, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted on data from 152 working adults. Results supported a three-factor structure—Emotional Adaptation, Emotional Identification, and Emotional Self-Management—with excellent model fit: χ²(11) = 7.17, p = .785; CFI = 1.00; TLI = 1.06; RMSEA = 0.000; SRMR = 0.037. The three-factor model significantly outperformed a one-factor alternative (Δχ²(3) = 18.72, p &lt; .001), confirming the multidimensionality of the construct. While most standardized loadings exceeded .50, one item (WERA1) showed a weaker loading (β = .255), warranting future refinement. Internal consistency for each subscale was acceptable (ω = .54–.62), although average variance extracted (AVE) values fell below the recommended threshold, reflecting the brief nature of each factor. Discriminant validity was supported via the Fornell-Larcker criterion and HTMT analysis. The WERA scale offers a practical, low-burden tool for researchers and practitioners to assess emotion regulation in workplace and organizational contexts. Limitations include modest sample size and reliance on self-report data. Future research should explore predictive and test-retest validity in broader populations. Overall, the WERA scale demonstrates strong preliminary evidence as a reliable and theoretically grounded measure of wise emotion regulation ability.",

Our discussion covers possible theoretical and operational definitions of SL, the trade-offs between controlled laboratory tasks and ecologically valid paradigms, considerations in interpreting correlations between SL performance and other cognitive abilities, issues of measurement reliability and statistical power, and rationales for adopting individual-differences versus group-level approaches.

          "abstract": "Objective: Episodic memory naturally declines with age. The method of loci is an encoding\nstrategy that has been shown to enhance episodic memory. However, it relies heavily on\nassociative memory, as it consists in associating each item of a to-be-learnt list with a location\nalong a familiar route, and associative memory is thought to be the source of the episodic age-related decline. However, when associative memory is supported by semantic knowledge, older\nadults can compensate for this decline. This study aims to explore the use of the method of loci,\nthat we adapted to leverage pre-existing knowledge in semantic memory, to improve episodic\nmemory in aging. Methods: Word recall performance of young (18–30 years old) and older\n(60–75 years old) participants was tested after encoding word lists using the method of loci\nunder two conditions: congruent or incongruent with pre-existing knowledge, compared to a\ncontrol condition. Results: The results showed significant memory performance improvement\nin both groups when the method of loci was used with congruent associations. In contrast, in\nolder adults, performance in the incongruent condition did not improve compared with that\nobserved during encoding without a specific strategy, highlighting the importance of semantic\nlinks for associative memory. Furthermore, using the method of loci with congruent\nassociations, older adults displayed recall performance equivalent to young adults, while it was\nnot the case with incongruent associations. Conclusions: The method of loci applied in\nconditions of semantic congruence thus appears to be a promising compensatory strategy for\nolder adults.",

          "abstract": "Intensive longitudinal data collection methods like the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) are used to repeatedly assess people’s emotional states, behaviors, and context to examine their associations. Many variables of interest, such as negative affect and psychopathological symptoms, are measured with bounded scales that can produce right-skewed data. Standard linear mixed-effects models do not account for this intricacy, potentially producing biased parameter estimates.\nThis study proposes to conceptualize skewed observations as censored manifestations of underlying latent variables, using mixed-effects tobit models as an alternative analytical approach. Using data from N = 322 participants from three mental health groups (controls, depressed, psychotic) who completed mood assessments ten times daily for six days, we examined  parameter recovery capabilities of the standard linear and tobit mixed-effects models by inducing increasing skewness into an originally roughly normally distributed outcome variable (positive affect). Results indicated that the tobit model provided relatively stable parameter estimates under progressive censoring conditions, while the standard linear model showed deterioration in slope estimates approaching zero.\nWhen applied to a naturally skewed outcome variable (negative affect), the tobit model again estimated larger associations across all groups, with the greatest differences observed in controls, where floor effects were most pronounced. Tobit models also revealed greater between-person variability and reduced intercept-slope correlations.\nWhile computational complexity presents implementation challenges, these findings suggest that tobit models offer important advantages for analyzing bounded psychological constructs in ESM research. However, further research across diverse contexts is needed to establish implementation guidelines.",

          "abstract": "Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to ease the increasing workload in ophthalmology by supporting ophthalmologists’ clinical decision-making. However, despite regulatory approvals, the adoption and use of AI-enabled clinical decision support systems (AI-CDSS) in ophthalmology remains limited. Critical obstacles that innovative healthcare technologies such as AI-CDSS face on their path to widespread clinical use are nonadoption and abandonment by their intended users, which prevent broader dissemination and real clinical benefit. This study explores how to overcome nonadoption and prevent abandonment of ophthalmic AI-CDSS by identifying ophthalmology professionals’ requirements for adoption and continued use of such tools in clinical practice.\nMethods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 ophthalmology professionals from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, representing a range of professional roles, clinical settings, and extent of AI-CDSS experience. To explore sociotechnical factors shaping ophthalmology professionals’ adoption decisions and their ability to derive added value from ophthalmic AI-CDSS, we conducted a qualitative content analysis combining deductive and inductive coding. The Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-Up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework deductively guided the development of higher-level code categories, representing seven sociotechnical domains relevant for the implementation of healthcare technologies. These were further refined into subcategories through inductive coding of the interview material.\nResults: Most participants expressed general openness to ophthalmic AI-CDSS. However, actual adoption decisions and the ability to derive clinical value from these tools were shaped not just by individual attitudes but also by a range of other sociotechnical influences. Specifically, we inductively identified 29 code categories, representing sociotechnical influences and requirements from all seven NASSS domains, including technological, user, organizational, and societal aspects. Our findings also suggest that while many sociotechnical influences and challenges are shared between AI-based and traditional healthcare technologies, a key distinction of (ophthalmic) AI-CDSS lies in the users’ psychological appraisal of such tools. \nConclusions: Our findings highlight the complex and context-specific nature of integrating AI-CDSS into ophthalmic practice. This study also informs AI and healthcare researchers on the applicability of the NASSS framework for studying AI implementation and provides actionable insights for AI developers and implementers aiming to address user needs more effectively.",

          "abstract": "Individuals with high levels of Autistic traits often experience challenges in interpreting others' emotions, potentially stemming from atypical patterns of visual attention to facial cues. This study investigates whether Autism-like traits in a non-clinical sample are associated with overall emotion recognition accuracy, differential attention to facial areas of interest (eyes, mouth, and other regions), and emotion-specific recognition impairments. Eighty-two participants were presented with videos of actors displaying the six basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise) at high and low intensities while eye movements were recorded. Autism-like traits were quantified using a composite score derived from well-validated questionnaires. Overall, higher Autism-like traits correlated with weaker emotion recognition performance (r = -.34, p = .002). Attention to the mouth was positively correlated with emotion recognition accuracy (r = .24, p = .03), but not to the eyes. Notably, levels of Autistic traits did not correlate with gaze patterns to either mouth or eye regions, a null finding that differs from established literature on eye avoidance patterns in Autistic populations. Levels of Autistic traits were selectively associated with recognition of negative emotions of anger, disgust, and fear, but not happiness. These findings confirm the relationship between Autistic traits and emotion recognition difficulties in the broader population, as well as the importance of attention to emotionally salient facial features in emotion recognition. However, our hypothesis that eye-gaze patterns would mediate the relationship between autistic traits and emotion recognition difficulties was not supported.",

Based on this recommendation, we subtyped children with ADHD using autistic and ADHD traits, cognitive and psychopathological domains. Our goal was to identify distinct and meaningful subgroups within the ADHD population. We used 892 ADHD participants aged 5 to 18 from the HBN data set. Using the Latent Profile Analysis (LPA), we identified subgroups based on the following features: (1) Inattentive, Hyperactive–Impulsive subscales measured by SWAN (Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD-symptoms and Normal-behaviours), (2) cognitive flexibility, working memory, processing speed, and inhibitory control assessed with NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery, (3) autistic traits evaluated with SRS-2 (Social Responsiveness Scale-Second Edition), SCQ (Social Communication Questionnaire), and ASSQ (Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire), (4) internalizing symptoms assessed with the MFQ-P (Mood and Feelings Questionnaire) and the SCARED-P (Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders-Parent Report), (5) externalizing symptoms measured with the Rule-Breaking Behavior and Aggressive Behavior subscales of the CBCL (Child Behavior Checklist). All classes’ features showed significant results in differentiating class profiles, with externalizing symptoms showing the largest effect size and inattention, working memory, anxiety, and processing speed showed the smallest (but still significant). We found four meaningful classes: a moderately high EF/ very low symptoms profile, a high EF/ mild symptoms profile, a moderately low EF/ high symptoms profile, and an impaired EF/ low symptoms profile. We used the PSI-4 (Parenting Stress Index, Fourth Edition), SDSC (Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children), PCIAT (Parent-Child Internet Addiction Test), CGAS (Children’s Global Assessment Scale), and WIAT (Wechsler Individual Achievement Test) for external validation of the classes. The classes with the worst EF performance had lower academic achievement, and classes with more severe symptoms had greater internet addiction, parenting stress, and sleep disturbance problems. The combination of the high EF and low symptoms yielded the best outcome.",

          "abstract": "Background: Minority stress theory explores the health impacts of stress on sexual and gender minorities. Its extensions recognize that transgender, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming individuals experience unique stressors beyond those faced by cisgender non-heterosexual people, including both distal and proximal stressors affecting their well-being. Aims: This study investigates factors contributing to high rates of psychological distress in transgender, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming (TGNC) individuals, focusing on minority stressors and sources of resilience. Methods: Using a sample of 250 TGNC (transgender: 20%; nonbinary: 33%; other identities: 9%) and cisgender (38%) individuals, we assessed the effects of distal (Perceived and Anticipated Discrimination) and proximal (Internalized Transphobia) minority stressors, alongside resilience factors (Social Support and Support for Gender/Sexual Identity), on symptoms of common mental disorders (SRQ-20 scores) and internalizing symptoms (IDAS-II scores). Data were analyzed using generalized linear models with moderated mediation. Results: TGNC participants exhibited higher SRQ-20 and IDAS-II scores compared to cisgender participants. Minority stressors mediated the relationship between gender identity and SRQ-20 and IDAS-II scores. While Social Support moderated the relationship between trans identity and both Anticipated Discrimination and Internalized Transphobia, its protective effect varied across gender identities. Support for Gender/Sexual Identity mitigated the impact of Internalized Transphobia in SRQ-20 and IDAS-II scores in TGNC individuals. Conclusion: TGNC individuals face elevated psychological distress due to unique stressors. The study highlights the need for targeted interventions that promote social and identity-based support, emphasizing the role of resilience factors in improving mental health outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Ruminative brooding is a transdiagnostic symptom defined as repetitive dwelling on thoughts and emotions, and has been linked to emotion dysregulation, maladaptive metacognitive beliefs, and abnormal interoception, but the relative contributions of these factors and their neural mechanisms remain unclear. We used source-localized resting-state EEG analyses (n=31) to map these processes onto cross-frequency coupling (CFC) networks. We first identified symptoms of interest for CFC analyses by employing  regularized symptom network analyses which revealed two clusters relevant to brooding: one dominated by interoceptive/mindfulness dimensions and another by metacognitive/emotional dysregulation, with brooding aligning with the latter. We then examined links between representative symptoms from each cluster and resting-state cross-frequency phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) using partial least squares (PLS) correlation. Emotional dysregulation and brooding were associated with delta-beta PAC, whereas mindfulness symptoms related to beta-gamma and theta-gamma PAC. For the brooding/dysregulation signature, prefrontal and cingulate phase activity modulated amplitudes in regions implicated in emotion regulation and interoception (e.g., subcallosal cingulate, somatosensory cortex, insula, parietal cortex). The mindfulness/interoception signature reflected coupling within networks supporting interoceptive awareness and emotion regulation. Overall, our results indicate that brooding is more tightly linked to maladaptive metacognitive beliefs and emotional dysregulation than to mindfulness/interoception, consistent with resistance toward one’s thoughts and emotions. Neurally, this may be reflected by compensatory top-down control from prefrontal and cingulate areas over interoceptive, affective, and self-referential systems, pointing to the potential value of therapies that cultivate self-acceptance and modify maladaptive metacognitive beliefs for reducing rumination.",

          "abstract": "We see not only objects and their features (e.g., glass vases or wooden tables) but also relations between them (e.g., a vase on a table). An emerging view accounts for such relational representations by positing that visual perception is compositional: Much like language, where words combine to form phrases and sentences, many visual representations contain discrete constituents that combine systematically. This perspective raises a fundamental question: What principles guide the composition of relational representations, and how are they built over time? Here, we tested the hypothesis that the mind constructs relational representations in a canonical order. Inspired by a distinction from cognitive linguistics, we predicted that 'reference' objects (typically large, stable, and able to physically control other objects; e.g., tables) take precedence over 'figure' objects (e.g., vases) during scene composition. In Experiment 1, participants who arranged items to match linguistic descriptions (e.g., \"The vase is on the table\", \"The table is supporting the vase\") consistently placed reference objects first (e.g., table, then vase). Experiments 2–5 extended these findings to visual recognition itself: participants were faster to verify scene descriptions when reference objects appeared before figure objects in a scene, rather than vice versa. This Reference-first advantage emerged rapidly (within 100 ms), persisted in a purely visual task, and reflected abstract principles (e.g., physical forces) beyond simple differences in size or shape. Our findings reveal psychophysical principles underlying compositionality in visual processing: the mind builds representations of object relations sequentially, guided by the objects' roles in those relations.",

Generating a good plan therefore requires judicious selection of which parts of the plan space to mentally explore. Drawing on past studies of human exploration, we propose that mental exploration might invoke similar mechanisms. In particular, we test the hypothesis that mental exploration during planning is uncertainty-driven, such that people will exhibit a tendency to explore parts of the plan space that have high epistemic uncertainty. We developed a route-planning task, displayed as a binary tree, where participants were instructed to collect as many treats (rewards) as possible by traversing the tree. By separating the planning and execution phases, we encouraged participants to externalize their planning process. We manipulated uncertainty by varying the number of potential future states available from each current state. Across two studies, the data suggest that people preferred to explore options with more successor states after controlling for value differences, supporting the uncertainty-driven planning hypothesis. We also found that uncertainty played a larger role during the planning phase than during the execution phase, consistent with the hypothesis that the uncertainty effect primarily reflects a property of human planning algorithms rather than an intrinsic preference for uncertainty.",

          "abstract": "The ability to efficiently identify, respond to and regulate emotions is impaired in a large range of psychiatric disorders. Interoception, the ability to perceive, integrate and interpret internal bodily signals, contributes to emotions as it is responsible for the emergence of the subjective bodily sensations involved in affective states. Bodily maps of emotions allow visualizing where individuals feel bodily changes during discrete emotions, offering a direct window onto the interoceptive phenomenology of emotional experience. This paradigm thus also provides a direct way to observe the involvement of interoception in emotional disturbances, a transdiagnostic process of most psychiatric states. However, although the role of bodily sensations in emotional processing has been examined in certain psychiatric conditions, it has not yet been integrated into a broader transdiagnostic framework.\nFollowing PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review synthesizes research using bodily maps to assess interoceptive emotional experiences in psychiatric populations. We identified altered interoceptive experiences related to emotions and highlighted underexplored areas in this field.\nWe found altered interoceptive experiences of emotions are common across a large range of psychiatric states, including depression, schizophrenia, autism, and alcohol use disorder. Despite these broad disruptions, studies failed to establish the mechanisms by which interoceptive experiences may contribute to difficulties in different emotional processes (i.e., identification, response, and regulation). We hence propose new directions for the use of bodily maps to foster a more theoretically grounded and comprehensive analysis of interoceptive experiences in psychiatry.",

In Study 3 (United States, N = 300, pre-registered) we used an experimental vignette featuring a fictitious country to illustrate that eliciting ressentiment (as compared to a control condition) led to a significant increase in support for populism among citizens.

The purpose of this study is to develop a CIT paradigm based on the attention blink (AB) phenomenon and to verify its applicability using target detection accuracy as an index. AB refers to the failure to detect the second of two temporally proximate targets. The experimental results demonstrated that participants who had encoded crime-relevant items were more likely to miss the second target when the first target was crime-relevant than when it was irrelevant (Experiment 1). In contrast, no such difference was observed for participants who had not encoded crime-related items (Experiment 2). The result of the ROC analysis showed that the accuracy of discrimination based on AB magnitude was comparable to some of the autonomic indicators used in the current polygraph CIT. These findings provide empirical support for the feasibility of using an attentional blink-based CIT.",

          "abstract": "Cultural attractor theory proposes that recurrent psychological biases shape the persistence and transformation of cultural traditions. Portraiture offers a unique test case, embedding perceptual cues that reflect both individual choices and collective conventions. Using automated facial analysis (OpenFace), we examined over 2,000 digitized portraits from Renaissance and post-Renaissance Europe, religious artworks, and Japanese ukiyo-e. Results replicated Morin’s (2013) finding of a Renaissance shift toward direct gaze, but this trend reversed after 1600, suggesting the attractor was not stable. Religious works diverged, becoming more averted, while secular portraits engaged viewers. The left cheek bias was strong in the Renaissance, weakened in later Europe, and remained stable in ukiyo-e. Across analyses, sitter fame—but not gaze—predicted cultural visibility. Our study demonstrates how computational analyses of artworks can recover long-term dynamics of human psychology, offering “cognitive fossils” that illuminate the coevolution of visual culture and social behavior.",

          "abstract": "This study aimed to deepen our understanding of parental academic involvement by examining the quality of parental involvement, its underlying emotional processes, and its impact on children and parents themselves from an organismic perspective. Using latent profile and latent transition analyses with a two-wave sample of 1,059 U.S. parents (52% mothers) of 6th–9th graders, five parental involvement profiles were identified based on four involvement dimensions (i.e., autonomy support, psychological control, provision of structure, and warmth): Need-Supportive (~ 8%), Autonomy-Supportive Warm (~ 10%), Low Involved (~ 20%), Controlling (~ 27%), and Mixed (~ 35%). The Controlling profile showed the highest stability (82%), while the Need-Supportive profile demonstrated the highest dynamics (53%). Parental integrative emotion regulation predicted the highest probability of membership in the Need-supportive profile, whereas parental emotional dysregulation was associated with the highest likelihood of belonging to the Controlling profile. Overall, time-invariant sociodemographic factors and parental health-related problems (e.g., feeling depressed, physical pain) had minimal effects on profile probabilities. Findings regarding outcomes suggest that the Need-supportive profile is the most adaptive, contributing to a sense of self-determination in parenting, whereas the Controlling profile is the most dysfunctional, linking to the highest levels of exhaustion and need frustration in parenting. However, no differences in offspring’s school performance were found to be associated with profile membership. The study has important implications for understanding parental involvement quality and suggests ways to support parents.",

          "abstract": "Previous research on children’s emotional and behavioral reactions to reading has primarily employed a variable-centered approach, which assumes a homogeneous population with only one underlying pattern of emotional and behavioral reactions to reading. However, previous literature suggests that children can differ in their patterns of emotional and behavioral reactions to academic subjects, including reading. In this preregistered study, we aimed to identify profiles of children based on their reading-related emotions and behaviors (i.e., reading interest, reading self-efficacy, reading anxiety, and reading avoidance). By identifying these profiles, we can inform the development of interventions that target the specific emotional and behavioral traits that individual children are struggling with. Using a national sample of 1,287 U.S. twin children in 3rd through 12th grade, four profiles of reading-related emotions and behaviors were identified. About half of the children were in a profile exemplified by high positive and low negative reading-related emotions and behaviors. The other half of the children were struggling with reading-related emotions and behaviors across three distinct profiles. About 20% of the children were disengaged from reading, while another 20% of the children were primarily struggling with high reading anxiety. Finally, 7% of children presented a global distress toward reading, characterized by low reading interest and self-efficacy and very high reading anxiety and avoidance. Future directions for developing interventions that are tailored to the specific needs of children with each profile of reading-related emotions and behaviors are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Both vision and language carry rich information useful for social understanding in the real world, yet the neural processing of these signals have been mostly studied separately. Even most prior work with naturalistic stimuli does not model the contributions of vision and language signals together. Here we combined established fMRI localizer experiments, which identify social interaction perception- and language-selective regions, with a fMRI movie-viewing paradigm in the same individual participants (n=34). To pinpoint how multi-modal signals contribute to movie responses, we densely labeled the movie using vision and language deep neural networks (DNNs) and use these to predict neural responses. We found that vision model (motion and image) embeddings of movie frames predict significant activity across the cortex, while language model (speech, word, and sentence) embeddings of the spoken language predict well only in portions of the STS. We find that the individually localized motion and social interaction regions are best explained by vision model embeddings. Language regions, on the other hand, are well predicted by speech, word, and sentence language model embeddings and, surprisingly, are as equally well predicted by vision model embeddings. In an analysis of the vision model’s layer-wise and unit-wise predictivity, we find that the most predictive model units in social interaction and language regions are distinct from those in lower-level motion regions. Exploratory analyses suggest that the most predictive vision model units in social interaction and language regions contain social-semantic information conveyed by vision. Together, these results suggest that high-level visual information drives neural responses across cortex, even in language-selective regions, with varying integration of spoken language information across the STS.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Despite research on case factors that can trigger confirmation bias in investigations leading to wrongful convictions, we know little about what sparks this chain reaction and why an innocent person initially falls under suspicion. Across four studies, we investigated what perceived behaviors exhibited by 911 callers (urgency, emotionality, cognitive load, impression management, and information management) are related to laypeople’s (Studies 1-2, 4) and police officers’ (Study 3) suspicion toward the caller. Hypotheses: We predicted, for lay and police samples, callers perceived as more urgent or emotional would be perceived as less suspicious, whereas callers perceived as more under cognitive load, managing information, or managing impressions of themselves would be perceived as more suspicious. We tested whether these relationships depended on caller gender—predicting gender stereotypes might play a role, particularly with emotionality. Method: Participants (Studies 1-2, 4: online laypeople, Study 3: police officers) listened to a real 911 call (Studies 1 and 4) or a more controlled, simulated 911 call (Studies 2 and 3) by a male or female caller. We assessed behavioral predictors associated with suspicion via participants’ spontaneous impressions and scales assessing these behaviors. Participants indicated how suspicious they found the caller and how much the caller violated their expectations. Results: Participants spontaneously mentioned the callers’ emotionality most frequently and consistently across studies (77-85%). Perceptions of callers being more urgent and emotional were associated with less suspicion and violation of expectations, while perceptions of callers engaging in more information management and impression management were associated with more suspicion and violation of expectations. Police, but not laypeople, perceived male callers as more suspicious than female callers—despite holding 911 call scripts constant. Conclusion: Citizens engaging in the well-intentioned act of calling 911 risk observers—including police—holding expectations for their behavior and targeting them as a suspect if they violate those expectations.",

          "abstract": "Body posture represents an underexplored cue in social perception research, despite its potential to signal psychological states. To investigate predictions from the Embodied Emotion Theory, we examined whether body posture influences perceptions of attractiveness and self-esteem, and whether these perceptions serve as valid cues to self-reported self-esteem. First, individuals completed self-esteem measures and were photographed. Then, across three studies, observers rated photographs of these individuals (N = 108) displaying upright and slouched postures from profile and frontal viewing angles. Study 1 examined the correlations between posture angles and observer ratings using left-profile photographs. Study 2 extended this to right-profile and frontal views to distinguish posture alignment from symmetry effects. Study 3 employed a forced-choice experimental design to establish causal relationships. Results demonstrate a systematic preference for upright postures in forced-choice comparisons, with observers consistently selecting more upright over slouched postures as more attractive and indicative of higher self-esteem. However, while observers accurately judged participants’ self-esteem levels, no significant associations emerged between posture and attractiveness ratings in correlational analyses. Two unexpected findings emerged: only 13% of subjects naturally displayed upright posture, and mediation analysis revealed no relationship between posture presentation and actual self-reported self-esteem. These findings suggest that observers consistently use posture cues for social judgements and show strong preferences for upright postures. However, standard angular measurements may not capture the subtle posture information that observers naturally detect. Most subjects displayed slouched postures, yet observers consistently evaluated upright presentations more positively.",

          "abstract": "People’s first impressions, including social evaluations, are strongly influenced by the appearances of others. Body posture contributes to one’s appearance and hence may be associated with these social judgements. This study investigated whether body posture influences observers’ perceptions of trustworthiness and dominance, two principal components of body perception. The stimuli (N = 121) consist of greyscale photos depicting individuals in standardised clothing, standing naturally in left profile. Posture was objectively quantified by measuring three angles: head tilt, neck angle, and shoulder angle. Judgements from raters (N = 237) were analysed in relation to these posture metrics. A more upright posture was associated with higher perceived trustworthiness and dominance. Importantly, these effects remained significant even after accounting for sex-based anatomical differences using z-score normalisation. While sex independently contributed to the perception of trustworthiness and dominance, posture contributed uniquely and consistently to social judgements. These findings highlight posture as a key element of body perception and underscore its importance in shaping first impressions.",

          "abstract": "Psychotic symptoms are dynamic, yet traditional assessments often measure them retrospectively and at single timepoints, potentially missing clinically meaningful symptom variability. Further, many measures are population-specific, limiting their use across the psychosis continuum. To address these gaps, we developed the Momentary Assessment of Psychotic Experiences\n(MAPE), a brief self-report questionnaire measuring in-the-moment psychosis across the continuum. Validation was conducted across four community samples recruited via Prolific (N = 3,552) and one clinical sample with psychotic disorders (N = 73). The initial 56-item pool was reduced to 30 items through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses in community samples. Internal consistency was examined across samples. Convergent validity was tested against the Paranoia Scale, Magical Ideation Scale, Revised Hallucinations Scale, and Revised Social Anhedonia Scale. Concurrent validity in the clinical sample was evaluated using the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms. Analyses identified five factors: unusual thoughts/sensory experiences, paranoia, amotivation/anhedonia, social anhedonia, and negative affect. This structure showed excellent fit and internal consistency in community samples, with comparable reliability in the clinical sample. MAPE subscales demonstrated moderate correlations with subclinical psychosis measures in community samples and interviewer-rated symptoms in the clinical sample. Findings support the MAPE as a valid and standardized measure of momentary psychotic experiences. By focusing on current state, the MAPE reduces retrospective bias and improves ecological validity. Designed for use across both subclinical and clinical populations, the MAPE also offers a unique tool for studying psychotic symptoms along the continuum.",

          "abstract": "The folded-X pattern has been identified as a critical signature of confidence, wherein easier conditions lead to confidence increases for correct trials but confidence decreases for error trials. However, recent work has identified violations of the folded-X pattern where easier conditions lead to increased confidence for both correct and error trials (double-increase pattern). Nevertheless, it remains an open question what stimulus manipulations lead to the folded-X vs. double-increase patterns. Here we test the hypothesis that the double-increase pattern emerges for manipulations of the quality of the sensory input (stimulus reliability), whereas the folded-X pattern emerges for manipulations of the distance between the sensory feature of interest and the decision boundary (boundary distance). Across two experiments (N = 78) using orientation judgment with either Gabor patches or moving dots, we first replicate previous findings that boundary distance manipulations have a stronger effect on accuracy whereas stimulus reliability manipulations have a stronger effect on confidence. Critically, we find that boundary distance manipulations produce the standard folded-X pattern, while the stimulus reliability manipulations result in the double-increase pattern. We further show that reaction time (RT) patterns largely mirror confidence patterns, though with some notable exceptions, highlighting both the utility and limitations of using RT as a proxy for confidence. These results demonstrate that different stimulus manipulations have dissociable effects on the signatures of confidence and could allow researchers to predict a priori whether a new manipulation would lead to the folded-X or the double-increase pattern.",

          "abstract": "The rising prevalence of mental health problems among adolescents has prompted increased scrutiny of social media as a contributing factor. Previous research has produced mixed results, likely due to the varying impact of social media on different dimensions of mental health. To advance understanding in this area, this study examined how social media use affects three critical dimensions of adolescent mental health – well-being, self-esteem, and friendship closeness. Specifically, we examined whether adolescents experienced consistent (unity) or contrasting (duality) effects across these dimensions by analyzing 44,211 daily diaries from 479 adolescents over 100 days. We found that the majority of adolescents (60%) experienced unity in negative effects of social media, suggesting that social media use is a notable contributor to mental health issues. Moreover, 13.6% of adolescents experienced duality in effects, indicating that social media use simultaneously harms and benefits different dimensions of their mental health. Exploratory analyses demonstrated the importance of examining platform-specific effects, revealing negative impacts of TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram use and positive or null effects of Snapchat and WhatsApp use on the three dimensions of mental health. Our findings highlight the need for tailored strategies that account for the varying impacts of social media on adolescent mental health.",

          "authors": "Camila Valenzuela-Moguillansky",
          "abstract": "This article proposes a contemplative research framework—the Multidimensional Approach to Presence (MAP)—for the scientific study of lived experience. Building on micro-phenomenological research, the proposal examines how cultivating presence –inhabiting one’s lived experience as it unfolds– can be integrated methodologically and epistemologically into experiential inquiry. Drawing on studies of pain and bodily awareness, it analyzes three moments in the generation of experiential knowledge: contact with experience, the description of experience, and the analysis of descriptions. From an enactive perspective that conceives experience as dynamic, self-referential, and transformative, the discussion addresses the strengths and limitations of the method, particularly regarding evocation and memory, dimensions of lived experience that exceed declarative language, and the intersubjective character of knowledge generation. MAP places the cultivation of presence at the core of the investigative process and operates on two levels: methodologically, by integrating tools that foster familiarity with bodily experience—such as micro-phenomenological interviewing, somatic practices, and artistic expression—and epistemologically, by contending that investigating experience requires transforming modes of knowing and thereby opening a process of self-transformation. In this way, the article highlights the need to broaden the methodological and epistemological repertoire of cognitive science, paving the way for a science of experience consistent with the very nature of what it seeks to investigate.",

We developed and validated the Goals for Honesty and Goals for Dishonesty (GHGD) questionnaire - the first comprehensive instrument measuring honesty-humility through its motivational core. Using a multi-method, bottom-up approach across three studies, we systematically identified and classified personal goals associated with honesty-humility traits. Study 1 employed participant-driven goal elicitation using personality-descriptive adjectives. Responses were classified using natural language processing and independent raters' coding, yielding a final set of goals. Study 2 refined candidate goals, selecting those specifically associated with honesty-humility and its facets, and developed the GHGD questionnaire. Study 3 provided comprehensive validation using self-reports, informant-reports, and observed behavior in an incentivized cheating task. Results revealed a robust two-factor structure distinguishing honesty-oriented goals (GH) from dishonesty-oriented goals (GD). These dimensions were moderately negatively correlated, indicating distinct rather than bipolar motivational orientations. GD consistently predicted actual dishonest behavior beyond traditional trait measures, while GH related more strongly to authentic living and self-concept integrity. Agreement between self- and informant-reports suggested that close others can form quite accurate impressions of individuals' honesty-related motivations. Findings demonstrate that goal-based assessments can improve prediction of honest behavior compared to conventional trait self-reports. This work integrates trait-based and process-oriented approaches to personality, delivering theoretical contributions and empirical instruments that will facilitate future research on moral personality and behavior.",

          "abstract": "Episodic memory is a declarative long-term memory of a specific past experience. As such, it is multifaceted, encompassing both the objective and subjective components of that experience. These components can be flexibly represented at different levels of granularity, from precise, context-specific details to generalized, gist-like representations. In this review, we suggest that 1) multiple representations of an episodic memory at different levels of granularity are simultaneously encoded into a memory trace and 2) the relative weighting of these representations determines the extent to which a memory is reconstructed or reproduced at retrieval. We propose that this representational flexibility drives adaptive behavior by prioritizing reconstruction or reproduction depending on the age of the memory, its relationship to prior knowledge, current attentional goals, or task demands, and individual differences. Drawing on research in humans and non-human animals, we show a close correspondence between psychological and neural representations of a memory across encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. Specifically, we discuss how hippocampal activity in humans and engram formation and activation in rodents support the reproduction of detailed memory representations, while schema formation across species, mediated by the medial prefrontal cortex, facilitates reconstruction and generalization to guide behavior. Finally, we consider how species- and individual-level differences shape episodic memory representations. By integrating findings across species, we illustrate how the correspondence between neural and psychological representations enables multiple memory representations to balance stability and flexibility, ultimately driving adaptive behavior.",

          "abstract": "A person’s gaze can be highly informative—it can reveal which people, objects, or places interest the person, and it can help observers predict what they might do next. It can also be difficult to understand. Relative to actions for which someone physically contacts a target (e.g., by reaching and touching), gaze may be difficult to understand because of the physical distance between the action and target. Indeed, classic research suggests that before 12 months of age, infants do not readily track the targets of others’ gaze. However, studies on the development of gaze understanding have mostly presented infants with unfamiliar adults acting on inanimate objects. Here, we provide evidence that 8- to 9-month-old infants can track the targets of their parents' gaze when that gaze was directed at a potential social partner: an animate puppet. When infants observed their own parents look toward an animate puppet, they expected them to continue looking towards the same puppet later. Infants did not have the same expectations when their parents looked toward inanimate objects, nor when they observed the gaze of an unfamiliar adult. Thus, before infants track the targets of object-directed gaze, they already track the targets of their parents’ social gaze. These findings are consistent with the possibility that social relevance shapes infants’ understanding of others’ actions.",

Families in rural communities experience more overweight/obesity and unique barriers with food access.

This study compares prevalence of food insecurity in a treatment-seeking sample to state and national population averages and tests food insecurity’s influence on parent/child mental health, child dietary intake, and parent/child body mass. \nMethods: Parent/child dyads in rural Kansas (n = 148) recruited based on child weight status (i.e., above 85th percentile) completed measures of household food insecurity, eligibility for free and reduced-price lunch, mental health, and child dietary intake, as well as standardized height/weight at baseline for a family-based healthy lifestyles intervention study. \nFindings: Results indicate the rate of food insecurity (25%) and child healthy eating index scores (M = 51.01, SD = 8.40) were significantly elevated compared to population metrics (ps &lt; .001); however, eligibility for free and reduced price lunch in this sample (50%) was similar to national and state averages. Families with food insecurity, compared to those in the study who were food secure, exhibited significant differences (ps &lt; .05) regarding: poorer parent mental health, higher parent BMI, and increased sugar-sweetened beverage intake for children. \nConclusion: Findings highlight the need to assess and address food insecurity in family-focused obesity interventions, especially among families living in rural areas.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive stability and flexibility are often conceived as two antagonistic modes of cognitive control. While stability supports the maintenance of a stable task focus and resistance against interference, cognitive flexibility facilitates adaptive responses to changing demands. In a pre-registered electroencephalography study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying adjustments in cognitive stability and flexibility by examining neural signatures of cognitive control adjustments. Specifically, we tested whether deliberate enhancements in cognitive stability and flexibility levels were associated with a facilitation of goal shielding and shifting, respectively. Participants completed a task-switching experiment in which they received explicit strategy instructions that aimed at promoting either cognitive stability or flexibility in a within-subjects design. We assessed mid-frontal theta power as an indicator of cognitive control recruitment and effort mobilization. Participants succeeded in adopting the instructed control states and behaviorally exhibited inverse adjustments in indicators of cognitive stability and flexibility. However, we did not find any differences in theta power in response to shielding or shifting demands between conditions. Consistent with previous studies and subjective effort ratings, more stable control states were further not associated with a generally increased recruitment of cognitive control. We thus did not find that adjustments in cognitive stability and flexibility were linked to modulations in effort or cognitive control recruitment. Potential processes that may have promoted more effective task shielding and shifting are discussed, providing directions for future research.",

          "abstract": "Disruptions in interoception, the awareness of internal bodily signals, are strongly linked to various psychological and physiological conditions, including eating disorders (EDs) such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder. Despite growing evidence that altered interoceptive processing is central to EDs, the use of interoceptive-based interventions (IBIs) in this population remains under-explored. This systematic review aims to evaluate the application and efficacy of IBIs in the treatment of eating disorders.\nA comprehensive search of PsycINFO, Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus was conducted, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. We included randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, case series, and single-case studies involving individuals with ED diagnoses and interventions incorporating interoceptive elements (e.g., mindfulness, biofeedback, interoceptive exposure). The primary outcomes evaluated were ED-related clinical measures and psychological variables such as anxiety and stress.\nEleven studies, totaling 404 participants, were included in the review. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) were the most common and consistently led to improvements in emotional regulation, reduced binge/compensatory behaviors, and enhanced bodily awareness. While promising, preliminary findings from studies on interoceptive exposure and biofeedback indicated a potential for reducing avoidance and anxiety, particularly in patients with anorexia nervosa and binge-eating disorder. A key limitation across most studies was a high risk of bias and a lack of standardized measures for assessing interoceptive outcomes.\nThis review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the current literature on IBIs for eating disorders, enhancing our understanding of their clinical application and highlighting critical areas for future research and refinement.",

          "abstract": "Art engagement is increasingly recognized as a supportive intervention in behavioral health settings, with evidence linking art exposure and participation to improvements in emotion regulation, stress reduction, therapeutic engagement, and clinical outcomes. Yet there is limited research on how art engagement is implemented and perceived in behavioral health settings, including across levels – passive, active, and interactive art exposure, and art-making. This study first conducted a literature review in neuroscience, psychology, and environmental design, to identify mechanisms by which art engagement may influence brain function, health and wellbeing, and clinical outcomes. To extend this research, two surveys were conducted across 40 behavioral health institutions in the United States to evaluate staff’s perceptions of art’s impact on themselves and their patients. Respondents reported positive impacts of art interventions on mood, stress, patient engagement in therapy, and staff morale, while also identifying barriers such as funding, leadership support, and arts training. Arts programming was more commonly offered to patients than staff, despite high staff interest, yet institutions offering programming to both groups reported better outcomes across nearly every measured domain. Drawing from the literature and survey data, a framework is proposed for integrating art into behavioral health settings at environmental, programmatic, and organizational levels: the CARE framework – Curated environment, Active programming, Recovery tools, Equitable access. Together, these findings position art engagement as an evidence-informed strategy to enhance patient care and staff wellbeing and highlight the need for standardized approaches to implementation and evaluation.",

          "abstract": "Social exclusion has been linked to increased risk for psychotic experiences; however, it remains unclear whether exclusion has a unique impact beyond general negative experiences. Across two studies run between April 2024 and May 2024, we tested whether recalling autobiographical experiences of exclusion leads to greater increases in psychotic experiences compared to recalling other negatively valenced experiences (i.e., sadness) using a within-subjects design and a novel momentary self-report measure. Participants completed the Momentary Assessment of Psychotic Experiences (MAPE) immediately before and after a five-minute recall task, during which they were randomly assigned to recall an experience of exclusion, sadness, inclusion, or a neutral event. Study 1 (N = 810) found that neither the exclusion nor sadness induction increased positive symptoms. Both conditions led to increased negative symptoms but did not differ significantly from each other. Study 2 (N = 836) replicated these findings in an independent sample. Across both studies, inclusion unexpectedly led to a reduction in negative symptoms, including amotivation and anhedonia, and social anhedonia. These findings suggest that exclusion contributes to short-term increases in psychotic experiences that reflect negative symptoms, but its effects are not distinguishable from other negatively valenced life experiences. In contrast, inclusion may have a protective effect, reducing specific negative symptoms. Together, these findings highlight the need to consider both negative and positive life experiences when evaluating social risk and protective factors for psychotic experiences.",

Despite decades of calls for their abolishment and more strength-based understandings of neurodiversity, no compelling alternatives yet exist. In this article, we illustrate and differentiate behaviour currently associated with attention disorder labels of ADHD and CDS. Extending our existing spacetime attention framework within process-based therapy theory we model ADHD and CDS-related traits as lower attention retention and selection over multiple tasks and goals. With the assumption spacetime attention fluctuations dictate the direction and duration of relational development, we provide a more nuanced understanding of how attention changes may affect functional, meaningful outcomes across different contexts and success criteria. As examples, attention moving away from uncomfortable internal experiences (thoughts, feelings, and emotions) may prevent suppression and regain mindful, present moment attention; attention moving internally may help creativity and encourage more meaningful actions. We then provide practical recommendations for assessment and holistic support for clients struggling with inattention within acceptance-based psychology practice.",

Across three studies (N = 220) using an Object Copying Task, we show that some participants consistently exhibited greater WM usage than others. These tendencies were reliable, stable across time, and predicted individuals’ task efficiency and responses to changing task demands. Finally, spontaneous WM usage could only partially be explained by established measures of WM capacity and attentional control – two plausible predictors of natural WM usage. In summary, we find stable tendencies in individuals’ spontaneous WM usage, despite the variable nature of self-structured natural behaviour. Our results position inter-individual variability as an important dimension in understanding natural, memory-guided behaviour, highlighting the need to investigate its broader determinants and behavioural consequences.",

          "abstract": "There is now robust evidence that individuals can direct their attention towards particularly valuable information in working memory. However, the cognitive mechanisms underlying such effects are still under debate. One possibility is that participants preferentially encode high value information, creating a stronger representation relative to other information presented. We tested this hypothesis in two experiments. Participants completed a visual working memory task, which involved remembering the color of shapes for a brief period of time. During the encoding phase participants’ eye movements were recorded to assess fixation behaviors. Participants were then presented with one shape and asked to report the color as accurately as possible on a color wheel. In Experiment 1, participants were either told that one particular item was more valuable (i.e., worth more notional points than the rest), or that all items were of equal value. In Experiment 2, each item differed in its value in a graded manner (i.e., 1-2-3-4 points). Across both experiments, participants exhibited the lowest recall error for the highest value information. Moreover, participants spent significantly longer fixating on high value items during the encoding phase relative to other information presented. Further, the extent to which participants fixated on an item during encoding partially mediated the effect of value on recall error. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that participants vary their eye movements during encoding as a function of value, and suggest that value-driven prioritization effects in working memory are partially driven by such behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Children who have returned from the Caliphate, living under the ISIS-regime, and from Kurdish camps have faced harsh living conditions, including war and separation from their parents. Such experiences are risk factors for the development of affect, cognition, behaviour, attachment, and social-emotional competencies. However, there is still limited knowledge about the development of this specific group of children, since previous studies were solely based on adult perspectives. \nThe participants of the current study were 22 Dutch children, who returned to the Netherlands between September 2018 and November 2022. Data were also gathered from their parents, caregivers, and teachers. Assessment took place in the first nine months after return. \nAdditionally, the current study is the first study on child returnees with a mixed-methods design. Standardised, normed instruments (‘quantitative’) and interviews (‘qualitative’) were employed to assess the children’s experiences in Syria and/or Iraq, their affect, cognition, behaviour, attachment and social-emotional competencies upon return and their living conditions following their return to the Netherlands. \nThe results confirm that the children experienced harsh physical and emotional living conditions in Syria/Iraq, and indicate affective problems, delays in cognitive development, problematic attachment and adaptation problems. However, positive outcomes were also identified, including the children's strong social-emotional skills in recognizing and empathizing with other people’s emotions.\nIn conclusion, the affective and cognitive development of children who have returned appear to be most threatened by their experiences, although causality cannot be demonstrated. The findings imply the needs for careful assessment of each individual, treatment of trauma and deviant affective development, as well as availability of attachment figures. Monitoring children over a longer period is however crucial to identifying possible resilience and long-term consequences. Although the mixed-methods multi-informant approach proved crucial for balanced conclusions, differences between informants and measures also make it difficult to reach definitive conclusions. \n\nKEYWORDS: Child Returnees – Caliphate – Psychological Trauma – Traumatic Stress – War Violence – Terrorism – Development – Reintegration",

          "authors": "Shane McLoughlin",
          "abstract": "Character education research is often constrained by blunt methodological tools. Surveys capture breadth without depth; case studies offer richness but lack replicability; and randomised controlled trials (RCTs), though indispensable at the policy level, are costly, disruptive, and ill-suited to everyday practice. More troublingly, they rest on an ergodic fallacy: assuming that what works on average must work for each individual. In reality, interventions that deliver modest positive effect sizes typically conceal a mix of no effects, negative effects, and only some benefits. This leaves teachers, mentors, and coaches without rigorous tools to evaluate what matters most: whether an intervention works here, now, for this pupil. This paper argues that single-subject designs (SSDs) offer a neglected but transformative solution. SSDs involve repeated measurement in which individuals serve as their own controls, allowing strong causal inference through replication while remaining sensitive to idiosyncratic development. They democratise research by enabling practitioners to capture and publish the wisdom of context-sensitive practice without the machinery of large trials. Through worked examples drawn from moral and character education, this tutorial demonstrates how to design, measure, analyse, and report SSDs to rigorous standards. SSDs can reshape the field into a cumulative, idionomic science that empowers practitioners and complements large-scale studies.",

          "abstract": "Collocations, frequently co-occurring words, are fundamental to language use, yet it remains unclear whether they are processed holistically or sequentially through their constituents over the timecourse of comprehension. Therefore, using eye-tracking, we investigated how frequency and family size (i.e., the number of collocations sharing a constituent; fatal  fatal accident/error/inquiry/disease) influence collocation processing in L1 and L2 speakers. We observed that higher-frequency constituents were read faster than low-frequency constituents in earlier eye-tracking measures, while high-frequency collocations received fewer fixations than low-frequency collocations in later eye-tracking measures. Additionally, high family sizes facilitated processing frequent collocations in L1 speakers, whereas the opposite pattern was observed in L2 speakers. These findings demonstrate that L1 and L2 speakers are sensitive to frequency at both the word and phrase level. However, L2 speakers’ greater reliance on constituent-level cues suggests weaker holistic representations. The study supports the usage-based and statistical learning models.",

While much research has focussed on its capacity limitations, less is known about how vSTM operates in dynamic environments where priorities shift across feature dimensions. In this study, we bridge research on vSTM and cognitive control by embedding change detection (Experiments 1 and 2) and delayed estimation (Experiment 3) paradigms within a task switching paradigm, where the relevant feature dimension (colour or orientation) either repeated or switched across trials. Across all experiments we observed a cost to vSTM performance on switch relative to repetition trials. Mixture modelling of delayed estimation responses revealed that these switch costs were not due to reduced memory precision or memory failures, but rather to a selective increase in non-target responses reflecting feature--location binding errors. We propose that dimension switching selectively impairs the binding of feature values to locations and allows interference from irrelevant (but recently attended) feature dimensions. Our findings demonstrate that vSTM is sensitive to failures of attentional control, not just capacity limits.",

          "abstract": "Research has shown a processing advantage for multiword sequences (MWS) in both first language (L1) and second language (L2) speakers over novel word combinations. However, whether this advantage holds for different types of MWS for both groups is not known. We used a self- paced reading paradigm combined with a stop-making-sense task to investigate the processing of idioms used figuratively (e.g., “grey area”), idioms used literally, collocations (e.g., “vast area”), and novel combinations (e.g., “rare area”), in both L1 and L2 speakers. In line with previous findings, both L1 and L2 speakers read collocations faster than novel word combinations. Only L1 speakers showed a processing advantage for idioms used figuratively over collocations after controlling for distributional factors (e.g., phrase-level frequency, familiarity and contextual predictability), suggesting that semantic conventionality facilitates direct retrieval of idiomatic meanings. L2 speakers with lower proficiency did not show an advantage for idioms used figuratively but exhibited faster reading for idioms used literally over idioms used figuratively. While the meaning dominance of idioms did not exert an effect, greater idiom decomposability facilitated processing. Together, these findings indicate that, while frequency effects broadly support MWS processing, L2 speakers rely on compositional analysis in idiom comprehension more than L1 speakers.",

          "abstract": "A central goal of perceptual decision making is to determine the computations underlying choice and confidence in complex, multi-alternative tasks. However, revealing these computations requires knowledge of the internal evidence representation upon which the computations operate. Unfortunately, unlike for 2-choice tasks, there is no established method in multi-choice tasks to determine how stimuli are transformed into internal evidence. Here we address this critical gap by developing a novel modeling paradigm that reveals how the brain transforms external stimuli into internal evidence representations during multi-alternative decision making. Across three experiments that feature 3- and 5-choice conditions, we show that the internal evidence representation for these stimuli can be described with a simple, two-parameter equation that fits data for up to 12 conditions. Critically, the ability to model the internal evidence representations allowed us to test six theories of confidence computation. Our results support a new model where confidence reflects the raw evidence difference between the top two alternatives. These results establish a new paradigm in which a two-parameter equation can be used to determine the internal evidence representation for potentially unlimited number of multi-alternative conditions and put forward a new model of confidence computation in multi-alternative tasks.",

          "abstract": "The visual system can quickly extract statistical properties of multiple objects (ensembles). Observers can explicitly access and report the distribution of low-level features, such as color. Here, we investigate whether explicit access extends to the distributions of high-level features, e.g., emotional expressions of a group of faces. In Experiment 1, we presented observers with ensembles that have a Gaussian, uniform or bimodal distribution of emotional expressions (or colors as a low-level baseline condition). The task was to report the frequency of a randomly chosen feature value. Observers’ responses closely followed the underlying distribution for colors but were much noisier for the emotional expressions.  Observers could distinguish all the three color distributions while they could discern only the most contrasting distributions of emotional expressions (Gaussian and bimodal). Additionally, modelling showed that observers’ performance in both conditions was based on the integration of global information rather than the subsampling of a few objects. Experiment 2 showed that disrupting holistic face processing via face inversion manipulation does not change the observer’s performance for ensembles of emotional expressions. It indicates that the visual system cannot form a high-level feature distributional representation per se. Instead, it relies on low-level correlates (e.g., mouth curvature, brows’ tilt, etc.) to build a distributional representation of multiple facial expressions. Our findings help to explain how people can quickly obtain emotional information from many faces in a crowd and have a rich perceptual experience despite severe capacity limitations of visual attention and working memory.",

We examined the association of MEAL scores with happiness, frustration and boredom during the frustration-inducing mood drift task, in which participants wait for six minutes and rate their mood every 30 seconds.\nResults\nThe MEAL showed good psychometric properties, capturing three factors for hunger-related ‘irritability’, ‘low mood’ and ‘somatic feelings’ (RMSEA = 0.03 in community adults, 0.05 in community adolescents, 0.08 in adults with mental health disorder history). Quantitative and qualitative responses evidenced that hunger-related mood dysregulation impacts relationships, work and other activities. MEAL scores were associated with irritability, depression, anxiety and menstrual symptoms.

          "abstract": "From 2010 to 2014, a series of events and publications revealed that much of the psychological literature was less robust than the field believed. Researchers have highlighted various issues underlying fragile findings in large swaths of psychological science. In response, the field has also proposed solutions to help build a more robust literature. Foremost among these solutions are a suite of Open Science practices, including preregistration, Registered Reports, and the posting of materials, data, and analytic scripts. While these solutions have primarily emerged outside of clinical science, there is some evidence that clinical science is beginning to adopt Open Science practices. The present study focuses on the use of Open Science practices in personality disorder research, specifically. We discuss the relevance of these practices to personality disorder research, and examine rates of Open Science practices in articles published between 2021-2023 in two personality disorder journals, Journal of Personality Disorders (Article N=150) and Personality Disorders: Theory, Research, and Treatment (Article N=158). The rate of Open Science practices in these articles was compared to empirical articles from a select number of general personality journals published during the same time period (Article N range=125-247). Overall, the personality disorder articles showed lower rates of Open Science practices compared to the general personality articles, while some practices (Registered Reports) were consistently low across all articles. In light of these findings, we discuss ways that personality disorder researchers can effectively implement Open Science practices to help facilitate a more transparent research literature.",

          "authors": "Nathan Pond; Frances Meeten; Patrick Clarke; Lies Notebaert; Ryan Bradley Scott",
          "abstract": "Generalised anxiety disorder is a prevalent condition linked to the presence of cognitive biases, including attention bias. Attention bias is the tendency to attend preferentially to threat-related stimuli and has been consistently observed in high anxious samples. Interventions to modify these biases have been developed with the aim of alleviating anxiety symptoms. However, while initial studies were promising, the current evidence-base for attention bias modification (ABM) procedures to alleviate symptoms is mixed. Furthermore, concerns have been raised regarding the potential for demand effects to be underlying previous significant findings. We revisited the efficacy of ABM, conducting a replication of a seminal study showing successful alleviation of anxiety symptoms following multi-session ABM training (Hazen et al., 2009). As a secondary aim, we quantified the potential influence of demand effects in the paradigm. Participants (N = 104) classed as high worriers attended seven lab-based sessions. This included five probe-based ABM training sessions (or sham-training control), and a pre- and post-training session in which levels of attention bias, worry, trait anxiety and depression were assessed. We adopted a Bayesian approach to analyses with a series of Bayesian t-tests evaluating the change in each outcome measure from pre- to post-training. These analyses revealed sensitive evidence for the null hypothesis of no effect for all measures except the measure of depression (which was insensitive), and no sensitive evidence for demand effects. These findings join a growing body of literature suggesting that probe-based ABM training does not lead to a robust reduction in bias or anxiety. Therefore, alternative ABM paradigms should be investigated.",

          "abstract": "What are the evolutionary functions of imaginative-narrative simulation as evident in fiction and other expressions of imagination, and how do they influence psychological wellbeing? We propose an integrative and multifunctional framework for understanding imaginative-narrative simulation—the mental, imaginative simulation of events, sourced from memory and fiction, and structured through narrative—as a key adaptive capacity. Drawing from evolutionary psychology, cognitive science, and media studies, we identify four core functions of this capacity: functions that support (i) planning and future thought, (ii) coping and emotion regulation, (iii) bonding and social needs, and (iv) identity and worldviews. We argue that these functions can importantly support psychological wellbeing, and we review a range of empirical studies that have investigated imagination, fiction, and psychological wellbeing during the lockdown restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic that speak to these effects. We suggest that despite its potential, there is a significant gap in the literature on the adaptive value of imagination and fiction, especially in the context of global crises, and offer concrete directions for future empirical work.",

          "abstract": "Digital games can shape everyday cognition, yet the roles of player skill, videogame genre, and play frequency across adulthood remain unclear. We studied 507 adult gamers of 3 age-groups (18–35, 36–55, 56+ years) to test how gaming skill and frequency relate to everyday memory and executive functioning. Participants completed the Gaming Skills Questionnaire (GSQ) and measures of everyday cognition: the Executive Skills Questionnaire–Revised, Everyday Memory Questionnaire–Revised, and Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the GSQ’s validity and reliability. Mixed-effects models estimated main and interaction effects of skill, frequency, age, and videogame genre. Higher skill was linked to fewer difficulties—especially for strategy and role-playing games—with advantages in planning, emotion regulation, and prospective/retrospective memory. In contrast, higher frequency was linked to more difficulties, particularly among younger adults. Puzzle play showed mixed associations: better organisation/time management but greater behavioural-regulation challenges. Age moderated several effects, with benefits attenuating from young to middle-aged and older groups. Findings specify conditions for genre-specific links with everyday memory and executive control: skill appears beneficial, whereas excessive frequency may undermine control processes. The GSQ offers a genre-sensitive measure for profiling gaming skill and frequency and can support research and practice on everyday memory across the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is assumed to have had a large impact on the mental health of adolescents. Finding out for which youth the mental health impact was largest is imperative for strengthening future crisis responses. In this study, we aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of different sociodemographic groups of general population adolescents in Flanders, Belgium. Methods: Adolescents were tested for the SIGMA study, at W1 (n=1913; mean age=13.8; 63.1% female; 2018/2019); W2 (n=272; mean age=16.5; 74.0% female; 2020); and W3 (n=227; mean age=18.0; 78.4% female; 2022/2023). Subclinical anxiety, depression, psychoticism, and general psychopathology were measured with the Brief Symptom Inventory-53. Multilevel linear regression models with imputed data sets were used to test cross-wave differences in each psychopathology outcome (controlling for age-related increases), effects of time since the beginning of the pandemic and stringency of pandemic-related measures, and effects of several sociodemographic predictors on levels and changes in psychopathology (from W1 to W2, and from W1 to W3). Results: Results indicated limited overall early increases in psychopathology (only for depression from W1 to W2), and some decreases in psychopathology levels from W1 to W3 (for anxiety and general psychopathology). Girls and those reporting same-gender attraction reported higher levels of nearly all symptoms. Conclusion: Although most youth in this sample were resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic, some groups consistently showed high psychopathology levels. Attention is still needed for groups that were at risk before the pandemic, notably, LGTBQIA+ youth.",

          "abstract": "Learning to predict threat based on environmental cues, and to adapt behaviour accordingly, is critical to human survival. This type of learning is governed by distinct systems in the brain. Model-free learning is reflexive and computationally efficient, allowing for rapid responses based on past experience. In contrast, model-based learning is more flexible and relies on an internal model of the environment, which can be updated without direct experience. To enhance the translational value of human fear-conditioning research and facilitate the interpretation of fear-reduction interventions, it is essential to determine what type of learning underlies commonly used measures of conditioned responding. To address this question, we evaluated whether fear potentiated startle (FPS) and skin conductance responses (SCRs) reflected model-free and/or model-based learning in three fear-conditioning experiments (total n = 132). All experiments included a phase in which the value of the US was decreased through instructions, or through removal of the US electrode (US devaluation), enabling us to distinguish between model-based and model-free learning processes. In the first two experiments, FPS responses remained elevated after US devaluation, reflecting model-free learning, while SCRs updated instantly, indicating model-based control. In the third experiment, both measures followed a model-based pattern. We speculate that these differences between experiments are due to decreased uncertainty and overall less differential conditioning (FPS) in the third experiment. In sum, while SCRs seem best explained by a model-based account of learning, FPS responses appear able to index both model-free and model-based learning, with the balance between these two systems potentially depending on the level of uncertainty in the environment.",

          "abstract": "Childhood maltreatment significantly impacts future mental health, but the mechanisms linking maltreatment and psychopathology remain unclear. Neurocognitive adaptations following maltreatment may constitute a latent vulnerability for mental health problems. While previous research shows that maltreatment alters threat and reward processing, its effects on learning and decision-making are poorly understood. We investigated how childhood maltreatment influences future learning and decision-making motivated by win-seeking vs. loss-avoidance in volatile environments. Adolescents aged 12-17 with (n=59) and without (n=46) maltreatment exposure completed a probabilistic reversal learning task with separate win-seeking and loss-avoidance conditions during fMRI. We employed computational modelling to assess latent learning processes. We explored effects of the extent of maltreatment and psychiatric symptoms. A belief-based Hidden Markov model showed that maltreatment-exposed individuals expected less stable reward contingencies in in the win-seeking condition than controls. Congruently, maltreated adolescents perseverated less and thus outperformed controls after reversals in the win-seeking condition. At the neural level, maltreated adolescents displayed lower right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation associated with environmental changes (upcoming reversals). In maltreated adolescents, lower estimates of stability in the win condition were associated with more psychiatric symptoms and impaired performance during stable task phases. Together, our results show that childhood maltreatment may lead to neurocognitive alterations that enhance flexibility in win-seeking contexts, consistent with an adaptive calibration account of maltreatment. These alterations, if excessive, lead to maladaptive decision-making in stable environments and may also contribute to the development of psychiatric symptoms.",

Care workers provided information on adolescents’ demographics (i.e., age, gender, and nationality) and care history variables (i.e., age at entry into care, number of out-of-home placements). Adolescents self-reported their internalizing and externalizing problems, perception of the group climate, and school engagement.\nResults: After accounting for the hierarchical structure of the data (i.e., adolescents nested within residential facilities, the results showed that higher levels of internalizing and externalizing problems and having experience multiple out-of-home placements, were associated with lower levels of school engagement.

We show that behavioural traits explain more variation in protected area coverage than economic indicators alone. Furthermore, trust is negatively associated with protected area coverage at the country level, suggesting that high-trust societies rely more on informal conservation practices. These findings challenge conventional models focused on economic and governance drivers and highlight the need for policies that align with population behaviours.

Using primary data from 12 studies (N = 40 interaction effects), we analyzed how age, gender, and education moderate the effectiveness of defaults compared to active choice conditions. Results show no consistent and rarely any interaction effects, suggesting defaults influence food decisions similarly across socio-demographic groups.

          "abstract": "The integration of social robots into educational contexts is steadily increasing, as these agents are used to foster engagement, support personalized learning, and create interactive experiences. In these contexts, empathy towards a social robot is a crucial mechanism to build trust, motivation, and social connections. Narrative framing has been shown to support the elicitation of empathy. However, little is known about how children’s empathy towards robots is affected by different narrative framing and how individual factors shape this relationship. Across two preregistered experiments, we investigated 7-15-year-olds’ empathy towards a social robot in focus groups (Experiment 1; n = 19) and the effect of narrative framing (sad vs. neutral), baseline empathy, age, and gender thereon in an experimental study (Experiment 2; n = 73). Experiment 1 showed that robot perception, personal experiences, and social norms affected children’s empathy towards a robot. Experiment 2 showed no significant effects of narrative framing, age, or baseline empathy on children’s empathy towards the robot. However, varying the narrative framing of the robot resulted in gender differences in elicited empathy, with girls showing higher empathy than boys in the neutral narrative condition. Our findings indicate that contextual and relational cues might exert a stronger influence on children’s empathic responses towards robots than developmental factors or dispositional traits specific to individual children. The two experiments that compose this study offer\nvaluable insights into how empathy might be elicited through social robots. These insights hold promise for informing how best to design robotic agents that children can connect with in meaningful and effective ways in education and learning contexts.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive effort is a characteristic but understudied feature of many pro-environmental behaviors, and traditionally, it is mostly discussed as a barrier that keeps people from behaving pro-environmentally. In contrast, contemporary frameworks of cognitive effort show that effort can also be beneficial, for example by increasing the subjective value of the outcome of an effortful action. From this new perspective, we conducted an exploratory secondary analysis of existing data from an online study (N = 1160) featuring the Work for Environmental Protection Task (WEPT), which allows participants to exert real cognitive effort in exchange for donations to a pre-selected pro-environmental organization. We found that after performing the WEPT, participants were more likely to donate additional bonus money to their assigned organization compared to an alternative organization, suggesting a higher subjective value of the former. To assess the robustness of this finding, we conducted a high-powered, preregistered confirmatory study (N = 801). We found that the differential pattern in the donation decisions replicated with a larger effect size and was also consistent with self-reported subjective value of the organizations. These findings indicate that spending effort for the benefit of a pro-environmental organization can increase the value assigned to that organization. This resonates with the idea that effort is more than just a barrier and can have a positive effect on pro-environmental behavior.",

          "abstract": "Working memory and processing speed were previously shown to mediate the effect of age on real-world path integration performance, and the current study investigated whether such mediating effects could similarly apply to visual path integration in a virtual environment. Neuropsychological assessment showed letter-number sequencing performance as the only working memory variable that mediated the effect of age on path integration performance. Self-reported computer experience, performance in another test of working memory (spatial span), and tests of processing speed (letter and number comparisons), and verbal memory (California Verbal Learning Test), all failed to mediate the age effects on path integration performance. Taken together, we interpreted these findings as representing a divergence between the visuospatial processes engaged when performing the spatial span and visual path integration tasks, and that the cognitive test measures of processing speed might be less sensitive to visual path integration performance, which indexed less perceptual processing than real-world path integration due to the absence of proprioceptive cues. Importantly, this study demonstrated path integration as an inherently complex navigation task that may engage cognitive processes or functions differently under distinct environmental or testing conditions. As a marked decline in path integration ability is commonly observed among older adults who are at risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the current findings will have positive benefits for future studies that aim to pinpoint the cognitive processes or factors that mediate or underlie the navigational difficulties of aged individuals with incipient AD.",

          "abstract": "The promise of social robot applications for children’s education has attracted growing enthusiasm over the past decade, with the potential to augment and support diverse learning outcomes. However, the adoption of education robots and their expected benefits for children are yet to be\nrealised, due to complexity, cost, and variability between robots. Soft robots offer a possible solution. However, a concern is that these robots may be seen as less competent, decreasing their adoption and utility in learning environments. In this preregistered, mixed-methods study, we investigated teachers’ (n = 120) perception of 12 hard and soft social robots along different dimensions, learning tasks, roles, and contexts. Teachers perceived hard robots as more competent, human-like, and familiar than soft robots. Soft robots were perceived as more physically/visually warm. Hard robots were also more likely to be perceived as suitable for “technical tasks” and adopting a teacher/tutor role for supporting the learning of adults or groups. Soft robots were more likely to be evaluated as suitable for use with younger learners in individual learning contexts and playing the role of a co-learner/novice. This study provides a detailed account of how soft and hard robot features influence teachers’ perceptions of robot suitability for education applications. The findings directly inform how to optimise the design and situation of social robots to maximize adoption, effectiveness, and accessibility across diverse learners and learning contexts. By highlighting the nuanced trade-offs between competence and warmth, this research challenges theoretical assumptions that complex hard robots are universally superior in educational settings.",

The objectives of the current study were to: 1) identify developmental trajectories of emotional and behavioural difficulties, from preschool to adolescence, for the five Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) scales; 2) identify for each scale the variables that contributed to the likelihood of a child being in a high problem trajectory; and 3) examine the trends and relative risk of belonging to a specific trajectory group over time by analyzing variables that were repeated over multiple waves. \nMethods.  The study utilized data from an Australian longitudinal cohort of 1,910 children recruited at age 8 months. Parent-reported SDQ data were collected across seven waves from ages 4 to 13 years, with additional child, environmental, and parental concern variables. Person-centred group-based trajectory models were employed to identify developmental trajectories for each of the five SDQ subscales.     \nResults. Depending on the scale, four or five development trajectories were identified. Quality of Life was identified as a protective factor, while global temperament (where a child is perceived to be more difficult by a parent), specific child temperament traits, maternal distress, socio-economic disadvantage, early parental concern, and maternal education level were predictors of being in a high problem trajectory. Notably, these predictors varied across different scales. Additionally, two variables introduced in later data collection waves - number of social activities and a health concern report from a health professional - were significant predictors. \nConclusions. The findings underscore the importance of capturing parental perspectives of their child’s early behaviors, alongside other measures of child, family and environmental factors. Specifically, asking parents about perceived difficulty of their child (the global temperament question) could help identify children at risk of emotional and behavioral problems in the early years, thereby facilitating timely intervention.",

          "abstract": "Moderated multiple regression is one of the most established, popular methods to model non-linear associations in the social sciences. A mostly unacknowledged fact is that a particular type of non-normality can make the coefficient capturing this association non-zero. To further understand this connection, a theoretical investigation was conducted. A generalization of Isserli’s theorem from multivariate normal densities to all elliptical densities is presented. Through this generalization, it was found that the family of elliptical densities (which includes the multivariate normal) cannot generate a product-interaction term. Moreover, asymmetry in lower and/or higher dimensions can induce a product-interaction term. Special case studies are presented where the variables are unidimensional symmetric, but jointly non-symmetric, resulting in a moderated multiple regression model. A call is made for researchers to think carefully and decide when they have a true interaction term, theorized a priori, and when non-normality is mimicking an interaction effect.",

The strongest unification of these variables to come out of cognitive psychology is in the sequential sampling model framework, in which evidence accumulates in a noisy fashion until a threshold for a given response is reached. In this chapter, we provide an overview of these models within the memory domain. We begin with the classical diffusion model along with the motivations for the \"full\" diffusion model which includes variability in drift rates and starting points and describe how such models can produce interpretable parameter estimates for testing psychological theory. In addition, we summarize the connections between diffusion models and signal detection theory, extensions to confidence, recall, and continuous responses, and how such models can serve as back-end decision models for theories of retrieval.",

          "abstract": "One of the most common method of eliciting false memories in the laboratory is the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm (Deese, 1959; Roediger \\&amp; McDermott, 1995), where participants study a set of items that are all similar to a non-presented critical lure. A common finding is that false recognition to critical lures is much higher than to other non-presented items and in some cases is even comparable to true recognition, regardless of whether similarity is semantic or structural (e.g., phonological or orthographic) relations. While there exists a handful of computational models of this paradigm, they have only been applied to semantic but not structural false recognition, they have not been fit at the level of individual participants, and they have not been applied to response times (RTs). We present a global matching model that addresses all three of these current gaps. Global similarity of semantic and structural representations drives a pair of linear ballistic accumulators, which are used to produce decisions as well as complete RT distributions. In addition to being able to account for heightened false recognition of critical lures, the model was able to account for differences across both individual participants and items, lower correlations between semantic and structural false recognition than true recognition, differences in false recognition across levels of processing, improved true recognition but not false recognition with higher study time, and heightened false recognition under speed emphasis. The model suggests that semantic and structural false recognition can be explained using only a single retrieval mechanism.",

Study aims were to: (1) learn about participants’ experiences with and reasons for attending one-to-one TCTSY; (2) describe and compare participants’ experiences between group and one-to-one yoga settings; (3) explore participants’ perceptions of the impacts of TCTSY on their trauma healing; and (4) document participants’ intentions for continued one-to-one TCTSY use. Semistructured interviews were offered to participants at completion of a longitudinal observational study of one-to-one TCTSY; 4 of the 10 participants agreed to be interviewed. Interviewees were located in the United States and self-reported experiencing childhood trauma and a current PTSD diagnosis. Following the consensual qualitative research method, domains were initially created deductively by the team. Adjustments, as well as categories and core ideas, were created inductively. Results indicated that participants: (1) preferred one-to-one over groups because of perceived safety and comfort; (2) had positive experiences with TCTSY; (3) perceived biopsychosocial benefits from the practice and described using TCTSY principles outside of sessions; and (4) intended to practice indefinitely. This study provided insight to the lived experiences of participants who use TCTSY as complementary care. Yoga facilitators and clinical trauma care providers are recommended to collaborate to offer one-to-one somatic-based approaches to create more access options for trauma healing.",

A common prototype of allyship is bravely calling out the bias of perpetrators. Yet, conceptualized so narrowly, men’s allyship toward women could be ill-fitting for men with heart-based character strengths such as kindness and social intelligence. Using pre-registered person- and variable-centered analyses, we examined how well 10 allyship strategies were perceived as personally good-fitting in an international sample (N = 3,863; from 103 countries) of employed men with high gender equity values. ‘Giving credit/deference to women’ and ‘cheerleading for women’s career advancement’ (relationship-building strategies) were rated best-fitting, whereas ‘calling out’ (a committed allyship strategy) was by far the worst-fitting. Person-centered analyses revealed that men in our “high potential” profile (high in bravery, fairness, kindness, perspective, and social intelligence) rated both relationship-building and committed strategies as better-fitting than did other men. Exploratory variable-centered analyses indicated that kindness and social intelligence, strengths of the heart, were associated with more allyship strategies than any of the other 22 strengths we tested.

          "abstract": "This study examines how emotional tone and mental-health discourse influence participation in Reddit communities focused on dating apps. We analyzed more than 378,000 posts, collected between July 2022 and June 2025, from five major subreddits dedicated to dating apps, including r/Tinder, r/Bumble, r/hingeapp, r/OkCupid, and r/onlinedating. Posts were processed with transformer-based sentiment analysis and through a BERT-based classifier (PsychBERT) that allocated content into mental health categories such as anxiety, depression, social anxiety, loneliness, and mental illness. Three key patterns emerge. First, the overall tone of discussion is persistently negative and becomes increasingly so over time, suggesting a gradual deterioration in the emotional climate of these communities. Second, mental-health framing is widespread but uneven: social anxiety is especially prevalent, while explicit references to depression or mental illness appear less frequently and decline relative to neutral content. Third, community responses show a selective amplification of vulnerable disclosures. Posts that explicitly reference loneliness, depression, or anxiety receive markedly higher community support, and emotional intensity itself predicts greater visibility through Reddit’s scoring system. These findings demonstrate how dating-related online forums do more than host individual narratives: they actively shape the collective emotional environment by rewarding certain kinds of disclosures. The results highlight an interplay between platform design, community norms, and patterns of self-expression that can validate distress but also reinforce negative affect at scale.",

          "authors": "Simon Weber; Sarah Anne Kemp; Mark R. Hinder",
          "abstract": "Action cancellation represents a fundamental aspect of human motor control, though the behavioural paradigms used to assess it are methodologically diverse, and capture an incompletely understood combination of processes. Advancing theoretical accounts of action cancellation have motivated increasingly complicated experimental designs, leading some authors to draw comparisons between “simple” and “complex” stopping tasks. The latter describes a mix of paradigms which variably require increased working memory demands, stimulus discrimination, distractor interference, or more complex stimulus-response mappings. This narrative review provides an accessible explanation of commonly implemented complex stopping tasks, selected based on their relevance to current theoretical debates. Throughout, we describe the challenges associated with interpreting performance in these tasks, and highlight future directions for research. Notably, much of the past work using these tasks has applied traditional methods of indexing the speed of stopping, which were developed specifically for simple stopping tasks, and do not generalise well beyond this context. Recent research using cognitive modelling and physiological approaches has failed to replicate earlier findings, raising fundamental questions regarding how action cancellation should be indexed. Furthermore, physiological observations in complex stopping tasks appear to be incompatible with current accounts of the neurological mechanisms that underpin action cancellation. We propose potential ways forward, highlighting how the current lack of well-controlled comparisons between task types means the literature risks extensive task-specific findings that fail to generalise between laboratories, and – critically – beyond the laboratory.",

          "abstract": "Social environments present opportunities for connection and resources, but they also involve the risk of rejection. How do people learn which individuals will reject or accept them upon entering a novel environment? Here, we propose a route to such learning: people use knowledge of relationships in social networks to infer who will be likely to accept or reject them. Previous research shows that people generalize trust from one individual to that individual’s friends, yet it remains unclear whether rejection and acceptance experiences generalize in similar ways in social network contexts. We designed a novel experimental paradigm in which participants experienced rejection and acceptance within an artificial group, learned about network connections among group members, and decided which members to approach in a new task. Study 1 found that participants generalized rejection by avoiding individuals socially closer to a rejector and approaching those closer to an accepter, forming a gradient of avoidance and approach based on network distance. Study 2 further demonstrated stronger generalization when networks reflected friendship as opposed to randomly assigned ties, suggesting partner choices depend on explicit inferences about meaningful relationships rather than associative learning alone. Finally, in a longitudinal survey of student groups, Study 3 extended these findings to real-world social networks, revealing similar patterns of generalization in college student organizations. Together, our findings inform the cognitive processes that help humans successfully navigate social environments by adaptively forming new connections.",

          "authors": "Hongyang Liu",
          "abstract": "Dual-process theories posit that fast, intuitive System 1 often produces bias, whereas slow, deliberative System 2 corrects it. This manuscript challenges that traditional view by synthesizing theory and evidence on motivated System-2 reasoning (MS2R)—the tendency for deliberation to be co-opted in defense of identity-relevant beliefs. Across domains (e.g., climate risk, vaccines, gun policy), polarization has been shown to increase with subject-matter knowledge or numeracy when issues implicate social identity, whereas the same abilities improve accuracy for identity-neutral problems. Six complementary mechanisms are reviewed to explain these effects: (a) confirmation bias and motivated skepticism; (b) identity-protective cognition; (c) belief as value-signaling (expressive utility); (d) cognitive dissonance and conflict rationalization; (e) the argumentative theory of reasoning; and (f) bounded/resource-rational approaches (e.g., BIASR) that yield selective trust as an efficient but polarizing heuristic. Boundary conditions and critiques are then considered. High-powered replications indicate a robust directional motivated-reasoning main effect but limited evidence that higher ability amplifies bias uniformly; design features (ambiguity, incentives, audience visibility) and affect-first gating appear pivotal. Identity-congruent responding is further reinterpreted as instrumentally rational signaling under reputational and career incentives, especially for elites. Finally, actionable countermeasures are proposed: accuracy prompts and incentives, self-affirmation and identity-safe framing, symmetric-scrutiny protocols (e.g., steel-manning), probabilistic forecasting with feedback, clarity-enhancing data displays and preregistered criteria, and prebunking. Research prospects include sharper operationalization separating ability, disposition, and state engagement; process-tracing and psychophysiological markers to adjudicate mechanisms; and preregistered, multi-lab designs that vary ambiguity, incentives, and audience. Educational applications emphasize embedding accuracy nudges, forecasting tournaments, and structured adversarial collaboration to realign System 2 from identity performance toward error detection.",

To investigate, we identified five recent field studies of real-world nudges in distinct domains and designed four styles of hypothetical scenarios to approximate each one. This setup allows for clear comparison of old field data with new hypothetical data. Across our 20 experiments (N=16,114), hypothetical scenarios nearly always estimated the correct direction of treatment effects. However, they varied widely in estimating magnitudes, making them unreliable inputs to real-world policy applications such as cost-benefit analyses. Our findings underscore the promising value of hypotheticals, but also the need for greater investigation into strategies to calibrate their estimates.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Longitudinal research finds that both dietary restraint and restriction prospectively predict binge eating; however, research on momentary and daily predictive relationships has been mixed. The current study aimed to evaluate a combined restriction-affect regulation model of binge eating that considers whether restriction is more likely to lead to binge eating when affect is not sufficiently regulated by restriction. \nMethod: One hundred and one women with binge-spectrum eating disorders completed a 14-day ecological momentary assessment study. Participants reported current negative affect multiple times daily and dietary restriction and/or binge eating on surveys completed after eating. A multilevel mediation model was used to evaluate whether negative affect mediates the relationship between restriction and binge eating at both within- and between-person levels. \nResults: The direct effect of restriction on binge eating was not significant at either within- or between-person levels. At the within-person level, restriction was not related to subsequent negative affect, but greater negative affect significantly predicted subsequent binge eating. There was a significant indirect effect of restriction on binge eating through negative affect at the between-person, but not the within-person, level.\nDiscussion: Results suggest that momentary restriction is not a clear predictor of later binge eating, regardless of negative affect, while negative affect and binge eating are clearly linked. Future studies should further consider the conditions (e.g., time of day, type of restriction) under which momentary restriction does and does not predict binge eating. Overall, these results underscore the importance of implementing affect-regulation skills in treatment for binge eating.",

The survey covered six domains: general use, frequency, importance, engagement, concerns, and support needs related to open science practices.\nResults: Most respondents reported positive attitudes toward open science, with preregistration (75% of total N) and data sharing (65% of total N) as the most commonly used practices. Descriptively, ECRs placed greater importance on these practices than their established counterparts, suggesting a potential generational shift. ECRs primarily reported concerns about insufficient knowledge and fear of errors, while established researchers emphasized workload and a lack of incentives. Both groups highlighted the need for increased time, resources, institutional support, and training.\nDiscussion: Although our findings are descriptive and limited by self-selection and sample bias, they offer initial insights into how open science is perceived and practised in the field.

Little is known about how early adversity affects musical engagement and its relation to adult resilience. Across two studies (Study 1: n=254; ages 18-65; Study 2: n=288; ages 18-55) we examined effects of exposure to dimensions of early adversity (unpredictability, threat, deprivation) on musical engagement and resiliency in adulthood. Individuals exposed to early unpredictability showed increased emotional absorption into music. Increased absorption mediated associations between early unpredictability and adult resilience. Absorption was associated with escapism, specifically adaptive motivations to seek positive affect, offering a mechanism for music’s adaptive effects. These findings posit musical absorption as an accessible tool for resilience, especially following early life unpredictability.",

In this paper, we first use simulations to examine how different data-generating models affect bias in commonly used models that include cross-lagged effects. We then examine patterns of stability in over 400 variables from a 22-year panel study from Australia to assess plausibility of the parameter values from the simulations and to help evaluate risk of bias. Empirical results show that patterns of stability in real data are often inconsistent with expectations from commonly used models that fail to incorporate a state component. Simulation results show that bias in estimates from these commonly used models will likely be high, given these patterns of stability. Alternative models that include state components are recommended to more accurately account for patterns of stability and to reduce bias in estimates of lagged effects.",

We evaluated 20 large language models (LLMs), ranging from 1 to 120 billion parameters, on their ability to estimate fine-grained sentiment in transcripts of naturalistic speech. All models were open-weight, meaning their parameters are publicly available and can be run locally without reliance on cloud services. Two datasets were used: the Stanford Emotional Narratives Dataset, autobiographical stories from community participants, and the Bipolar Longitudinal Study, daily audio journals from outpatients with severe mental illness. Human sentiment ratings served as the reference, and models were benchmarked against both individual human agreement and lexicon-based tools (LIWC, VADER). Results showed a three-tier accuracy pattern: small models performed at or below baseline tools, mid-sized models (7-30 billion parameters) matched human agreement, and larger or optimized models exceeded it. Accuracy improved with scaling up to ~12 billion, after which gains plateaued, highlighting diminishing returns beyond mid-sized architectures. Performance was robust to transcription source, indicating AI transcription error did not impair accuracy. Fairness analyses showed overall accuracy was equitable across demographic groups, though modest disparities appeared in prediction consistency by participant race and education. These findings demonstrate that recent open-weight LLMs can match or surpass human-level performance in sentiment analysis of naturalistic speech while running efficiently on affordable workstation hardware. These advances open opportunities for studying emotional dynamics in daily life and developing privacy-preserving tools for clinical research.",

          "abstract": "Initial research, within the field of cognition and positive psychology, demonstrates the benefits of future thinking interventions such as the best possible self-technique (BPS) for the treatment of anxiety-related distress. However, despite these promising findings, attempts to gather feedback on the use of future thinking techniques is scarce. The present paper details the results from three focus groups designed to gather feedback on the best possible self-technique for the treatment of anxiety disorders. 13 participants (10 with lived experience and 3 trainee clinicians) participated in one of three focus groups. All sessions were audiotaped and fully transcribed verbatim. Participants acknowledged that future thinking is often a source of distress and viewed the BPS technique as potentially helpful in creating a safe mental space. However, participants emphasised the value of breaking down BPS goals into smaller, manageable steps. Additional feedback included recommendations regarding the terminology used, preferred modes of delivery, and considerations around the accessibility of the technique for specific populations. Findings are discussed in relation to existing literature, and implications for the refinement and implementation of the best possible self-technique are outlined.",

          "abstract": "Empathy plays a crucial role in fostering prosocial behaviour. However, empathic processes\nare influenced by in-group bias, such that individuals tend to empathise more with their in-\ngroup members. This study aims to test if training individuals to look longer at out-group\nfaces can help reduce in-group bias in empathy by improving attention to out-group\nmembers' suffering. Four lab-based experiments (N = 240) assessed the training's impact on\nvisual attention, implicit bias, and empathic selection. Gaze training successfully increased\nattentional focus on out-group members' pain expression and reduced implicit racial bias.\nFurthermore, pupil dilation—a marker of emotional engagement—toward out-group pain\nincreased post-training. No significant changes occurred in explicit or motivational empathic\nchoices. The findings suggest that attentional allocation is a crucial early-stage mechanism in\nempathy that can be modified through gaze-training. However, to achieve broader empathic\noutcomes may require additional interventions targeting motivational components of\nempathy.",

This meta-analysis synthesizes longitudinal data from 157 studies, involving demographically diverse samples from a wide range of cultural contexts (32 countries), to examine the pandemic’s impact on children aged 0–12 and the moderating effects of political restrictions. Results showed significant declines in social-emotional skills and well-being, and increases in behavioral problems compared to pre-pandemic levels. However, there were no further declines among studies conducted entirely during the pandemic. Political restrictions moderated the outcomes: stricter measures were associated with greater declines in well-being and increased externalizing problems.

          "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 850 million people worldwide, imposing not only substantial health burdens but also complex dietary management challenges. For kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), dietary restrictions often lessen post-transplant, yet the transition to a 'normal' diet is fraught with difficulty after years of externally imposed rules. In this context, intuitive eating, which emphasises internal hunger and satiety cues over external dietary mandates, may support the development of sustainable, self-managed eating behaviours. Despite the recent publication of a third version of the scale, the Intuitive Eating Scale-2 (IES-2) is currently the most widely-used measure of intuitive eating, but it has not yet been validated for use with KTRs. To address this gap, a mixed-methods validation study was conducted, integrating qualitative thinkaloud interviews with KTRs and a quantitative survey involving KTRs and a non-CKD comparison group, to evaluate the face, factorial and construct validity and internal consistency of the IES-2 within this population. Results from both qualitative and quantitative workstreams revealed critical psychometric and conceptual issues with the 'Unconditional Permission to Eat' (UPE) subscale, including compromised item discrimination, construct validity, and reliability, as well as responses being systematically influenced by participants’ experiences as KTRs. The original four-factor structure of the IES-2 was unsupported in both groups. Alternative models were tested, and an 11-item, three-factor structure excluding the UPE subscale demonstrated excellent fit across KTR and comparison samples. Although a third version of this scale now exists, there is no validation data available for people with kidney disease or solid organ transplantation, meaning these findings provide the first validated, contextually appropriate configuration of a scale of intuitive eating for use with KTRs, offering a robust tool to advance research and clinical practice in this population.",

          "abstract": "Determining when a past event occurred often requires inferring connections between related experiences rather than recalling a directly observed event time. While prior studies demonstrate that even children draw on temporal knowledge about familiar routines to infer retrospectively when events likely occurred, we know less about the learning mechanisms that support formation of such temporal knowledge and how those mechanisms develop and underlie gains in temporal inference. Here, 104 participants aged 7–25 years completed a temporal memory task in which participants repeatedly viewed four event sequences (“days”) comprising five unique events. Clock cues were presented between each event within a sequence, with those cues varying across sequence repetition. Thus, to learn the precise times of events, participants needed to encode the clock cue information and update it across sequence repetitions to infer the precise time of an individual event. We found that while order memory for events within a sequence reached adult-like levels in early adolescence, the ability to infer precise event times from the clock cues continued to mature into adulthood. Moreover, when clock cues were more variable and uncertain across repetitions, children and adolescents showed less precise temporal inferences that were biased toward the average times of events that shared a sequence position across the four “days”. Together, these findings indicate that developmental improvements in memory linking, wherein information is updated and combined across multiple episodic experiences, drive age-related gains in the precision with which individuals infer the precise timing of events.",

          "authors": "Rebecca J. Linnett; Noelle Robertson; Stephanie J. Hubbard",
          "abstract": "Intuitive eating is an adaptive eating approach characterised by having unconditional permission to eat when you are hungry, eating for physical rather than emotional reasons, relying on internal hunger and satiety cues, and honouring your health and practising gentle nutrition. The Intuitive Eating Scale-2 (IES-2) is currently the most commonly-used intuitive eating measure but, to date, there has not been a systematic review of how it performs psychometrically outside of the student sample in which it was developed. This systematic review aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the IES-2, including its associations with other variables, across all studies that used it as a measure of intuitive eating and reported psychometric data. MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of Science were searched in April 2022, May 2024 and June 2025, identifying 90 papers from diverse populations including college students, people from the general population/community, and people seeking treatment for eating disorders or weight management. Results were presented and synthesised narratively, and risk of bias was assessed using two domains from the COSMIN Risk of Bias checklist. Findings suggest that the IES-2 has good construct validity but underperforms psychometrically in other areas such as response distribution, subscale inter-correlations and dimensionality, particularly in relation to the ‘Unconditional permission to eat’ subscale. Alternative factor structures were reported on and a three-factor solution excluding the ‘Unconditional permission to eat’ subscale was found to have promising results. The review contributes a comprehensive account of the biopsychosocial correlates of the IES-2, as well as identifying that studies relating to weight or eating disorders often report mean scores that tend towards the extremes of the scale. Limitations include the exclusion of non-English translations of the IES-2, and future reviews would benefit from being conducted in other languages. PROSPERO registration: CRD42022299436.

          "abstract": "Level and variability are two key aspects of momentary self-esteem that are associated with mental health from early adolescence onwards, but little is known about their determinants. The current study examines how the trait-level use of four emotion regulation strategies—reappraisal, reflection, expressive suppression, social sharing—is associated with the level and variability of momentary self-esteem in the developmentally critical period of adolescence. Using mixed-effects location scale models, we analyzed experience sampling data from 408 adolescents (14 to 22 years, 81.62% girls) who reported their momentary self-esteem up to 35 times across one week. Two findings stand out: First, adolescents who tended to engage more in reappraisal, reflection, and social sharing to regulate their emotions experienced higher momentary self-esteem levels, whereas those who tended to engage more in expressive suppression experienced lower levels. Second, the tendency to use expressive suppression was consistently linked to more variability in momentary self-esteem. We discuss the contribution of emotion regulation strategies to levels of momentary self-esteem in adolescence and highlight the need for further research into the mechanisms underlying its variability.",

          "abstract": "Humans are remarkably efficient at learning new tasks, in large part by relying on the integration of previously learned knowledge. However, research on task learning typically focuses on the learning of abstract task rules on minimalist stimuli, to study behavior independent of the learning history that humans come equipped with (i.e., semantic knowledge). In contrast, several theories suggest that the use of semantic knowledge and labels may help the learning of new task information. Here, we tested whether providing existing, semantically rich task rules and response labels allowed for more robust task encoding and less (catastrophic) forgetting and interference. Our results show that providing semantically rich task rules and response labels resulted in less task forgetting (Experiment 1), both when using pictorial symbols or words as labels (Experiment 2). Using artificial recurrent neural networks fitted to task behavior, we show that the semantically rich learning conditions resulted in more separated task representations during learning. Finally, using a subsequent value-based decision-making task and reinforcement learning modeling (Experiment 3), we demonstrate how the learned embedding of novel stimuli in semantically rich, representations, further allowed for a more efficient, feature-specific processing when learning new task information. Together, our findings show the benefit of using semantically rich task rules and response labels during novel task learning, thereby offering important insights into why humans excel in continual learning and are less susceptible to catastrophic forgetting compared to most artificial agents.",

          "abstract": "Individual ratings of people, political parties, and objects are contingent on comparisons with standards raters may not be aware of. In this vein, striking evidence from attitude research suggests that previously answered questions affect responses to subsequent attitude questions such that previous questions provide a frame of reference. It stands to reason, however, that previously responded-to items are less influential in self-report assessments of personality because personality is self-referential and assumed to be more stable and consistent than attitudes. Across four experiments (ntotal = 4,895), we tested whether univariate, bivariate, and multivariate properties of the Big Five Inventory-10 and HEX-ACO-18 personality scales differ as a function of the type of items a person has responded to already (i.e., buffer items, items with the same or opposite keying directions, respectively, or no additional items in a control group). Across groups, little variation occurred in the responses and subscale-specific inter-item correlations, and measurement invariance did not hold across conditions. These findings militate against what we refer to as the item context effect for personality assessment and suggest that researchers need not worry too much about the order in which they administer their target measures. Further steps for advancement and refinement are presented.",

Using Reflexive Thematic Analysis, we identified two overarching themes that promote positive fan-club relationships: the importance of communication and club action on fan concerns. The communication theme split into two subthemes: club communication to fans, and opportunities for fans to communicate back to their club. Identity leadership dimensions, specifically identity entrepreneurship and advancement, cut across all themes. We conclude that communication and action are mechanisms through which football clubs can engage in identity leadership and promote positive fan-club relationships.",

German 6- to 9-year-olds were tested on their ability to recognize words in English utterances that overlapped in form with their L1 translation equivalents (e.g. cognate words, milk-Milch /mɪlk/ - /mɪlx/) or did not (e.g. noncognate words, smoke - Rauch, /smoʊk/ - /raʊ̯x/). L1 form similarity neither influenced performance at the group level nor when differences in individual L1 skills were considered. This pattern of results remained even when, in Experiment 2, the L1 word form was pre-activated visually. Unlike adults’, pre-EFL learners’ recognition of words in continuous speech does not seem to be affected by form similarity to the L1, which we link to differences in how form-meaning mappings are relevant in FL learning across development.",

Drawing on the disease–illness–sickness triad, I evaluate these experiences from clinical, personal, and societal perspectives, highlighting the current label’s multifunctional but ambivalent nature.\nI then introduce and critically assess three alternatives to the current label: elimination, clinical case formulation, and self-identification. Each addresses certain shortcomings of the existing label, but none preserves the full range of its functional value.\nFinally, I outline a proposal for a revised, neurodiversity-affirming diagnostic label. Two core reforms are advanced: [1] a co-produced reformulation of diagnostic criteria, integrating first-person perspectives and reducing deficit-based language; and [2] the replacement of the impairment criterion with a contextualised assessment of person–environment mismatch.\nI hope this Community Perspective can help to stimulate further discussion on the future of the autism diagnostic label.",

In  an  influential  study, Hajcak and Foti (2008) explored the idea that errors could trigger defensive motivational reactions and  that  the  ERN  might  forecast  the  intensity  of  defensive  reactions  following  errors.  Using  a flanker task, thirty-one college-aged participants responded to the direction of a central arrow with acoustic  startle  probes administered  pseudo-randomly  throughout.  Hajcak  and  Foti’s  (2008) findings indicated the ERN is indicative of individual variations in aversive reactions to errors.

As  part  of  the #EEGManyLabs project, an international network of laboratories, we will test the replicability of the results from this influential study. The data will later be combined to compute global effect sizes of the ERN, startle potentiation, and their interaction. Collectively, these replications will help solidify the results from this highly-cited study.

What psychometric structure best fits these features (unidimensional, multidimensional, bifactor)?  How is eustress related to distress and wellbeing?  Can individuals be clustered effectively into different eustress profiles?  To address these issues, we developed a novel eustress instrument:  the Comprehensive Hierarchical Eustress Review (CHER), motivated by a new model, the Comprehensive Hierarchical construct of Eustress (CHE).  Analogous to the CHE model, the CHER instrument contains three subscales for CHE’s three sources of eustress (goal-directed action, momentary experience, stable qualities) with 47 items that reflect the 47 features of eustress that CHE extracted from the literature.  To evaluate CHER and explore its potential for understanding eustress, we assessed it in a well-powered adult UK sample (N = 260).  Using confirmatory factor analyses, we found that eustress is best understood as both a unidimensional and a multidimensional construct (i.e., a bifactor model), with items from all three subscales contributing to its conceptual core.  The best performing model exhibited desirable internal qualities (satisfactory reliability and item discrimination) and external qualities (eustress negatively related to distress and positively related to wellbeing).  Using latent profile analysis, we identified four clusters of individuals with different eustress profiles, who differed further on sociodemographic characteristics and personality traits.  Findings reported have theoretical, empirical, and interventional implications for future work on the generation of positive experiences in challenging situations.",

          "abstract": "Organisations are increasingly implementing extended reality (XR) in education, organisational training, and sports practice. However, the effectiveness of XR compared to conventional training methods, and the potential improvements that additional sensory information, such as haptic feedback, may offer are unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis compared XR with non-XR training programmes in improving psychomotor skill performance and assessed whether haptic feedback improved programmes’ effectiveness. Eight databases were searched on June 30th, 2025, for randomised controlled trials quantitatively measuring the effectiveness of a psychomotor skill after an XR-based training programme. Sensitivity analyses, publication bias and risk of bias were assessed. Due to non-independence of effect sizes, robust variance meta-regression models were run and presented using forest plots. Seventy-eight reports were assessed, totalling 3546 participants. Both the post-training and pre-post-training change scores between XR and non-XR groups were assessed. Two RVEMR models were created by splitting the control groups into two types: passive (no training) and active (non-XR training). All models found statistically significant positive effects of XR training over non-XR training on task performance. No variables were found to be consistently associated with task performance, although haptic feedback showed a consistent, non-significant negative effect on task performance. Evidence certainty was limited by high heterogeneity, low-moderate risk of bias, and poor methods reporting. Overall, XR-based training generally appears to be beneficial for training psychomotor skills over and above conventional training. Further research into the role of haptic feedback and other potential predictive variables in performance outcomes is warranted. Researchers are also advised to improve methodological reporting to aid future evidence syntheses in this research area.",

          "abstract": "Following instructions is essential for academic success but challenging, especially for children, as it relies on working memory. Here, we used insights from working memory research to design and test ways to improve short-term maintenance of instructions in young adults and school-aged children. Participants memorized and executed sequences of spoken instructions under a baseline and three experimental conditions: additional free time, active verbal repetition, and passive repetition. In young adults, free time substantially improved performance. Passive repetition also improved performance, but not beyond the effect of free time. Active repetition, on the other hand, slightly impaired it. In 9-year-olds, active repetition also impaired performance, but free time provided little benefit. These findings demonstrate that providing more free time during instruction delivery improves performance in young adults but is far less effective in children, suggesting important developmental differences in the short-term maintenance of instructions and the (strategic) use of free time.",

          "authors": "Yannick Joye; Andreas de Block",
          "abstract": "For more than four decades, research on restorative environments has been guided by two influential theoretical frameworks: Attention Restoration Theory (ART) and Stress Reduction Theory (SRT). While these theories have been instrumental in shaping the field, they have also faced criticism. Although it might appear that the limitations of both theories could be resolved through adjustments and further research, we adopt a meta-theoretical perspective to assess ART and SRT against general standards of theory construction. We argue that neither framework meets core standards for predictive utility or explanatory power. We focus on two issues. On the one hand, critical constructs assumed to predict restorative nature experiences are often vague, circular (e.g., “soft fascination”) or underdetermined in terms of their level of specificity. On the other hand, both theories exhibit explanatory fragility: ART’s resource-based account of restoration does not clarify how depletion and replenishment actually occur, whereas SRT’s evolutionary explanation posits what appears to be an unnecessary and unfalsifiable adaptive mechanism. We conclude by challenging the assumption that the psychologically beneficial effects of nature are in some way “special” and instead advocate for greater epistemic restraint in building nature-specific theories around beneficial nature effects.",

          "authors": "Samuel Paul Bateman; Samuel James Vine; Tom Arthur; David Harris",
          "abstract": "The present work sought to develop a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between features of extended reality (XR) training interventions and successful training outcomes using a Bayesian Network (BN) model. We extracted data from 41 previous independent-group XR training studies, focusing on technology features (e.g., body visualization, visual fidelity, haptic feedback, personalization) and training design elements (e.g., continuous challenge, explicit feedback, training duration). We sought to elucidate the causal relationships between these variables to predict training success (both learning of the training task and transfer to new tasks) in sensorimotor tasks. The structure of our BN model was informed by expert knowledge, prior literature, and causal reasoning. The joint probability distribution over the model was then learned from the data extracted from previous studies. The model's performance was examined using cross-fold validation, yielding high precision (82.5%) and accuracy (77%). Performing probabilistic inference on the final model revealed nuanced insights into the effects of individual and combined features on training outcomes. Notably, haptic feedback, particularly when combined with body visualization, provided little benefit for learning of the training task, but did improve transfer of training. Meanwhile, continuous challenge emerged as the most influential training design feature for increasing the probability of transfer. Overall, the technology and training design features that were beneficial for transfer were often not beneficial for task learning, highlighting a critical distinction between short-term performance gains and the long-term retention and adaptability of skills across different contexts. These findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of how specific technology and training design features influence XR training success, paving the way for new theoretically-grounded applications of immersive technology.",

          "authors": "Angad Sahni; Ciara McCabe",
          "abstract": "Background: Depressed individuals are less reactive than controls to positive stimuli in the laboratory, yet mood brightening (MB) is when positive stimuli increase positive affect (PA) and/or decreases negative affect (NA) more in those with depression compared to controls, in real life.  Leisure activities and social company may drive mood brightening in depression, but their impact on anhedonia remains unclear, clarifying this could inform intervention development.\nMethods: Participants (N=71, mean 20yrs) with a range of depression and anhedonia symptoms provided 6 days Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data about their leisure activities and social company and NA and PA. In 2,177 ecological momentary assessments, we measured affective reactivity as the difference between PA and NA at the time of the activity/social company compared to two baselines: previous assessment (t-1, temporal instability) and within-subject mean. Longitudinal multilevel linear regression models examined the interaction between symptoms and affect reactivity to leisure and to social company.\nResults: Multilevel models revealed that those with higher depression (p&lt;0.05) and anhedonia symptoms (p&lt;0.025) had greater reductions in NA during leisure activity and that those with higher depression symptoms (p&lt;0.05) had greater reductions in NA during social company. These findings indicate MB effects of leisure activity and social company.\nConclusions: Although MB has been documented in depression this is the first study to examine a MB effect in anhedonia symptoms. We provide real-time evidence that encouraging individuals with depression and anhedonia symptoms to engage in leisure activities and seek out enjoyable social company could elevate their mood via a reduction in NA.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges for humanity in this century. Communicating in a way that raises awareness of the risk climate changes poses while at the same time not inducing negative feelings, like helplessness, is a challenge. Emphasizing the severity of climate change is related to higher risk perception, which could lead to more pro-environmental behavior. That, however, could trigger higher helplessness which is associated with lower motivation to act climate friendly. In our research we investigated the impact of induced controllability of the consequences of climate change on risk perception and learned helplessness. We conducted two experiments with N = 216 (gender-balanced) and N = 483 (quota-based sample) participants in Germany. Participants received six climate change scenarios that differed only in induced controllability (high vs low). There were four conditions: own control, control by government, hopeless, and a control condition. For both experiments results showed that participants’ risk perception increased after they read the scenarios, independent of the conditions. In Experiment 1 learned helplessness decreased for the conditions with high controllability. Surprisingly, for Experiment 2 results showed an overall decrease of learned helplessness independent of the conditions. When adding participants’ ratings on the pro-environmental behavior scale (PEBS-C) as a moderator variable, results showed that those who had higher ratings on the PEBS-C scale reported higher levels of helplessness for the scenario with the lowest controllability, compared to the control group. Our results emphasize the importance of including solutions when addressing the negative impacts of climate change.",

          "abstract": "Autistic masking has typically been understood as the knowing or unknowing suppression of naturalistic Autistic traits within neuronormative social contexts. However, social interactions are inherently embedded within broader sensory environments, suggesting a need to examine masking beyond the social domain. In this Perspective, we introduce and define the concept of Autistic sensory masking - the conscious or unconscious suppression, inhibition, or override of sensory responses to meet environmental or social expectations. Drawing on recent research and our own lived experience, we describe sensory masking, including how it may emerge developmentally - often as a learned adaptation to unsafe or invalidating sensory environments. We then discuss the effects of long-term masking. While sensory masking may sometimes serve a useful function, its chronic and persistent use may contribute to burnout and negatively impact wellbeing and mental health, particularly with long-term exposure to sensory aversive environments. Further, we distinguish sensory masking from two related concepts: sensory anchoring, which refers to the use of stabilising sensory input (via tools or movement) for self-regulation, and sensory unmasking, which involves an individual reclaiming autonomy through encountering safe spaces for sensory self-expression, and embodying flow states such as monotropism. We conclude by outlining constructive approaches that support sensory safety, self-regulation, and wellbeing, and propose future research directions to explore the mechanisms, impacts, and potential supports associated with sensory masking.",

          "authors": "Ann-Kathrin Krause; Jasmin Breitwieser; Garvin Brod",
          "abstract": "Students frequently rely on ineffective learning strategies instead of those that promote long-term retention. This tendency is commonly examined through the lens of self-regulated learning, which emphasizes students as generally active and deliberate decision-makers who may lack either the knowledge of effective strategies or the motivational resources to apply them. In this paper, we aim to expand this perspective by investigating the role of non-deliberate, habitual behaviors in students’ use of learning strategies. Drawing on key principles of habit and habit formation, we argue that particularly ineffective learning strategies tend to develop strong habitual tendencies. An overreliance on them may therefore stem not only from a lack of strategy knowledge but also from their automatic activation in response to environmental cues. We support this claim by both theoretically demonstrating how ineffective learning strategy use aligns with habit characteristics and empirically presenting first evidence showing that ineffective strategies exhibit stronger habitual tendencies than effective ones. By framing learning strategy use within a habit-based framework, we aim to offer a novel perspective on students’ persistence with ineffective strategies and suggest new intervention pathways that emphasize behavior-change strategies to foster effective use of learning strategies.",

This study explores team emergent states (team cohesion, team identification, team psychological safety) in Human-AI teams (HATs) compared to purely human teams (HTs). In a laboratory experiment, participants (final N = 67 teams; 134 individuals) completed two successive work-related tasks over two rounds (20 min each). The first round involved two human teammates. The second round introduced a third teammate – either another human (resulting in HTs) or an AI (resulting in HATs). Following the Social Identity Theory, we expected that HATs would exhibit lower levels of team emergent states. Team cohesion and identification were lower in HATs and we found mediating effects of self-rated team performance and team trust. There was no significant difference in perceived team psychological safety. Participants in HATs identified less with the AI than with the human teammate. These findings suggest that traditional team dynamics might not be directly applied to HATs, emphasizing the need for further research on team dynamics to understand the unique impact of AI on teamwork. This research advances our understanding of the implications of integrating AI into teams and provides practical insights for implementing AI while maintaining effective teamwork.",

          "abstract": "School-based mental health screening typically relies on single-time-point assessments, which may lead to inaccuracies in identifying students in need of support. Misclassification as either false positives (students flagged unnecessarily) or false negatives (students needing help but overlooked) can have significant consequences. Mood monitoring, a method that involves repeated assessments over time, may offer a more precise and informative approach to screening. We conducted a mood monitoring study in two schools over seven weeks (United Kingdom, n = 413; Australia, n = 418). Students completed the Brief Emotional Experience Scale (BEES) weekly to assess fluctuations in emotional well-being. At the conclusion of the study, students provided feedback on their experience. While 79% of students maintained consistent moderate to high emotional well-being, 17% fluctuated above and below the threshold for low well-being, and 4% maintained consistently low emotional well-being. This suggests that a single-time-point assessment could misclassify up to one in six students. Additionally, over half of the students reported that mood monitoring helped them better understand their own well-being, and a substantial proportion indicated that it encouraged conversations about mental health with peers, parents, or guardians. By tracking emotional well-being over time, this approach may reduce misclassification errors and enhance students’ emotional awareness and communication about mental health. Future research should focus on optimizing the implementation of mood monitoring in different school contexts and assessing its long-term impact on student well-being.",

          "abstract": "This short review examines the effects of blue light exposure on human circadian rhythms, particularly its impact on melatonin suppression and sleep disturbances. While sunlight regulates our internal clocks, the growing prevalence of artificial light from digital devices has introduced significant blue light exposure, particularly in the evening. Blue light, with its higher energy and shorter wavelengths, has been shown to suppress melatonin more effectively than other wavelengths, disrupting sleep and human circadian rhythms. Beyond sleep disruptions, this alteration in circadian timing can lead to broader health concerns, including metabolic dysfunction, impaired gastrointestinal processes, and an increased risk of certain cancers. Despite the growing evidence of these adverse effects, many individuals remain unaware of the potential health risks posed by blue light exposure, especially in the evening and during sleep time. Practical solutions, such as blue light filters, device settings like night shift mode and reduced screen brightness, are recommended to reduce the harmful effects of blue light. To conclude, this paper calls for increased public awareness of blue light’s impact and emphasizes the need for further research into its long-term health implications, particularly regarding hormonal imbalances and mood disorders. It is also believed that an improved understanding of individual differences in susceptibility to blue light may also lead to personalized strategies for better circadian health in an advancing digital age.",

How scores on retrospective self-report measures of cognitive restraint and restriction relate to restrictive eating in daily life among women with eating disorders characterized by restrictive eating is unknown. In the current study, the Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory Cognitive Restraint (EPSI-CR) and Restriction (EPSI-R) subscale scores were: 1) compared across women with anorexia nervosa (AN; n = 58), bulimia nervosa (BN; n = 56), avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID; n = 31), and non-eating disorder controls (NED; n = 53), and 2) correlated with frequency of daily restrictive eating reported via two-weeks of ecological momentary assessment. EPSI-CR scores were significantly higher in the AN group than all other groups, and people with BN scored significantly higher than ARFID and NED groups, whose scores did not significantly differ. EPSI-R scores did not significantly vary between AN and ARFID, and these groups both scored higher than BN, who scored higher than NEDs. EPSI-CR scores were not significantly correlated with frequency of restrictive eating in daily life in any diagnostic group, suggesting that past-month cognitive restraint was not associated with dietary restriction in daily life. EPSI-R scores were strongly correlated with frequency of dietary restriction in women with BN and ARFID, but not women with AN, demonstrating a discrepancy between EMA and retrospective responses. Overall, results highlight the importance of differentiating cognitive restraint and restriction when assessing and treating eating disorders.",

          "abstract": "Action cancellation represents a fundamental aspect of human motor control, though the behavioural paradigms used to assess it are methodologically diverse, and capture an incompletely understood combination of processes. Advancing theoretical accounts of action cancellation have motivated increasingly complicated experimental designs, leading some authors to draw comparisons between “simple” and “complex” stopping tasks. The latter describes a mix of paradigms which variably require increased working memory demands, stimulus discrimination, distractor interference, or more complex stimulus-response mappings. This narrative review provides an accessible explanation of commonly implemented complex stopping tasks, selected based on their relevance to current theoretical debates. Throughout, we describe the challenges associated with interpreting performance in these tasks, and highlight future directions for research. Notably, much of the past work using these tasks has applied traditional methods of indexing the speed of stopping, which were developed specifically for simple stopping tasks, and do not generalise well beyond this context. Recent research using cognitive modelling and physiological approaches has failed to replicate earlier findings, raising fundamental questions regarding how action cancellation should be indexed. Furthermore, physiological observations in complex stopping tasks appear to be incompatible with current accounts of the neurological mechanisms that underpin action cancellation. We propose potential ways forward, highlighting how the current lack of well-controlled comparisons between task types means the literature risks extensive task-specific findings that fail to generalise between laboratories, and – critically – beyond the laboratory.",

In this study, we systematically tested people's ability to reason from information providers with different intentions. The task was an adaptation of Shafto et al (2014)'s rectangle game, where learners guessed a rectangle’s size and location based on provided clues. We examined reasoning based on information from four types of providers: a helpful provider, a provider who sampled randomly, and two misleading providers (who could mislead but not lie). We also varied whether people were given a cover story describing the provider in advance, or whether they could infer how helpful a provider was based on what the provider shared. Participants learned efficiently from helpful providers, aligning closely with the predictions of a normative Bayesian model, even without a cover story. However, while people usually recognized unhelpful providers, they struggled to identify and respond appropriately to misleading strategies. Overall, our results suggest a helpful bias: in our task, participants assumed helpful intent unless given explicit feedback, and even then, they did not fully adjust in line with Bayesian predictions. People also struggled to overcome this bias when learning from randomly sampled information, especially when they had experience being an information provider themselves (Experiment 3).",

          "abstract": "Background:  There is a general assumption that judges assess crimes more reliably than jurors or the general public. Reliability is fundamental for trust and validity. Here, I compare the variability of sentencing intentions of judges and lay people.\n\nQuantifying the variability of sentencing is difficult, because sentencing guidelines impose boundaries on sentence lengths, that cause problems for estimation. I compared two ways to circumvent these problems: (1) by analysing actual sentences as proportions of the guideline range, or (2) by assuming that observed sentences reflect a latent distribution of “true” intentions. In both cases, the primary outcome was the variability of judges’ sentences compared with lay people’s.\n\nMethods: I analysed published sentencing intentions of professional judges and lay people for the same fictional crime. The source study’s sentencing guidelines allowed terms in the range 3-20 years, and over half the participants’ sentencing intentions were at these boundaries. I accounted for these boundary effects by transforming the raw sentence intentions to either (1) to proportions of the allowed range, or (2) to an ordinal variable, with 4 levels (0-9, 10-14, 15-19 or 20 years), representing a latent normal distribution. I then analysed the transformed data using distributional regressions, to assess ‘dispersion’ (reliability) in relation to rater status (judge, lay person)\n\nResults: Accounting for floor and ceiling effects importantly improved estimation of reliability. Judges’ sentencing intentions were more variable than those of lay people in both analyses. The proportional (relative) and ordinal (absolute) methods of analysis estimated lower or higher mean sentences for judges.\n\nConclusion: Distributional regression can assess differential variability, as an indicator of reliability. The present results challenge the assumption that judges assess crimes reliably. This may help to explain the public’s lack of trust in the judicial system. It also throws into question the decisions of single expert raters in other high-stakes contexts.",

Across several follow-up experiments, we unpack possible factors which limited the effectiveness of social observational learning. Overall, the results suggest that social decision rule inference (inferring a partner's decision rule from observed choices) was a key bottleneck for observational learning.

          "abstract": "The neural mechanisms of infant speech perception are an important topic of cognitive neuroscientific research. One key theoretical question in this area surrounds the lateralization of infant neural speech responses. Specifically, it is important to determine whether infants have patterns of left lateralization for speech in their frontal and temporal lobes, as is commonly seen in adults. However, the spatial patterns of infant findings are inconsistent; some studies show the frontal and temporal regions of both hemispheres activating, while others demonstrate activation predominantly or only in the left hemisphere. This meta-analysis, for the first time in the field, examines studies using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to determine the field-wide pattern of activation of the frontal and temporal lobes when infants are exposed to speech. In this pre-registered meta-analysis, we first completed a literature search using keywords through various popular online databases: PubMed, Web of Science, and the UBC Library. Papers were screened according to a pre-determined inclusion criterion. Those selected for our review would be analyzed for their methodologies and activation results. We coded the results for each contrast for each paper (e.g., neural activation patterns to speech stimuli vs. baseline). Overall, there was not strong evidence for left lateralization in either the temporal or the frontal lobes. We also did not find evidence that any lateralization pattern changed with age. One analysis revealed that patterns of lateralization in the left hemisphere may differ depending on language familiarity, with a marginally significant pattern of left lateralization when infants hear a familiar language. Overall, this meta-analysis provides an overview of the current state of the field concerning localized neural responses to speech stimuli and provides a field-wide answer to the question of the patterns of lateralization to speech stimuli found in infancy.",

          "authors": "Matteo Visconti di Oleggio Castello; Fatma Deniz; Tom Dupré la Tour; Jack L. Gallant",
          "abstract": "One of the major goals of cognitive neuroscience is understanding how the brain represents information about its own internal states and about the external world. This goal can be addressed by creating encoding models that reveal the information represented explicitly in measured brain activity. Here we describe the Voxelwise Encoding Model (VEM) framework for creating encoding models with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The VEM framework provides several key advantages over traditional neuroimaging approaches. First, the VEM framework is applicable to most experimental designs, from classic factorial designs to complex naturalistic experiments such as movie watching or video games. This flexibility enables researchers to study brain function across multiple domains with the same analytical approach. Second, hypotheses about functional representations are defined and tested quantitatively by extracting feature spaces from experimental stimuli or tasks. These feature spaces quantify specific types of information potentially represented in brain activity and can range from simple human-derived labels to complex features generated by deep neural networks. If a feature space can be used to linearly predict brain activity, the brain is considered to explicitly represent features within that feature space. This prediction approach provides a systematic way to test hypotheses about functional representations. Third, the VEM framework implements robust data science methods to improve model estimation and minimize false positive results. Encoding models are estimated on a training set and validated on an independent test set. Testing in an independent dataset provides direct evidence that experimental findings generalize beyond the dataset used for model estimation. Finally, voxelwise encoding models can be created in each participant's native brain space without unnecessary information loss due to spatial averaging or template resampling required by conventional group analyses. This enables the VEM approach to reveal fine-grained functional organization in individual participants that might otherwise be ignored. In this article, we provide a comprehensive guide to the Voxelwise Encoding Model framework through all phases of research, from experimental design and data collection to the estimation and interpretation of voxelwise encoding models.",

          "authors": "Jim Soland; Joshua Gilbert",
          "abstract": "Survey measures are common in intervention research, but may suffer from biases such as socially desirable responding (SDR). While previous work demonstrates how unaddressed SDR can affect study results in observational contexts, the degree to which SDR may affect treatment effect estimates from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is less studied. To shed light on this issue, we examine empirical data from 10 RCTs from education, psychology, and health fields and compare estimated treatment effects from models that do and do not account for SDR. Results show that, with two exceptions, estimated treatment effects were mostly unaffected by SDR. We complement our empirical results with a simulation study to determine the degree of SDR necessary to bias treatment effects and find that severe SDR can bias treatment effects when not accounted for in the model. However, models accounting for SDR are more complex and produce estimates that are slightly downwardly biased despite being the data-generating model. We conclude with a discussion of recommendations for researchers using survey instruments as outcomes in RCTs.",

          "authors": "Luther Kalb; Micah Kaats; Erin Jones",
          "abstract": "Background: Life satisfaction is a cognitive self-appraisal of one's current circumstances, influenced by both external circumstances (\"bottom-up\" factors) and features of personality (\"top-down\" factors). Life satisfaction is consistently associated with physical and mental health outcomes, making it a public health priority; however, life satisfaction in the US has been precipitously decreasing. The purpose of this study was to identify factors that could be addressed by U.S. policy for the purpose of enhancing population-level life satisfaction.\nMethods: Data for this study came from Wave 1 of the Global Flourishing Study. Seventeen actionable/modifiable variables were selected as covariates. They included a wide variety of behavioral, socioeconomic, psychological, and health factors. All variables were dichotomized for the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) analysis, a decision-tree approach used for problems of classification. This supervised, nonparametric, multivariate method was employed to identify the most accurate set of classifiers for the continuous outcome: Life satisfaction. CART offers several advantages over traditional ordinary least squares regression, including making fewer statistical assumptions, automatically detecting nonlinear relationships, and handling a large number of variables without the risk of multicollinearity. The CART model was trained and tested using a 70/30 split of the US sample (n=38,312). The model was further tested for replication in a combined international sample of similar Western countries (United Kingdom, n=5,368; Australia, n=3,844).\nResults: Of the 17 potential covariates, only 5 were represented in the models: balance, satisfaction with relationships, purpose, mental health, and comfortability with income. Each of the three models had similar numbers of splits (5, 7, 5). In all three models, the CART analysis identified life balance as the primary node. Those with low balance (the left-hand split) had much lower life satisfaction than those who self-reported balance (nearly a 3-point difference in life satisfaction, on average). For those with low balance, mental health was the second node for all datasets, and relationship satisfaction was the final split in the test and international samples. For those with good life balance in the US (the right-hand split), the tree structure was slightly more variable, as splits on purpose, relationships, mental health and comfortability with income were observed. For the international sample, splits only occurred on relationships and purpose.\nConclusions: The results clearly show the primary factors related to life satisfaction. Life balance was the most important, followed by mental health and satisfying relationships for those with low life balance. For those with high life balance, relationships, purpose, and comfortability with income (in the US only) were most important. These findings partially diverge from our hypothesis, as balance served as the most important correlate of life balance. The study findings not only reveal the most important correlates of life satisfaction, replicated across multiple test samples, but also those that were surprisingly less important (e.g., physical health, participation in a social or religious group, exercise). The findings have significant implications for interventions and policy development since all factors included were chosen are modifiable.",

          "abstract": "How do people with different political ideologies process political information? Party cues test how people’s judgements on policy issues shift when shown a party/party leader’s endorsement or opposition to the issue. A meta-analysis (Ditto et al., 2019) found that liberals and conservatives were similarly receptive to party cues, shifting their judgement in accordance with their inparty and against their outparty. This finding was criticized, as the empirical studies included in the meta-analysis did not use a representative sample of target issues, limiting the generalizability of the meta-analysis’ conclusions. We address this critique in four preregistered experiments (N’s &gt; 1200), using four measures of ideology. Studies 1 and 2 found convincing evidence for ideological similarities in quota matched samples of Americans. However, Study 3 used a convenience sample and found conservatives were significantly more likely to follow partisan cues. In Study 4, we aimed to resolve this discrepancy using a representative sample of participants and found similarities in cue receptivity on most measures of ideology, except for right-wing authoritarianism. Notably, we replicated ideological differences in cognitive style, suggesting that ideological differences in cognitive style do not necessarily translate into differences in processes for interpreting and integrating partisan-relevant information.",

          "abstract": "Research on sensorimotor synchronization typically examines finger tapping to auditory rhythms. These studies generally investigate timing accuracy, largely neglecting the force of tapping, which provides information on exertion and thus is relevant to clinical applications of cued movement. In two experiments with healthy young and older adults, we examined the possible influence of i) cognitive function, ii) subjective factors, and iii) properties of music on the force of music-cued finger tapping, alongside possible aging effects. We found that better cognitive switching/inhibition ability inversely predicted tapping force, whereas more positively rated emotions induced by the music predicted greater tapping force. Despite known declines of motor and cognitive functions in aging, we found that age group was not a predictive factor of force, suggesting that age does not affect spontaneous force in finger tapping. We examined other relevant factors based on previous findings, including working memory, familiarity with the music, and whether the music was activating, but these also did not predict applied force. These findings demonstrate differential effects of cognitive differences and auditory cue aspects on motor control in finger tapping settings, with practical implications for improving training or rehabilitation that includes music-based movement.",

Additionally, global self-continuity mediated the relationship between self-concept clarity and pro-environmental behaviors, beyond the effects of self-esteem and positive affect (Study 4).

Our investigation consisted of five mixed-methods studies, including one large-scale survey and four experimental studies, all of which provided converging evidence supporting our hypotheses. Specifically, low self-concept clarity was either associated with (Study 1) or led to (Studies 2 &amp; 3) self-instrumentalization, and anxiety was identified as a key factor mediating this relationship (Studies 3 &amp; 4). Furthermore, we discovered that self-instrumentalization mitigates anxiety stemming from low self-concept clarity (Study 5).

Accordingly, this tutorial paper aims to provide an overview of NEST/equivalence testing procedures by describing the nature of the procedures, explaining when they should be used, defining what considerations should go into their application (including selecting a minimally meaningful effect size), and outlining how they may be conducted and interpreted.

          "abstract": "Hyperscanning, the simultaneous recording of multiple brains during social interaction, is an emerging method in social neuroscience. Among available techniques, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is particularly promising for studies outside laboratory environments. fNIRS hyperscanning presents opportunities and challenges in key domains including data processing, the quantification and interpretation of inter-brain synchrony, and increasing interest in multimodal approaches. To assess the field’s current status and trajectory, we developed a questionnaire for fNIRS hyperscanning researchers, addressing both best practices (“what has been done”) and future priorities (“what ought to be done”). Survey responses were compared with the empirical literature to identify unmet needs, align community perspectives, and chart a course for the field’s progression. Findings showed (i) broad agreement on preprocessing workflows, (ii) widespread use of wavelet transform coherence to quantify inter-brain synchrony, and (iii) growing enthusiasm—and a rapidly expanding pool of datasets—for multimodal recording. Meanwhile, (iv) systematic training in fNIRS hyperscanning is largely absent from university curricula, (v) theoretical frameworks for interpreting neural synchrony remain underdeveloped, and (vi) methodological pipelines integrating multimodal behavioral and neural signals are still lacking. By linking survey insights with existing literature, we highlight solutions and propose concrete steps for advancing fNIRS hyperscanning research.",

We found a consistent pattern of associations using the data from two culturally different samples of Polish (N = 1143) and British (N = 388) participants. That is, we observed consistent negative relationships between intelligence and socio-psychological variables responsible for out-group derogation: national narcissism and conspiracy beliefs. Moreover, lower national narcissism partially accounted for the association between higher intelligence and lower conspiracy beliefs, which provides initial evidence that higher intelligence may be related not only to a less narcissistic identity but also to weaker endorsement of conspiracy theories. We discuss the implications for understanding the role of intelligence and national narcissism in shaping the psychological roots of susceptibility to conspiracy narratives.",

Although EMA has been increasingly used to examine self-harm, existing reviews have not focused specifically on adolescents.

Five databases, plus pre-print, unpublished and grey literature sources, were searched up to 30 January 2024. Studies were included if published in English, used EMA methodology, included adolescents aged 10-24 years and measured suicidal ideation, suicidal behaviours, or self-harm. The review included 79 studies, published from 2009 to ongoing research. Self-harm was associated with numerous risk factors, including negative affect, stress, interpersonal influences and sleep. EMA was generally well-accepted by adolescent participants, with high compliance rates. The findings highlight the value of EMA in capturing real-time fluctuations in self-harm and associated risk factors among adolescents. EMA demonstrates strong potential for improving understanding and prediction of self-harm; yet challenges remain, including variability in study designs and a lack of clear reporting of the methodologies. Future research should focus on standardising methodologies, increasing participant diversity, and exploring the clinical utility of EMA in early intervention and prevention strategies.",

Using the same dataset, we demonstrate their predictive validity. The PPIS and NPIS uncover substantial differences in political attitudes and behaviors both between and within individuals who identify as politically (dis)interested.

          "abstract": "Driver visual attention is crucial for the safe transition of control from higher levels of automation to manual driving. Without efficient visual sampling of their surroundings during the transition process, drivers have an increased risk of collisions, due to reduced situation awareness, imposed by automated driving. The use of directional auditory warnings has been proposed as an effective way for guiding drivers’ attention to the right place at the right time, during transitions of control that require a lane change for obstacle avoidance. Here, directional auditory warnings either direct drivers’ attention towards a free lane (i.e., towards-free-lane warnings) or towards a hazard (i.e., towards-hazard warnings). Whilst studies have demonstrated that the towards-hazard warnings facilitate faster hazard detection, relative to non-directional warnings, little is known about the effects of towards-free-lane auditory warnings on gaze behaviours. Studies have also shown that temporal separation of auditory warnings and visual information can improve the effectiveness of warnings, by attenuating the visual dominance effect. However, the impact of this temporal separation on drivers’ gaze behaviour during transitions from automation remains unknown. Using a driving simulator study with forty-eight participants, we investigated how directional auditory warnings and asynchronous presentation of auditory warnings and visual information affect drivers’ gaze behaviour during transitions from a hands-on SAE L2 driving system. Results showed that, compared to non-directional warnings, directional auditory warnings reduced the probability of fixation to wing mirrors. Towards-hazard and towards-free-lane warnings effectively guided drivers’ visual attention to the hazard location and the free lane, respectively, and also led to faster fixations on these areas. However, under towards-hazard warnings, drivers still adhered to their habit of checking the free lane wing mirror during lane changes with these warnings. Finally, longer stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA) were associated with faster fixations to the wing mirrors and quicker hazard detection, suggesting that longer SOAs attenuated visual dominance effect, leading to an increase in the effectiveness of directional auditory warnings in guiding drivers’ visual attention. Findings from this study provide valuable insights for the design of in-vehicle warning systems in automated vehicles.",

Reasons for this vulnerability remain unclear. We investigated how peer bullying and family conflict (age 10-15 years) and loneliness and social connection (age 16-24 years) related at different levels of socio-economic marginalisation. \nMethods: Using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Survey (N=2,531), we captured loneliness and social connection at 16-24 years and bullying and family conflict at 10-15 years. Network analysis tested item-level relationships, whilst controlling for others. We devised a socio-economic marginalisation score, based on household income related to community average household income, to classify participants into high and low groups and to compare networks across groups. \nResults: Most central items in the full sample network were talking to family about worries, talking to friends about worries, and relying on friends (16-24 years), and peer bullying (10-15 years). Distinct facets of loneliness linked to specific social connection and bullying experiences. For example, feeling left out was associated with feeling let down by friends (w=-.10), feeling less understood by friends (w=-.05). Whereas feeling isolated was associated with feeling less understood by family (w=-.11) and less understood by friends (w=-.04). Peer bullying related to feeling more left out (w=.05) and more isolated (w=.04). Some associations (e.g., feeling less let down and less criticised by family) were stronger in the high socio-economic marginalisation group, who also reported more severe bullying. \nConclusion: Evidence suggested family relationships remain important in late adolescence. Findings highlight the value of item-level dynamics for targeted support. Past bullying, feeling let down, left out and isolated may be key intervention targets, especially for adolescence experiencing high socio-economic marginalization.",

          "abstract": "Studying metacognition, the introspection of one’s own decisions, can provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the decisions. Here we show that observers’ uncertainty about their decisions incorporates both the entropy of the stimuli and the entropy of their response probabilities across the psychometric function. Describing uncertainty data with a functional form permits the measurement of internal parameters not measurable from the decision responses alone. To test and demonstrate the utility of this novel model, we measured uncertainty in 11 participants as they judged the relative contrast appearance of two stimuli in several experiments employing explicit bias or attentional cues. The entropy model enabled an otherwise intractable quantitative analysis of participants’ uncertainty, which in one case distinguished two comparative judgments that produced nearly identical psychometric functions. In contrast, comparative and equality judgments with different behavioral reports, yielded uncertainty reports that were not significantly different. The entropy model was able to successfully account for uncertainty in these two different types of decisions that resulted in differently shaped psychometric functions, and the entropy contribution from the stimuli, which were identical across experiments, was consistent. An observer’s uncertainty could therefore be measured as the total entropy of the inputs and outputs of the stimulus-response system, i.e. the entropy of the stimuli plus the entropy of the observer’s responses.",

          "abstract": "People often rely on simulating the other person’s state of mind when trying to understand and predict their behaviour. Likewise, converging evidence suggests similar cognitive and neural processes are engaged when making decisions for ourselves and when predicting the decisions of others, pointing towards mental simulation as the underlying mechanism of prediction. In this study, we tested this hypothesis directly, leveraging the fact that, under the simulation hypothesis, any predictions made with a biased decision-making process should also be biased. We first induced a bias in participant’s risk perception by adapting them to contexts with high or low risks, and then asked them to predict decisions of a risk-seeking and risk-averse agent in a mediumrisk context. Our findings provide partial support for the simulation hypothesis; the adaptation manipulation resulted in biased predicted decisions, suggesting that these predictions were made with participants’ own (biased) decision-making system. Surprisingly, this behavioural effect only emerged during predictions for a risk-averse, but not risk-seeking agent. Modeling predictions with the drift-diffusion model suggested that the prediction bias mapped onto a group difference in the risk tendency parameter when predicting for the risk-averse, but not risk-seeking agent. Furthermore, participants’ risk tendency when deciding for themselves correlated with predicted behaviour of the risk-averse, but not risk-seeking agent, suggesting the perceived similarity of the other agent as a mediating factor. Altogether, our findings support the view that people engage in simulating others’ decisions with their own mind, but also suggest that the perceived similarity with the other person may determine their prediction strategy.",

          "abstract": "Despite growing research interest in early executive functions, little is known about how these fundamental cognitive skills emerge and develop in the first years of life. A key distinction within the literature separates “hot” (emotionally or motivationally influenced) and “cool” (affectively neutral) executive function skills. However, it remains unclear whether these skills follow similar or distinct developmental trajectories from infancy to early childhood. To fill this knowledge gap, this longitudinal study examined the development of hot and cool inhibitory control (a core executive function) across three time points in infancy and early childhood: 10-months (N = 141), 16-months (N = 75) and 3½ years (N = 93). To track age-related changes whilst minimising bias from differences in task demands, we used scalable or structurally similar inhibitory control tasks across all assessment points. As expected, both hot and cool inhibitory control significantly improved from infancy to early childhood, however the improvement happened earlier for hot inhibitory control. Hot and cool inhibitory control were not significantly associated in infancy, but a hot-cool association emerged by 3½ years. In terms of longitudinal stability, individual differences in hot (but not cool) inhibitory control were stable from 10- to 16-months of age, however neither facet of inhibitory control demonstrated longitudinal associations between infancy and early childhood. Hot IC at 16 months predicted performance on one of the cool IC tasks (Go/No-Go) at 3.5 years, although this result did not survive correction for multiple comparisons so should be replicated in future research. These findings provide new insights into the early developmental trajectories of hot and cool inhibitory control, highlighting both their initial independence in infancy and later convergence at the start of early childhood.",

          "abstract": "Objective:\nThis study evaluates the psychometric properties of the Short Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS) among adolescents from seven culturally and linguistically diverse countries.\nMethod:\nA total of 4,006 adolescents (ages 11–18) from 18 schools across Bahrain, Canada, Germany, India, Sweden, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates completed the SWEMWBS as part of a school-based wellbeing survey. Participants responded in either English (n = 3,358) or French (n = 648). We examined internal consistency (Cronbach’s α and McDonald’s ω), conducted confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test unidimensionality, evaluated cross-national measurement invariance using multi-group CFA (MGCFA), and applied Item Response Theory (IRT) analyses to assess item discrimination, response thresholds, and measurement precision.\nResults:\nThe SWEMWBS demonstrated acceptable-to-good internal consistency across all countries (α = .76–.82; ω = .76–.83) and a unidimensional structure with strong model fit (CFI = .983, RMSEA = .065). Full scalar invariance was supported across countries. IRT analyses showed that items 2 (\"feeling useful\") and 5 (\"thinking clearly\") offered the highest information, while country-specific patterns suggested subtle differences in item functioning. The test was most informative for adolescents with low-to-average mental wellbeing (θ ≈ −2.5 to +1.5). Intra-class correlation (ICC) indicated minimal school-level clustering (ICC = 0.037).\nConclusion:\nFindings support the SWEMWBS as a reliable, unidimensional, and cross-culturally valid measure of adolescent mental wellbeing. These results provide psychometric justification for its use in global adolescent health research.",

          "abstract": "Intergroup bias modulates both Theory of Mind (ToM) during social judgments, yet behavioural measures alone cannot fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Multimodal approaches are therefore needed to uncover the corresponding neural correlates. Here, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate how intergroup bias shapes neural responses during smile discrimination–a proxy for ToM. Thirty-three adults viewed videos of ingroup or outgroup members displaying genuine or posed smiles, judging smile authenticity (ToM) and smiler gender (Gender), with facial expressions recorded. Behaviourally, no intergroup bias emerged; however, neuroimaging data revealed distinct pathways: ingroup smiles engaged the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), whereas outgroup smiles activated the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). ToM conditions elicited stronger IFG and superior temporal cortex (STC) responses for outgroup members compared with Gender conditions. Although facial mimicry was absent, integrated fNIRS and facial analyses demonstrated that intergroup bias differentially recruits neural systems during ToM-driven smile processing. These findings indicate that social affiliation and cognitive control networks are sensitive to ingroup cues, while outgroup cues elicit greater mentalizing, potentially reflecting perceptions of outgroup members as less trustworthy and requiring more effortful interpretation.",

This largely underappreciated polysemy problem prevents associative accounts of biological cognitive systems from being properly articulated, understood and criticized. Based on a review traversing psychological, neuronal and behavioral sciences, we delineate and characterize these five categories of usage, to show how such classification improves transparency across fields and casts new light on various debates.

Despite this, little research exists on how university students cope with climate change from a psychological perspective. In this largely qualitative mixed-methods study, we analysed data from an online survey to investigate how students (N = 823) of a large UK university cope with climate change. This survey covered which climate change situations were triggering for them, preferences for support-seeking, and specific coping strategies. Conceptual content analysis revealed that challenging situations included navigating climate change information, climate justice issues, climatic changes and environmental losses, and climate change dismissal. Findings from qualitative framework analysis further showed four ways students coped with these: by reducing the mental load of climate change, doing something constructive, seeking social support and meaning, and doomist thinking and behaviour. While many students highlighted the importance of social connections, a small minority considered seeking professional support. These findings partly support and expand on climate change-related coping literature and have implications for how higher education settings communicate about and act on climate change.",

Such Neurodevelopmental Hyperacusis (HAND) is often part of sensory over-responsivity associated with neuropsychiatric differences. To better understand the impact of HAND on individuals’ lives, this study aimed to estimate the magnitude of the effect of HAND on quality of life (QoL) using causal inference. Given previously established relationships between sensory sensitivity and anxiety, we also aimed to estimate the role of anxiety as a mediator of this effect. We recruited 174 legal guardians of children (8–11 years old), and collected informant-rated scores for QoL, HAND, and anxiety, as well as data on confounders identified using a causal graph. There was a large total negative effect of HAND on QoL, with a significant proportion mediated through anxiety. Post-hoc analyses indicated that almost all domains of QoL were negatively affected by HAND, with especially large effect sizes for psychological, emotional and social domains. We discuss the results in the light of our causal assumptions and conclude that 1) intervention for HAND would likely improve both QoL and anxiety in affected individuals, and 2) anxiety treatment would achieve some, but not all, of this beneficial effect on QoL.",

Resilience acts as a protective factor for victims, helping to mitigate depression, anxiety, and social withdrawal while empowering bystanders to adopt prosocial behaviors. For perpetrators, fostering resilience can redirect aggressive tendencies into constructive leadership. The review synthesizes theoretical frameworks, empirical studies, and intervention strategies, highlighting the interplay of individual traits, family dynamics, peer networks, and school climates in shaping resilience. It concludes by emphasizing resilience-focused interventions, teacher training, and policy reforms as transformative tools for creating inclusive and supportive school environments.",

A significant effect of inhibitory control (better performance on accuracy and reaction time; p&lt;.001 [-.47, -32]) was found, such that performance was better when there was no inhibitory demand. This did not differ depending on the age of the infant (10 or 16 months), language background (monolingual or bilingual), or the interaction of age and language. This suggests that exposure to two languages (measured crudely) does not influence inhibitory control in young infants or at least may not be detectable in behavioural tests under 16 months old.",

          "abstract": "Statistical learning is a powerful mechanism that can support a variety of learning tasks. Many theories have assumed a single mechanism for statistical learning across different tasks, where a unitary mechanism is supposed to explain results from various studies, even across different modalities. In this study, we studied auditory statistical learning by comparing two different experimental paradigms, target detection and word segmentation, and examined if different mechanisms are required to explain results from the two paradigms. Previous work using the word segmentation paradigm suggested that learning is better with sequences containing uniform-length words than with sequences containing mixed-length words. If the same mechanism supports the target detection task, the same results are predicted. However, while learning was successful in both Experiments 1 and 2 with the target detection paradigm, the effect was larger in the mixed condition than in the uniform condition. We further replicated the uniform condition advantage in the word segmentation paradigm in Experiment 3. Thus, we hypothesized that the target detection paradigm required a different mechanism from those in word segmentation. To understand these mechanisms, we proposed both theoretical analyses and a computational model to simulate results from the target detection paradigm. We found that a prediction mechanism, rather than clustering, could explain the data from target detection. Crucially, this mechanism can produce facilitation effects without performing segmentation. We discuss both the theoretical and empirical reasons why the target detection and word segmentation paradigm might engage different processes, and how these findings contribute to our understanding of statistical word segmentation.",

Physical activity is a crucial element in managing the health of individuals with HIV, but African American men represent a population that is disproportionately affected by HIV and often faces barriers to engaging in regular PA. We analyzed data obtained from a randomized controlled trial (N = 302) that recruited African American men living with HIV who are 40 years or older and randomly assigned them to a PA intervention group or a health-awareness control group. We collected data at baseline, immediate post-intervention, and 3-, 6-, and 12-month post-intervention. We examined whether the intervention’s effect on adherence to PA guidelines was mediated through the Reasoned Action Approach and the Social Cognitive Theory constructs, including attitudes, social norms, self-efficacy, and intention. We explored whether individual characteristics, including Body Mass Index (BMI), Waist-Hip Ratio (WHR), age, education level, and marital status, influenced the intervention’s effect. We found that self-efficacy mediated the intervention’s effect (α×β×γ product = 0.125, 95% ACI [0.053, 0.229]) by influencing intentions. Statistical analyses did not identify significant moderations of the intervention effect by age, marital status, education level, BMI, or WHR. These findings suggest that interventions to enhance PA among African American men living with HIV should particularly focus on boosting self-efficacy to exercise. Future research should explore additional psychological mechanisms and potential moderators to further refine and tailor PA interventions for this population.",

This is especially important in countries like China, where family support is highly valued and families often live in extended family households. We used semi-structured interviews with 16 Chinese parents of autistic children from diverse educational and income backgrounds and focus group discussions with 11 service providers, to explore their perspectives of the role of extended relatives in the care of autistic children. Using template thematic analysis, we developed three themes: (1) Unambiguous active support from extended relatives: “my siblings and parents always remind me to take good care of my child”; (2) Complex or ambivalent support: “when it comes to grandparents, things can get complicated”; (3) Disengagement in care or stigmatising attitudes: “I felt they didn’t see my son as worthy”. Extended relatives’ supportive or unsupportive roles were perceived to be linked with the timing of a child’s diagnosis, early intervention opportunities, parents’ social and mental well-being, and family functioning. Each theme also considers the underlying individual and family characteristics that may influence the extended relatives’ willingness to support the autistic children and their parents. More effort is needed to help extended relatives better understand autism. This may include building on support from relatives who were already helpful, turning limited supporters into active partners, and addressing negative attitudes to reduce stigma; targeted support is especially needed for families from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.",

To date, research suggests that sports fandom may drive SVG play, as engagement in SVGs is an extension of sports consumption. Evidence also suggests that sports fandom is associated with more sports betting and other gambling. Despite these findings, research has yet to explore the differences between SVG players and non-SVG (NSVG) players across their video gaming and gambling engagement including measures of problem video gaming (PVG) and problem gambling (PG). The present study addresses this gap in the literature using online survey data from two independent samples from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk: N = 1,990, 53.1% Male; Mage = 40.14, SD = 11.80) and Academic Prolific (N = 2,212, 68.4% Male, Mage = 33.18, SD = 9.94). Results showed that SVG players had higher frequency video gaming and gambling, and greater prevalence of PVG and PG relative to NSVG players. Further, SVG players also reported higher frequency of video gaming-related gambling, such as loot box purchases and e-sports gambling, suggesting a strong overlap of video gaming and gambling among SVG players. This is the first study to show a significant risk for SVG players in terms of PG. The discussion focuses on the next steps for research.",

          "abstract": "Der Begriff Growth Mindset ist in den letzten Jahren zu einem festen Bestandteil pädagogischer, psychologischer und unternehmerischer Diskurse geworden. Ursprünglich im Kontext der Lern- und Motivationspsychologie entwickelt, steht das Konzept für die Überzeugung, dass Fähigkeiten bzw. Intelligenz nicht stabil, sondern durch Anstrengung, Strategiewechsel und Feedback entwickelbar sind. In Bildungseinrichtungen wird dieses Konzept häufig als ein Schlüssel zur Leistungssteigerung verstanden, in Unternehmen als Hebel für Lernbereitschaft und daraus resultierende Innovationskraft. Doch trotz seiner Popularität wird der Begriff oft vage verwendet. Die wissenschaftliche Auseinandersetzung mit dem Growth Mindset ist jedoch differenzierter als viele populäre Darstellungen vermuten lassen. Ziel dieses Kapitels ist es daher, das Konzept des Growth Mindsets systematisch zu erschließen, zentrale Modelle und theoretische Grundlagen darzulegen, Anwendungsfelder und Interventionen zu skizzieren sowie einige kritische Perspektiven zu beleuchten.",

          "authors": "Jens Fuenderich; Lukas Joscha Beinhauer; Frank Renkewitz",
          "abstract": "Heterogeneity has been proposed as a framework to improve psychological and behavioral science by identifying mechanisms that explain the differences between replications of an effect. Both in theory and in practice, the scope of such analyses has been limited to identifying how much effects vary, adding moderators to the meta-analytic model, and evaluating whether less residual heterogeneity remains to be explained. Notably, the underlying functional relationship between the independent and the dependent variable of the experiment is rarely considered as a contributor to effect heterogeneity. Ignoring its influence on heterogeneity, as well as additional information beyond the distribution of true effects, increases the risk of misinterpreting meta-analytic results. We introduce more elaborate descriptions of heterogeneity for such multi-lab projects that can serve as tools to assess if effect heterogeneity could be affected by non-linearity. Instead of focusing on a single heterogeneity estimate, we propose to identify patterns of heterogeneity that allow us to meaningfully connect meta-analytic practice with theory development. Further, the growing body of large-scale direct replication multi-lab projects provides a rich and still emergent basis for heterogeneity research to consider. We apply the analyses to an initial pool of 55 meta-analytic data sets to demonstrate the overlooked variety in patterns of heterogeneity and find evidence for and against the impact of non-linearity on replication effects. Finally, we discuss issues with design choices by previous multi-lab projects and future directions for a heterogeneity paradigm that is more attentive to the variety of contributors and patterns related to effect heterogeneity.",

          "abstract": "Accurate face recognition relies on discerning subtle differences in the shapes (featural information) and relative positions (configural information) of facial features. When recognizing faces, most humans consistently land their first fixation on the face just below the eyes (upper lookers), but some individuals fixate closer to the mouth (lower lookers). Do differences in long-term eye movement strategies influence the ability to process featural and configural facial information? To investigate this, we tested face recognition in upper and lower lookers using specially designed face stimuli that isolated variation in featural or configural information across exemplars, while fixating either at the eye or mouth regions. We found that upper lookers had superior recognition for configural faces than lower lookers, especially when fixating on the eyes. Using single-feature faces, we found that the upper lookers’ advantage arises from efficient extraction of configural face information from the eye region.",

          "abstract": "Emotion recognition is a fundamental aspect of social communication, yet most research has focused on visual emotion expressions, leaving less understood how auditory and audiovisual cues shape perceptual organization. The present study used representational similarity analysis (RSA) to examine how the structure of emotion recognition differs across modalities. Participants completed an emotion recognition task involving 14 emotions presented in auditory, visual, and audiovisual formats. Confusion matrices were computed for each modality and converted into representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs). Hierarchical clustering was applied to RDMs using silhouette-based cutoffs to identify emotion clusters. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) was also conducted on confusion profiles to provide two-dimensional visualizations of emotion space. Results revealed that audiovisual recognition produced the highest degree of distinctness, with most emotions forming singleton clusters and only a few small groupings. Visual recognition showed more cohesive clusters organized largely by valence. In contrast, auditory recognition yielded the broadest multi-emotion groupings, where vocal cues blurred categorical boundaries and produced clusters that combined positive and negative states. Together, these findings demonstrate that the perceptual organization of emotion recognition varies by modality. Audiovisual cues enhanced distinctiveness, visual cues reinforced valence-based structure, and auditory cues fostered broader clusters across valence boundaries. By integrating RSA and MDS, this study highlights the importance of moving beyond accuracy to examine the representational structure of emotion perception across sensory modalities.",

          "abstract": "As the world globalizes, a greater volume of cross-cultural interactions produces more opportunities for cultural transmission across group lines. How do psychological processes shape this transmission of cultural information between groups? We examine how people’s perceptions of other nations shape their willingness to transmit cultural information from individuals in that nation to others within their own nation. Drawing on theories of prestige-based cultural transmission, we tested whether people were more likely to transmit cultural information from individuals whose countries are perceived as internationally influential. We also tested whether this effect was shaped by two theoretically motivated moderators: the domain of information shared by a model (instrumental vs. value-oriented), and perceived competition with the model’s country. Across four studies using correlational (Study 1) and experimental (Studies 2-4) methods, and across samples from both the United States and New Zealand (Study 4), we found consistent evidence that international influence increases transmission of instrumental—but not value-oriented—cultural information across national borders. The role of competition is less consistent, sometimes moderating the effect of influence (Study 1), sometimes independently increasing transmission of instrumental—but not value-oriented—cultural information (Studies 3 &amp; 4), and varying across countries (Study 4). Together, these results suggest that psychological processes may support the transmission of norms from globally influential nations, but that this effect may be critically bounded by the type of cultural information in question, with implications for how cultural norms, practices, and traditions may flow across borders and ultimately shape large-scale cultural change.",

          "abstract": "We studied the perception of 16th- and 17th-century narrative paintings in three distinct groups: Deaf Sign Language users (ÖGS), Art History Experts, and Lay viewers. By combining eye-tracking data with open interviews, we aimed to test whether Deaf signers and art Experts would exhibit similar viewing behaviors due to their enhanced visual skills. We found that, despite lacking formal training in art history, Deaf viewers displayed oculometric patterns closely resembling those of Experts. These included shorter fixation durations, broader exploration of the pictorial surface, and increased attention to semantically meaningful elements such as symbolic objects and codified hand gestures. Both Deaf participants and Experts also used more concrete and detailed language to describe the paintings, in contrast to Lay viewers, who tended to offer more general and vague statements. Additionally, Deaf participants exhibited a distinctive pattern when viewing faces, focusing more on the mouth area than the eyes, likely due to visual habits of speech perception. These findings suggest a perceptual overlap between two populations with distinct cultural backgrounds and sensory experiences. Sign language mastery and early deafness may enhance visual perception and image interpretation. The results have broader implications for cognitive science, art history, and Deaf studies, demonstrating the value of cross-domain expertise in understanding human perception. They also support the inclusion of Deaf individuals in art history and museum careers, aligning with the concept of Deaf Gain.",

During fMRI, participants completed blocks of cued idiographic RT followed by a validated sustained attention task. Thought probes assessed momentary RT regulatory success. Study design, hypotheses, and analyses were preregistered (https://osf.io/qy4df). More difficulty disengaging from RT corresponded to worse task performance (slower responding with no increase in accuracy); reduced activity in salience, ventral, and dorsal attention networks; and reduced connectivity between DMN and dorsal attention network; but not reduced activity or connectivity of DMN.

          "abstract": "Pointing gestures are among the most common hand signs in early modern painting. Art historians have long assumed that they directly guide the viewer’s gaze towards key elements. However, this assumption has never been tested empirically. To investigate how depicted pointing gestures influence eye movements, we digitally removed the pointed forefingers from 15 paintings (16th-17th cent.) and compared the perception of these edited versions with the originals. Our results challenge traditional assumptions. While pointing fingers attract few direct fixations, their fleeting perception significantly reshapes how other elements are viewed. Semantically related areas – such as the targets of pointing gestures and the faces of pointing characters – receive increased direct attention. Also, pointing characters play a stronger role in saccadic transitions between areas of interest. Finally, our novel AOI dwell time correlation method reveals that viewers establish different semantic connections between characters and objects when pointing gestures are present. In the second phase of the study, open-ended interviews revealed that interpretations of the original paintings differ from those of the edited versions. These results underscore the central role of depicted pointing gestures. Rather than merely directing the viewer’s attention from one point to another, as art theoreticians had assumed, they reshape the narrative connections between elements, ultimately leading to different interpretations. Among all the artworks we analyzed, Caravaggio’s and Raphael’s compositions were the most affected by the removal of pointing gestures. This confirms that the effectiveness of pointing gestures in art also depends on individual artistic approaches and the artist’s mastery in guiding the viewer’s attention.",

          "abstract": "It is commonly assumed that people can use advance cues to proactively prepare for conflict from distracting stimulus features, yet empirical findings remain inconsistent. We hypothesized that that nature of stimulus-response (SR) mappings may be a key determinant of cue effectiveness, as vocal Stroop tasks (with non-arbitrary color-naming responses) have shown reliable cue benefits while manual Stroop tasks (with arbitrary key-press responses) typically have not. Across five experiments, we tested this hypothesis by using a spatial Stroop task with non-arbitrary SR mappings, where participants responded to the direction of arrow stimuli using spatially corresponding keys, while trying to ignore the spatially congruent or incongruent location of the stimuli. Despite robust congruency effects and optimal preparation conditions (100% valid cues, 2000ms preparation time), we observed no cue benefits in four experiments. Only when task difficulty was increased substantially (50ms stimulus presentation, Experiment 4) did cue benefits emerge, but exclusively for congruent trials. These findings document that non-arbitrary SR mappings are not a sufficient condition for ensuring cue-based engagement of proactive control, and suggest that cost-benefit calculations about control exertion may be a more promising candidate factor.",

Our clarified IST posits private self-awareness, public self-awareness, and identification with claim as moderators of identity shift, with private and public self-awareness influenced by identifiability and perceived publicness, respectively. Across two studies (n1 = 203; n2 = 780), we provide a near-comprehensive test of the clarified IST, conducting the first empirical test of several key mechanisms in the context of identity shift. Identifiability did not influence private self-awareness and perceived publicness did not influence public self-awareness. Identification with claim, but not private or public self-awareness, consistently moderated identity shift. We conclude by arguing that these findings suggest a possible reorientation of identity shift scholarship away from identifiability and publicness—central to early identity shift theorizing and IST—and toward biased scanning—central to early identity shift theorizing but dropped from IST.",

          "abstract": "A central challenge in cognitive science is to distinguish between multiple processes that can result in similar behaviours. In reinforcement learning (RL), one prominent example concerns two potential drivers of choice repetition: (i) a confirmation-bias learning asymmetry, in which agents learn more from outcomes that confirm their choices, and (ii) choice perseveration, an outcome-independent tendency to repeat past choices. Evidence for asymmetric learning has typically relied on computational models that control for perseveration, or specific behavioural markers designed to reveal asymmetric learning. Here, we show both these approaches have critical flaws and can spuriously detect learning asymmetries even in perseverative, symmetric-learning agents. To address this, we introduce a novel statistical test that distinguishes genuine learning asymmetries from spurious effects. Applying this test to a large dataset spanning ten published experiments, we find that some previously reported confirmation biases are fragile, albeit others remain robust even at a meta-analytic level. Finally, we propose a new task design that can yield a more valid qualitative signature of confirmation bias. We suggest our approach provides a reliable framework for disentangling processes underlying choice repetition, while providing tools for the wider research community that can minimize potential spurious effects arising from process mimicry and biased parameter estimation.",

          "abstract": "In order to maximize reward, humans need to balance engaging with currently available sources of reward and searching for better ones. Optimal foraging theory provides a formal but simple mathematical choice rule to make such stay/leave decisions, contrasting expected and experienced rewards. However, this rule (given by the Marginal Value Theorem; MVT) describes a strategy that does not consider the structure of the environment. In other words, it does not leave room for planning during foraging. Yet, the real world is replete with such opportunities. Therefore, we developed a new structured foraging task to study how people employ goal-directed planning during foraging. Specifically, we explore the extent to which participants incorporate an internal model of the task structure during stay/leave decisions. We find that behavior in this task follows the basic principles of the MVT, but that its structure invites people to also consider the value of alternative reward options when deciding to leave their current one. Importantly, this behavior is pronounced in more goal-directed participants. Computational modeling suggests that incorporating this alternative information is beneficial, but to an extent dictated by choice stochasticity. This study provides a novel method for studying decision making in structured environments, and has implications for understanding how foraging and planning interact.",

          "abstract": "Studying metacognition, the introspection of one’s own decisions, can provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the decisions. Here we show that observers’ uncertainty about their decisions incorporates both the entropy of the stimuli and the entropy of their response probabilities across the psychometric function. Describing uncertainty data with a functional form permits the measurement of internal parameters not measurable from the decision responses alone. To test and demonstrate the utility of this novel model, we measured uncertainty in 11 participants as they judged the relative contrast appearance of two stimuli in several experiments employing explicit bias or attentional cues. The entropy model enabled an otherwise intractable quantitative analysis of participants’ uncertainty, which in one case distinguished two comparative judgments that produced nearly identical psychometric functions. In contrast, comparative and equality judgments with different behavioral reports, yielded uncertainty reports that were not significantly different. The entropy model was able to successfully account for uncertainty in these two different types of decisions that resulted in differently shaped psychometric functions, and the entropy contribution from the stimuli, which were identical across experiments, was consistent. An observer’s uncertainty could therefore be measured as the total entropy of the inputs and outputs of the stimulus-response system, i.e. the entropy of the stimuli plus the entropy of the observer’s responses.",

          "abstract": "Chuyin et al. (2022) developed a novel free report paradigm and found that participants were able to report specific descriptions of natural scenes after briefly seeing them (with backward masking). Hirschhorn and Mudrik (2024) tried to replicate the study and proposed four challenges towards the paradigm, questioning its validity. However, due to a key methodological difference, their experiments can only be seen as partial replications of the original study. Here, we reply to all the challenges by Hirschhorn and Mudrik. Furthermore, we discuss issues that go beyond these original studies and that are critical for the consciousness science at large. In particular, we review controversial concepts, including gist and richness. Most importantly, we argue that participants’ reports about their experience should not be rejected by experimenters’ expectations about their experience, which is a fundamental issue in consciousness research. Instead of the (researchers’ expected) veridicality of experiences, focus should be put more on the “what-it-is-like” to be a participant. We also highlight that our free-report paradigm is designed to quantify the specificity of reported words rather than richness. Finally, we show that freely descriptive words reflect participants’ conscious perception. A set of 5 response words is enough to specify the presented image to the degree that is way above the chance.",

          "abstract": "Consider the sentence Oliver said that Samuel washed [him vs himself]. How do English speaking adults and children know that him means Oliver; whereas himself means Samuel? Traditionally the answer has been determined by (possibly innate) grammatical ‘binding principle’ constraints. The present work instead tests the claim of functionalist-pragmatic accounts that interpretation is determined primarily by what the speaker most plausibly intends to convey. For example, by using the low-frequency, marked reflexive form himself, the speaker is highlighting that the entity affected by the action is – unusually – also the agent of that action. In a forced-choice sentence-completion paradigm (with accompanying animations), we examined whether adults’ (N = 60) and 6- to 7-year-olds’ (N = 60; M = 6;10) use of a reflexive (himself) versus a non-reflexive pronoun (him) is determined by functional-pragmatic constraints. In a baseline ‘agentive’ condition (e.g., Samuel brushed paint all over…) both adults and children rarely used him over their preferred choice of himself. But in a ‘stative’ condition where the PATIENT is NOT necessarily the AGENT (e.g., Samuel has paint all over…) both adults and children were significantly more likely to choose him. This raises the possibility that discourse-pragmatic constraints can explain phenomena traditionally attributed to syntactic binding principles.",

          "authors": "Matteo Visconti di Oleggio Castello; Fatma Deniz; Tom Dupré la Tour; Jack L. Gallant",
          "abstract": "One of the major goals of cognitive neuroscience is understanding how the brain represents information about its own internal states and about the external world. This goal can be addressed by creating encoding models that reveal the information represented explicitly in measured brain activity. Here we describe the Voxelwise Encoding Model (VEM) framework for creating encoding models with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The VEM framework provides several key advantages over traditional neuroimaging approaches. First, the VEM framework is applicable to most experimental designs, from classic factorial designs to complex naturalistic experiments such as movie watching or video games. This flexibility enables researchers to study brain function across multiple domains with the same analytical approach. Second, hypotheses about functional representations are defined and tested quantitatively by extracting feature spaces from experimental stimuli or tasks. These feature spaces quantify specific types of information potentially represented in brain activity and can range from simple human-derived labels to complex features generated by deep neural networks. If a feature space can be used to linearly predict brain activity, the brain is considered to explicitly represent features within that feature space. This prediction approach provides a systematic way to test hypotheses about functional representations. Third, the VEM framework implements robust data science methods to improve model estimation and minimize false positive results. Encoding models are estimated on a training set and validated on an independent test set. Testing in an independent dataset provides direct evidence that experimental findings generalize beyond the dataset used for model estimation. Finally, voxelwise encoding models can be created in each participant's native brain space without unnecessary information loss due to spatial averaging or template resampling required by conventional group analyses. This enables the VEM approach to reveal fine-grained functional organization in individual participants that might otherwise be ignored. In this article, we provide a comprehensive guide to the Voxelwise Encoding Model framework through all phases of research, from experimental design and data collection to the estimation and interpretation of voxelwise encoding models.",

          "abstract": "Background: Motivational impairment is a primary feature of major depressive disorder (MDD), yet the cognitive mechanisms underlying this deficit remain unclear. Effort-cost decision making (decisions regarding whether outcomes are worth the effort required to obtain them) is a popular framework for understanding motivation in MDD. This study examined whether ECDM deficits in MDD are driven by 1) reduced reward sensitivity, 2) increased effort sensitivity, or 3) both. \n\nMethod: Individuals with MDD (N=32) and healthy controls (HC, N=30) completed the Apple Gathering Task. Participants decided whether an amount of effort (handgrip squeeze) was worth a reward (points). Reward and effort were parametrically manipulated to independently estimate effects of effort and reward. \n\nResults: Compared to HC, individuals with MDD were less willing to accept offers with low reward and low expected value (high effort requirements and low reward). Computational analyses using a Hierarchical drift diffusion modeling (DDM) mirrored these findings, suggesting that evidence accumulation in MDD compared to HC was 1) faster when rejecting high effort options, 2) slower when accepting high reward options. Additionally, higher fatigue was associated with reduced ECDM in those with MDD, particularly for offers with high effort and low expected value.\n\nConclusion: Our results provide support that reduced ECDM in MDD reflects both diminished reward valuation and heightened effort valuation. Further, we found that fatigue severity was associated with reduced ECDM. These results contribute to a growing body of evidence showing reduced ECDM in MDD and identifies the role that fatigue has in shaping these impairments.",

          "abstract": "Functional neurological disorder (FND) is characterised by involuntary, distressing neurological symptoms that are distinguishable from other neurological diagnoses in presentation, aetiology and mechanisms. Significant disability, impaired quality-of-life, and substantial healthcare resource utilisation often results from the disorder, yet its underlying mechanisms have not been proven empirically. Importantly, long-term clinical trajectories and predictive markers have been understudied in FND cohorts. Inadequate funding of large-scale mechanistic and longitudinal research, methodological limitations, and the absence of standardised outcome measures, necessitate development of innovative solutions. Digital remote monitoring technologies (dRMTs), which have been shown to be valuable across a range of other neurological and psychiatric disorders, may have unparalleled potential to address these research challenges in FND, yet this potential is currently unrealised. We propose that dRMTs could be harnessed to monitor subjective and/or objective functional neurological and associated symptoms, mechanistic variables, and important outcome domains, with excellent temporal precision, flexibility, and external validity. These methods could allow precise characterisation of both short- and long-term fluctuations in FND symptoms, the influences on them, and their impact on patients. Such data would strengthen mechanistic models, improve outcome prediction, and facilitate personalised FND clinical management in this underserved population.",

          "abstract": "Yearning is hallmark of grief and prolonged grief, but its psychological underpinnings are poorly understood. We aimed to address this by building on the phenomenological similarities with craving and investigating the role of desire thinking, a voluntary cognitive process central to activating craving. A community sample of bereaved adults (N = 676) completed the Oxford Grief Desire Thinking Scale (OG-DT). Psychometric validity of the two-factor solution (imaginal reunion, elaborative efforts) was excellent. Another three-wave longitudinal sample (N = 275) completed the OG-DT and measures of yearning and proximity-seeking at 0–6 months after loss as well as 6 and 12 months later. Yearning mediated the relationship between both imaginal reunion and elaborative efforts and proximity-seeking behaviors. These findings suggest that desire thinking may be a cognitive driver of yearning, which in turn motivates efforts to cope with the desire. Thus, desire thinking could present a new modifiable target for intervention.",

Incels—an online community of involuntary celibates—have been identified as needing mental health intervention. Despite high rates of depression, suicidality, and social isolation, little is formally known about their therapy experiences or attitudes. \n\nMethods: We conducted qualitative discourse analysis of 100 psychotherapy discussion threads from incels.is, the largest incel forum. We coded experiences of 89 users who reported attending therapy, analyzing therapist gender, motivation, and satisfaction. Inductive thematic analysis identified community attitudes toward psychotherapy.\n\nResults: Among incels reporting therapy experiences, 70.8% reported negative outcomes whereas only 7.9% reported satisfaction. None of those forced into therapy (25.8%) reported positive outcomes. Preliminary analysis suggested higher satisfaction with male therapists (16.7% vs. 7.1% for female). Thematic analysis revealed barriers to therapeutic engagement: (1) \"blackpill\" ideology attributing sexual/romantic deprivation and associated mental health issues to immutable factors; (2) conspiracy theories framing therapy as designed to sedate and control; (3) view of therapy as female-biased and hostile to men; (4) practical concerns including cost, privacy fears, and hospitalization.\n\nConclusions: Incels present intervention challenges due to their fatalistic worldview, institutional distrust, and extreme misogyny. Findings suggest potential benefits of male therapists and clearly defined therapeutic goals that acknowledge but do not promise to resolve romantic concerns",

A sample of 530 adults completed the SD4 and HEXACO-100 along with an open-ended creative humor production task, and their humor responses were coded for toxic content using Detoxify, a BERT-based large language model that had been fine-tuned to detect offensive material in text. Structural equation models found that the creation of vulgar humor was significantly associated with being male, younger, and less educated. None of the six HEXACO traits significantly predicted vulgarity, but Dark Tetrad models found significant effects for sadism (more vulgarity), psychopathy (less vulgarity), and the global D factor (more vulgarity) in a bifactor model. Taken together, the findings shed light on who is more likely to use taboo comedic devices and to create jokes that violate norms of politeness.",

          "abstract": "Frustration is a universally experienced yet understudied emotional state, frequently examined in isolated, controlled laboratory environments that neglect the intricate interaction of internal and situational factors. This exploratory research extends beyond such isolated settings by investigating how individual differences, including personality traits, behavioral tendencies, and situational triggers, influence the onset, severity, and reactions to frustration. A total of 145 participants (100 women), aged between 14 and 66 years, completed the Frustration Induction Task (FIT), which was designed to elicit frustration through factors such as time constraints, disruptive notifications, ambiguous feedback, and keyboard manipulation. Based on participants' self-reported experiences of frustration, three distinct response profiles were identified: High Frustration, Mid Frustration, and Low Frustration. The findings suggest that individuals exhibiting high levels of neuroticism, emotional dysregulation, and discomfort intolerance are more predisposed to the High Frustration profile. Conversely, higher emotional intelligence and robust personal standards of perfectionism serve as protective factors against frustration. Situational triggers, particularly time pressure, notably intensify frustration responses, especially among individuals with low impulse control and low discomfort tolerance. These results provide a more comprehensive understanding of individual differences in frustration responses and emphasize the importance of developing tailored emotion regulation strategies in both clinical settings and high-stress environments.",

          "abstract": "Introduction Cervical cancer is the first cancer potentially eliminable through widespread HPV vaccination. In Italy, despite free access, vaccine coverage among adolescents remains low. Psychological factors and cognitive biases can influence vaccine decisions and contribute to vaccine hesitancy (VH). While social media offer new avenues for health communication, their effectiveness in reducing VH is uncertain. This study investigates the impact of Instagram-based communication strategies on adolescents’ HPV knowledge and VH.\n\nMethods A three-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted in 22 high school classes in Tuscany, Italy, involving 526 students. Classes were assigned to one of three Instagram accounts: a neutral control, an information-based, or a bias-aware information. After three weeks (T2), students completed a follow-up survey, followed by an in-class lesson. Surveys were administered at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2), and three-month follow-up (T3).\n\nResults The final analysis included 301 students (mean age 15.2, 74% female). At T1, VH and knowledge scores were low (mean VH = 40%; knowledge score = 27%), and 47.9% reported likely seeking information from sexual and reproductive services. No significant changes in VH or knowledge were found at T2 overall. However, in students with low information avoidance (IA), the info-based page reduced VH significantly compared to the control (-6.9%, p = 0.009). In contrast, among high-IA students, the same intervention increased VH (estimate: +8.9%, p = 0.002). Willingness to seek information increased in the info group among low-IA students (+1.639 vs. control, p = 0.034). At T3, we measured the impact of an in-person lecture on students’ HPV and HPV vaccination literacy. A significant increase of knowledge compared to T1 is observed despite the smaller sample collected.\n\nConclusion Social media campaigns alone may not effectively reduce VH in adolescents and can even backfire among high-IA individuals. Future strategies should incorporate personalized, bias-aware messaging and interactive tools to address VH and improve HPV vaccine uptake more effectively.",

Similar to theists, non-theists in different cultures may share overarching narratives about morality and what it is founded upon – a possibility that remains to be systematically researched. In the present study, we utilised open-ended survey data to explore what non-religious non-theists from ten countries (N = 996) described as the basis of their views on right and wrong. We furthermore investigated how different beliefs about morality clustered together. The findings point towards cross-culturally recurring non-theistic beliefs and belief clusters pertaining to 1) important moral principles and 2) non-theistic ways to view the source of morality. We furthermore discuss country-specific findings, such as the importance of ‘conscience’ for Turkish and Czech participants and ‘cultural Christianity’ in the Danish sample. Altogether, the results support research indicating that a lack of belief in God does not entail moral relativism and question views on non-theists primarily seeing morality as self-constructed. Instead, our findings point towards a more prominent role of social interaction and ‘social contract’ in non-theistic views about right and wrong. We suggest that predominant ways of measurement in moral psychology may currently engulf the diversity of non-theistic moral outlooks and communal moralities in particular. To our knowledge, the study provides the first data-driven examination of non-theists’ views on right and wrong in different cultures.",

We understood that managing diabetes could be challenging, especially dealing with painful insulin injections and strict food rules. By talking with children and young people, we sought to learn more about their needs and what mattered most to them in terms of research. \nMethods: This study was conducted by Diabetes UK in collaboration with the University of East London to understand what children and young people with type 1 diabetes need to better take care of themselves. The study involved 21 participants aged 6 to 17 from England, Wales, and Scotland. We conducted focus groups with children and young people, as well as separate proxy focus groups with parents/guardians of the youngest research participants. The parent/guardian focus groups supplemented the evidence from the children’s focus groups, with the study prioritizing the voices of children and young people, to explore the challenges they faced in managing diabetes at home, school, and during leisure activities.\nResults: Our study revealed significant issues in diabetes management across different age groups: 6–8-year-olds prioritize research for managing glucose levels at home, and educating catering assistants about diabetes; 9–11-year-olds prioritize easier-to-change pumps, and educating friends about diabetes; 12–14-year-olds focus on educating teachers, creating safe spaces for managing hypoglycaemia, and raising awareness about sports and mood fluctuations; 15–17-year-olds seek to reduce the burden of educating others about diabetes in school.\nConclusions: This study is significant for future research and practice because it provides valuable insights that will guide future work in supporting children and young people with type 1 diabetes. By understanding their needs and priorities, we can develop strategies and policies that align with their lifestyles and expectations. This, in turn, will help them better manage their condition, reduce the risk of health crises, and improve their overall well-being as they grow older with diabetes.",

Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), participants performed a vowel categorization task under a subtle lip perturbation. Classifiers trained to decode perceived phonetic categories from single-trial brain responses showed significantly reduced accuracy when tested on perturbed trials, indicating that sensorimotor representations support phonetic categorization in a state-dependent manner. Regions with highest contribution to decoding accuracy, including auditory and speech motor areas, showed the greatest perturbation-related disruption. Sensorimotor activity also revealed marked individual differences: participants clustered into two subgroups, one showing perceptual shifts congruent with the lip posture and the other showing opposite shifts. By linking neural activity patterns to perceptual outcomes, our findings demonstrate that articulatory representations engaged during speech perception contribute functionally to phonetic processing and help explain individual variability in sensitivity to articulatory inputs.",

We measured the competition rates of participants in each condition of the prisoner’s dilemma games and their performance on social cognition (hostile attribution bias and empathy) and psychological measures [depression, (social) anxiety, impulsivity, interpersonal difficulties]. We assessed their relapse 6-months post detoxification.\nResults: Patients with SAUD displayed a competitive bias during the games (resulting in higher outcomes) and a less efficient adaptation to their opponent’s strategy. Patient and control groups were equally sensitive to the type of opponent (computer vs. human beings). We observed no link between the competitive bias of patients with SAUD and their social cognition difficulties. Critically, we observed that patients’ competitive bias was positively linked with relapse rates at six months follow-up. \nConclusions: SAUD is characterized by a competitive bias during social decision-making.",

Based on the predictive coding theory, we examined how different interpretive frameworks for the observer-self and virtual body relationship influence FBI strength. Sixty-six participants underwent a virtual reality FBI paradigm with synchronous/asynchronous visuo-tactile stimulation after being instructed to interpret the virtual body as either integrated with (integration condition) or separate from (separation condition) their physical body. Both groups received the fundamental instruction to “consider the virtual body as your own body.” Contrary to our hypothesis, no significant group × synchrony interaction emerged for either skin conductance responses or questionnaire measures, although exploratory analyses suggested potential group-specific patterns warranting future investigation. These findings suggest that fundamental ownership attributions dominate over conceptual distinctions, and that the precision of sensory evidence may outweigh subtle top-down modulations in body ownership, consistent with hierarchical predictive coding accounts of embodiment.",

          "authors": "Micol Iannuzzi; Glynis Bogaard; Jennifer Schell-Leugers",
          "abstract": "The rapid advancements of generative AI (GenAI) technologies have brought the issue of data manipulation to a whole new level. Now individuals can easily create highly realistic fabricated media, including videos, audio, and images, that are increasingly difficult to detect. These developments raise broad societal concerns, particularly in legal contexts, where authenticity of evidence is central to ensuring fairness. This review links documented legal cases to psychological research on memory distortion and false confessions to explore how AI-generated evidence affects individuals’ perception and sense of self and the consequences in a legal context. Decades of research have shown that memory’s vulnerability to suggestion, especially highlighting the power of personalized misinformation. Even in the pre-AI era, studies have shown how false memories have been induced using suggestion and simple media manipulations and how these have led to false confessions. GenAI adds another level of concern, yet no research directly examines its potential to distort memory and to elicit false confessions. This paper identifies urgent questions: How does AI-generated evidence impact memory? How can individuals ensure authenticity of the evidence confronting them? And how can legal systems prepare for the erosion of trust brought upon by this uncertainty? Proposed solutions like watermarking and implementation of authenticity protocols offer partial relief; however, the rapid advancements make sure that no definitive safeguards can be implemented. Understanding how GenAI interacts with our memory vulnerabilities is critical not only for legal psychology but for safeguarding the integrity of justice in today’s digitally mediated society.\n\nKeywords: Generative AI, deepfakes, memory distortion, legal psychology, false confessions, trust in evidence",

          "abstract": "Background:\nReading comprehension is critical for academic success, yet many children with persistent decoding difficulties struggle to achieve it. Although decoding typically becomes less constraining as reading develops, struggling readers may continue to face a decoding bottleneck into later primary years. Few randomised controlled trials have tested whether intervention-induced decoding gains translate into longer-term comprehension improvements. This study examined whether a multi-component literacy intervention can produce immediate and sustained benefits, and whether decoding gains mediate later comprehension outcomes.\nMethods:\nIn a randomised controlled trial, 285 English-speaking children aged 7–9 years with reading difficulties were assigned to a waitlist control group or the Research Informed Literacy with Language (RILL) intervention—a structured, multi-component programme targeting decoding and language comprehension. Literacy outcomes were assessed at baseline (t1), post-intervention (t2), and at four-month follow-up (t3). The trial was pre-registered (ISRCTN18940975).\nResults:\nChildren receiving RILL showed significantly greater gains in decoding (d = .19, p &lt; .001) and reading comprehension (d = .23, p = .011) immediately post-intervention. These effects were sustained four months later, with continued advantages for decoding (d = .17, p = .004) and comprehension (d = .25, p = .010). Notably, comprehension gains were stronger at follow-up than at post-test. Mediation analyses indicated a significant indirect effect of the intervention on comprehension at t3 via decoding at t2 (y-standardised indirect β = ..19, 95% CI [.13, .25], p &lt; .001); the direct effect was not significant (y-standardised β = .01, 95% CI [-.20, .20]).\nConclusions:\nThis is the first trial to show, in older struggling readers, that intervention-induced decoding gains mediate lasting improvements in reading comprehension. The findings highlight the persistence of decoding constraints in later primary years and show that strengthening word-level reading skills can produce enduring comprehension benefits.",

          "abstract": "Categorisation is a fundamental cognitive process, involving the integration of information across the senses. We investigated remotely using smartphones whether visual and tactile motion cues could enhance object category learning and generalisation to novel object shapes. Two categories of similar shapes were associated with specific correlated visual and tactile vibration motion cues. After learning object categories, participants were assessed on categorisation of learned and novel objects across four cue conditions: shape-only, shape-visual motion, shape-tactile motion, and shape-visual and tactile motion. We also assessed if accuracy was influenced by blocked versus interleaved cue-conditions at test. In Experiment 1, we found more accurate categorisation and generalisation when all cues were available at test. In Experiment 2 we replicated this effect even when the reliability of the shape-only cue for predicting category membership was reduced. In Experiment 3, we found that the absence of motion cues during learning removed the benefit of motion cues at test. Overall, our findings suggest that multisensory motion cues benefit the formation of novel object categories and allow for better generalisation. The results have implications for our understanding of the underlying dynamic and multisensory nature of object categories and the predictive role of multisensory features on category formation.",

Hungarian residents with online gambling history will be informed that they will have the chance to gamble real money on sports events. Following random allocation, half of the participants will be told that they will have the option to cash out their bets before the outcome of the sports event is known, while the other half will not. The study will compare the proportion of participants placing bets, bet sizes, and bet risks between the two groups. Furthermore, the study will explore the differential effects of the cash-out feature on specific high-risk subgroups.

          "abstract": "Frustration is a universally experienced yet understudied emotional state, frequently examined in isolated, controlled laboratory environments that neglect the intricate interaction of internal and situational factors. This exploratory research extends beyond such isolated settings by investigating how individual differences, including personality traits, behavioral tendencies, and situational triggers, influence the onset, severity, and reactions to frustration. A total of 145 participants (100 women), aged between 14 and 66 years, completed the Frustration Induction Task (FIT), which was designed to elicit frustration through factors such as time constraints, disruptive notifications, ambiguous feedback, and keyboard manipulation. Based on participants' self-reported experiences of frustration, three distinct response profiles were identified: High Frustration, Mid Frustration, and Low Frustration. The findings suggest that individuals exhibiting high levels of neuroticism, emotional dysregulation, and discomfort intolerance are more predisposed to the High Frustration profile. Conversely, higher emotional intelligence and robust personal standards of perfectionism serve as protective factors against frustration. Situational triggers, particularly time pressure, notably intensify frustration responses, especially among individuals with low impulse control and low discomfort tolerance. These results provide a more comprehensive understanding of individual differences in frustration responses and emphasize the importance of developing tailored emotion regulation strategies in both clinical settings and high-stress environments.",

          "abstract": "Life events have been theorized to elicit personality trait changes. However, the empirical evidence for event-related personality development remains inconclusive. Even comprehensive reviews and meta-analyses are limited by the availability of effect sizes, the control for relevant confounders, and the way time is treated in the analyses. To overcome these limitations, we conducted a coordinated data analysis and examined event-related personality changes across seven large-scale panel studies (Ntotal = 196,256). Furthermore, we investigated corresponding event-related changes in life satisfaction and self-esteem as benchmarks for the interpretation of effect sizes. Integrating the results across panel studies, we found several consistent changes in the Big Five personality traits in response to life events. For example, new employment predicted increases in conscientiousness and emotional stability, whereas marriage predicted a decrease in openness. However, event-related changes in the Big Five personality traits were small (average bstd = 0.06), with effect sizes similar to those of event-related changes in self-esteem but smaller than corresponding changes in life satisfaction. Building on these findings, future research should focus on the life events with replicable effects on personality development and examine how these life events lead to personality changes.",

However, the relevance of this phenomenon to clinical conditions, such as depression and eating disorders, is understudied. Therefore, we devised a questionnaire to measure hunger-related mood dysregulation.\nMethods\nWe developed and validated the Mood, Emotions and Appetite List (MEAL) using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis in adults and adolescents in the community, and adults with a history of mental health disorder (N = 1,119). We examined the association of MEAL scores with happiness, frustration and boredom during the frustration-inducing mood drift task, in which participants wait for six minutes and rate their mood every 30 seconds.\nResults\nThe MEAL showed good psychometric properties, capturing three factors for hunger-related ‘irritability’, ‘low mood’ and ‘somatic feelings’ (RMSEA = 0.03 in community adults, 0.05 in community adolescents, 0.08 in adults with mental health disorder history). Quantitative and qualitative responses evidenced that hunger-related mood dysregulation impacts relationships, work and other activities. MEAL scores were associated with irritability, depression, anxiety and menstrual symptoms. In the mood drift task, the irritability subscale (MEAL-i) demonstrated a significant interaction with time, such that individuals with higher MEAL-i scores reported steeper decreases in happiness (B = -0.11; 95% CI: -0.16–-0.06) and steeper increases in boredom (B = 0.06; 95% CI: 0.00–0.12) and frustration (B = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.05–0.19).\nConclusions\nThe MEAL measures individual differences in hunger-related mood dysregulation, is associated with mental health, self-reported functioning, and predicts faster worsening of mood during experimentally induced frustration.",

Our findings show no effects of daily adversity on selecting content with more or less semantic affinity, but exploratory analyses reveal that daily media coping strategies differentially relate to the selection of different entertainment genres.

          "abstract": "Frustration constitutes an affective state precipitated by the obstruction of goals or the failure to meet expectations, playing a crucial role in emotional regulation and the development of maladaptive behaviors. Despite its significance, frustration remains difficult to induce and quantify in experimental paradigms due to its multifaceted nature and overlap with related emotions such as anger, helplessness, and irritation. This study introduces the Frustration Induction Task (FIT), a tablet-based paradigm designed to evoke frustration in a controlled, reproducible, and component-specific manner. Across two experiments (total N = 160), participants were randomly assigned to complete a navigation task under either frustration-inducing or control conditions. The FIT integrated multiple triggers, including time constraints, ambiguous feedback, reward omission, keyboard manipulation, and interface disruptions, based on theoretical models of frustration. Participants reported their frustration after each trial and completed a post-task assessment of component-specific frustration. In Study One, the frustration-induced group reported significantly higher levels of frustration compared to the control group. Frustration levels increased progressively across trials, supporting the cumulative frustration design of the paradigm. In Study Two, time pressure, keyboard malfunction, and negative performance feedback emerged as the strongest contributors to frustration, whereas address familiarity played a minimal role. The FIT offers a paradigm for experimentally eliciting and measuring frustration. By enabling real-time, component-specific assessment of frustration dynamics, it provides a valuable framework for future research in affective science, cognitive control, neuroscience, and emotion regulation.",

The present study sought to address this gap via in-depth interviews with eight women who had been formally diagnosed with PCOS. Reflexive thematic analysis resulted in four themes: Symptoms of PCOS, Impact of PCOS, Diagnostic and Treatment Experiences, and Misogyny. We argue that service users are receiving inadequate information about PCOS from their clinicians due to the limited evidence base and lack of knowledge. We also highlight a need for increased awareness and acceptance of reproductive disorders more generally. Further research is needed to ensure that those with PCOS are adequately informed and supported in a holistic manner.",

However, these often require effort and people avoid effort. It is vital to identify psychological interventions that increase willingness to exert effort. 3,055 people from six diverse countries completed an effort-based decision-making task (Pro-Environmental Effort Task; Bulgaria: n=404, Greece: n=85, Nigeria: n=660, Sweden: n=1090, UK: n=482, USA: n=334). Participants chose whether to exert physical effort (50-95% of their maximum) to reduce carbon emissions, after experiencing one of 11 expert crowd-sourced interventions or no intervention. We applied computational modelling to precisely quantify motivation to help the climate, compared to a closely matched non-environmental cause. We found two interventions, which reduced the psychological distance to climate change impacts or promoted climate action as patriotic and protecting participants’ way of life, had consistent positive effects on increasing effortful pro-environmental behaviours, across measures and control analyses. At the individual level, motivation to benefit the climate was associated with belief in climate change and support for pro-environmental policies. In contrast, trait apathy and effort aversion were linked with reduced motivation to benefit both the climate and food cause. Together, our results have crucial implications for promoting effortful actions that help mitigate climate change.",

          "abstract": "Emotional experience and the regulation thereof are typically studied using picture inventories or short films to induce and modify affective states. These approaches, however, lack ecological validity due to their passive and receptive nature. Recent innovations in virtual reality and mobile neurophysiological technologies have enabled researchers to study the behavioral and neural correlates of more ecologically valid emotional responses. In this preregistered study, 58 healthy participants were randomly assigned to either use cognitive reappraisal (intervention) or to immerse themselves in their senses and surroundings (control) while walking across a wooden plank suspended 80 stories above the ground in virtual reality. We measured behavioral ratings, salivary alpha amylase and cortisol levels, as well as frontal brain asymmetries, captured using mobile electroencephalography (EEG). Across both conditions, we found decisive evidence of increased subjective fear and salivary alpha amylase, a marker of sympathetic activation. However, we found no increase in cortisol levels following the task suggesting that subjective fear alone is not sufficient to trigger an HPA-axis response. In contrast to our hypotheses, the reappraisal group did not show any difference compared to the control group for neither behavioral, endocrine nor neural measures. On the one hand, our findings may suggest that reappraisal might not be a suitable strategy to regulate realistic and intensely frightening situations. On the other hand, further analyses also indicated that the control group may have also regulated their emotions due to increased mindfulness of their inner states and their environment. Future studies are needed to confirm these observations and ascertain the efficacy of cognitive reappraisal on fear in realistic settings.",

These children and their families may greatly benefit from targeted interventions that facilitate the disruption of accumulating vulnerability. To facilitate these efforts, we need empirical evidence of the underlying dynamics of adversity and health problems throughout childhood.\n\nMethods\n\nWe investigated associations between three types of childhood adversities (material deprivation, experiences of loss or threat of loss and family dynamics) and hospitalizations for mental and physical health problems across four developmental periods among 12,446 children who experienced high rates of family adversity. We used data from the Danish Life Course (DANLIFE) register-based cohort study and applied cross-lagged networks models. Hospitalizations were identified through inpatient, outpatient, and emergency hospital contacts.\n\nResults\n\nWe found clear evidence for the co-occurrence of childhood adversities and health problems across childhood, partially resulting from feedback loops and direct effects between different types of childhood adversities, and between physical and mental health problems. We also observed strong autoregressive effects across childhood adversity and health domains indicating vicious circles of reinforcing adversity. Conditional on high health problems in infancy, childhood adversity was not found to be associated with additional health problems throughout the rest of childhood. Child health problems were, however, positively associated with subsequent adversity across childhood. \n\nConclusions\n\nDynamics of childhood adversity and poor health give rise to complex reinforcing patterns of vulnerability over time.

          "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that individual differences in difficulties finding a romantic partner are associated with sexism and belief in sexism shift. We hypothesized that, because heterosexual men with low (vs. high) mate value and low (vs. high) mate access face greater difficulties in finding a partner, they are more likely to hold sexist beliefs. We used self-reports of mate value, mate access, hostile sexism, benevolent sexism, and belief in sexism shift from 1,604 Finnish adults. We examined associations between these self-reports by using multivariate multiple regression, controlling for political ideology, sex ratio, and whether the respondent was searching for a partner. Higher mate value was associated with more benevolent sexism in women, but not in men. Contrary to predictions, frequent mate access encounters were associated with lower benevolent sexism in women, but not in men. We did not find associations between mate value or mate access and hostile sexism or belief in sexism shift in men or women. The findings highlight the role of male gender and political conservatism in predicting sexist beliefs, as men and politically conservative respondents reported more benevolent and hostile sexism and belief in sexism shift than women and politically liberal respondents.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence is a period of heightened sensation-seeking, risk-taking, and reward sensitivity, characterized by structural and functional changes in the brain. Developmental changes in functional connectivity between cortical and subcortical regions may refine communication within reward-related circuitry, influencing learning and decision-making. Here, we compared reinforcement learning behavior and its relationship to resting-state functional connectivity in reward-related circuits in adolescents and adults. Fifty-eight healthy participants (32 adolescents aged 13-16; 26 adults aged 30-40) completed a probabilistic two-armed bandit task and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The learning-related parameters learning rate (α) and inverse temperature (β, an index of the randomness of choices) and their relationship to functional connectivity were modeled from behavioral data using Q learning in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. In the whole sample, learning rate was associated with functional connectivity in several cortico-subcortical pathways, particularly involving the anterior cingulate cortex. Adolescents exhibited lower learning rate and inverse temperature values than adults and had a stronger association between learning rate and fronto-striatal connectivity. Adolescents also showed less tendency to stay with winning options. These findings highlight the involvement of the ACC in reward learning and indicate that behavior in a reinforcement learning context is characterized by reduced feedback-driven learning and greater exploration in adolescents compared to adults, and suggest that adolescents rely more on fronto-striatal connectivity during learning.",

We designed an interactive immersive-reality experiment, where participants—either alone or in groups of five—foraged for rewards in environments with different resource distributions. Our behavioral results revealed that groups outperformed solitary foragers and even optimal Bayesian agents in environments with sparse rewards but large differences in patch quality—precisely as predicted by our numerical simulations from both frameworks. Computational analyses showed that reinforcement-learning and drift-diffusion models generated similar behav-\nioral predictions, with both frameworks accurately reproducing participants’ behavior across conditions. However, at the cognitive level, both frameworks partly diverged in explaining the process of social information integration, overall suggesting that participants integrated the choices and payoffs of others into their personal evaluation of the environment. This study deepens our understanding of social decision-making processes in naturalistic collectives and emphasizes the importance of cross-framework comparisons.",

This study presents a systemic analysis of children's speech, using low-dimensional embeddings to examine how the contextual knowledge reflected in their utterances reorganizes as linguistic experience increases. Our results suggest that the order and position of words in sequences produced by children from different age groups reflect changes in the way they represent categories of words. Rather than being ungrammatical, children's utterances appear to be structured by temporary grammars, which optimize the distribution of information in sequences. We show how semantic networks reorganize to support learning and suggest that English provides functionally ambiguous (multipurpose) categories to aid the reorganization of semantic spaces. These findings are somewhat counterintuitive, as they suggest that not knowing the exact meaning of words can facilitate both learning and communication.",

We fit a continuous time model to five factor model (FFM) personality trait facets that parsed general correlated change and change that could be accounted for by FFM domains using ten years of longitudinal data from the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality disorders Study (N = 733). We found that the general change factor was very similar to lay and expert conceptions of psychological health and explained more variance in personality disorder symptom reductions over time than trait change factors. These results support the distinction between PF and personality traits, suggest that features of PF can be identified within change processes in personality trait assessments, and highlight the importance of designs that are sensitive to theoretical differences in these concepts.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, social media has become increasingly fragmented, as platforms evolve and new alternatives emerge. Yet most research studies a single platform—typically Twitter/X, or occasionally Facebook—leaving little known about the broader social media landscape. Here we shed new light on patterns of cross-platform variation in the high-stakes context of news sharing. We examine the relationship between user engagement and news domains’ political orientation and quality across seven platforms: Twitter/X, BlueSky, TruthSocial, Gab, GETTR, Mastodon, and LinkedIn. Using an exhaustive sampling strategy, we analyze all (over 10 million) posts containing links to news domains shared on these platforms during January 2024. We find that the news shared on platforms with more conservative user bases is significantly lower quality on average. Turning to patterns of engagement, we find—contrary to hypotheses of a consistent “right wing advantage” on social media—that the relationship between political lean and engagement is strongly heterogeneous across platforms. Conservative new posts receive more engagement on platforms where most content is conservative, and vice versa for liberal news posts,  consistent with an “echo platform” perspective. In contrast, the relationship between news quality and engagement is strikingly consistent: across all platforms examined, lower-quality news posts received higher average engagement even though higher quality news is substantially more prevalent and garners far more total engagement across posts. This pattern holds despite accounting for poster-level variation, and is observed even in the absence of ranking algorithms, suggesting user preferences – not algorithmic – bias may underlie the underperformance of higher-quality news.",

Efficiency signifies a peak level of performance that uses the least amount of inputs to achieve the highest amount of output. Academic efficiency can be external or internal. External efficiency is related to the private and social benefits derived from investment in education, while internal efficiency is concerned with achieving the institutional goals set by academic leaders, within the allocated resources.

Dynamical systems theory offers a transtheoretical framework for modeling how therapeutic microprocesses shift and stabilize, but few methods can quantitatively link features such as stable states (“attractors”) and shifts (“transitions”) with empirical data, especially when governing equations are unknown. We introduce Temporal Mapper, a topological data analysis (TDA) method that detects these features and represents their organization as attractor transition networks. As a proof-of-concept, we apply Temporal Mapper to psychotherapy microprocess data, examining interpersonal behaviors and alliance ruptures. The method revealed that therapist warmth stabilized dyadic states within and between sessions, whereas confrontation ruptures stabilized states within sessions but diversified and destabilized them across sessions. Beyond this example, Temporal Mapper offers a generalizable approach for uncovering fine-grained dynamic patterns in psychotherapy and identifying mechanisms of change to inform more effective interventions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Emotion regulation is a transdiagnostic factor in psychopathology. However, the field is primarily dominated by research in explicit emotion regulation. Understanding of implicit emotion regulation as well as its relationship with explicit emotion regulation is limited. Here, we investigate whether explicit and implicit emotion regulation exist on a continuum of the explicitness of the emotion regulation goal at the neural level.\n\nMethod: We conducted a coordinate-based neuroimaging meta-analysis with activation likelihood estimation. We focused on neuroimaging studies that investigate explicit (i.e., reappraisal, suppression, distraction, selective attention, psychological placebo) and implicit emotion regulation strategies (i.e., extinction, affect labelling, emotional go/no-go, emotional stroop) in either healthy individuals or individuals with mood and/or anxiety disorders.\n\nResults: There were more studies of explicit emotion regulation (75 experiments, 2811 participants) than implicit emotion regulation (28 experiments, 1292 participants). Results of the neuroimaging meta-analysis revealed that explicit emotion regulation strategies recruit more frontal and temporal lobe compared to implicit emotion regulation. Implicit emotion regulation strategies recruit more subcortical and limbic areas compared to explicit emotion regulation strategies. Insula, inferior frontal gyrus and extra-nuclear in the subcortical area are responsible for both explicit and implicit emotion regulation. \n\n\nConclusion: Explicit and implicit emotion regulation are associated with different neural correlates. Explicit emotion regulation recruits more regions responsible for goal-directed behaviors while implicit emotion regulation targets regions related to emotion and affect processing, instead of goal-awareness. \n\n\nPre-registration: This study was pre-registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024505144).",

These practices now need to be carefully evaluated for safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness. We aimed to investigate key data to inform future economic evaluations in this area via a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of the Australian population.\nMethods We compared quality-of-life scores across groups using regression analysis to account for group differences. Self-reported health service use (general, mental, complementary) was compared across groups (not needed, unmet need, used service) and index-scores. Self-reported practice cost estimates were investigated across contemplative practices (e.g. meditation, yoga) for a range of cost types (e.g. classes, travel, donations). \nResults The sample included 445 meditators, 1034 other contemplative practitioners and 586 non-practitioners, with large demographic differences between groups. Unadjusted quality-of-life was significantly higher for non-practitioners compared to practitioners. Differences were maintained when demographic variables were added to the model, but not when mental health service use was included as a covariate. We estimated that 8.9% of the sample had unmet mental-health service use and that this was highest in the meditation group (13.9%) compared to the non-practitioner group (2.4%). The average cost of any contemplative practice (including meditation) was $1,281 per person. \n \nConclusions This study provides preliminary evidence on potentially suitable variables for estimating costs and effects towards conducting cost-effectiveness studies of contemplative practices.

As a result, it remains underexplored how such internal experiences are preserved or transformed in naturalistic autobiographical recall, and whether they serve functional roles. To address this gap, we analyzed a large-scale dataset of autobiographical narratives in which crowdsourced participants recalled a specific memorable life event twice, several weeks apart, and rated their memories along multiple dimensions. We combined manual annotation with natural language processing to identify and analyze individual memory details, categorized as either observable external experiences or subjective internal experiences. We found that internal experiences were more prone to distortion or forgetting over time compared to external ones. However, those with higher emotional intensity and stronger semantic connections to external event\nfeatures were more likely to be retained. Memories richer in internal experiences were also judged as more important, and semantically precise reinstatement of internal experiences across recalls predicted increased importance over time. Together, these findings show that although memories of internal thoughts and feelings are relatively fragile, they nonetheless play a meaningful role in shaping the subjective significance of autobiographical memory.",

          "authors": "Michael L DeKay",
          "abstract": "People’s preferences in choices involving money, health, and other matters can often be steered toward safer or riskier options by framing the options as potential gains or potential losses. This risky-choice framing effect is well established, but its direction and magnitude depend on whether the options are described completely or incompletely and whether the descriptions are matched or mismatched in the gain and loss frames. In a recent experiment involving 18 combinations of option descriptions (nine in each frame), DeKay and Dou (2024) found that the valence or gist of the descriptions accounted for substantial variation in risk preferences, favoring categorical theories of framing over more mathematical theories. However, a residual framing effect and a framing effect in choices between completely described options contradicted the categorical theories and previous results. The effect for completely described options was especially surprising, but it was based on data from only 97 participants. The experiment reported here replicated all these effects in a large sample (N = 1,697) well-matched to U.S. Census data and with many more participants (477) making choices between completely described options. Risky-choice framing effects do stem partly from mismatched option descriptions, but a framing effect persists even when descriptions are matched and complete. The latter results expand the effect’s relevance to situations where it was thought to be absent. Among several theory specifications, a new rescaled version of the explicated valence account is the only one that explains these effects in the replication and in DeKay and Dou’s online and student samples.",

While stability supports the maintenance of a stable task focus and resistance against interference, cognitive flexibility facilitates adaptive responses to changing demands. In a pre-registered electroencephalography study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying adjustments in cognitive stability and flexibility by examining neural signatures of cognitive control adjustments. Specifically, we tested whether deliberate enhancements in cognitive stability and flexibility levels were associated with a facilitation of goal shielding and shifting, respectively. Participants completed a task-switching experiment in which they received explicit strategy instructions that aimed at promoting either cognitive stability or flexibility in a within-subjects design. We assessed mid-frontal theta power as an indicator of cognitive control recruitment and effort mobilization. Participants succeeded in adopting the instructed control states and behaviorally exhibited inverse adjustments in indicators of cognitive stability and flexibility. However, we did not find any differences in theta power in response to shielding or shifting demands between conditions. Consistent with previous studies and subjective effort ratings, more stable control states were further not associated with a generally increased recruitment of cognitive control. We thus did not find that adjustments in cognitive stability and flexibility were linked to modulations in effort or cognitive control recruitment. Potential processes that may have promoted more effective task shielding and shifting are discussed, providing directions for future research.",

The present study investigated two potential control modulators and tested whether reinforcement-based learning and explicit instructions can induce shifts in cognitive stability and flexibility. Furthermore, it aimed to contribute to the ongoing debate on whether cognitive stability and flexibility represent extreme points on a unidimensional continuum and therefore underlie an inherent tradeoff or rather depend on independent mechanisms. To this end, we conducted two online task-switching experiments. In Experiment 1, we examined whether selectively rewarding participants for stable or flexible behavior would promote the respective control states. In Experiment 2, we aimed to replicate previous findings of instruction-based control adaptations. We did not find coherent evidence for reinforcement- and instruction-based control adjustments. However, across both experiments, shifts in cognitive stability and flexibility were negatively correlated at the level of individual participants.

Context-dependent adjustments of cognitive stability and flexibility are a prerequisite for adaptive behavior. A current debate centers on whether these two functions of cognitive control involve a tradeoff, manifesting in reciprocal performance benefits and costs, or if cognitive stability and flexibility can be regulated independently. This study aimed to test the assumption of a stability-flexibility tradeoff and investigate determinants of control regulations. We examined whether cognitive stability and flexibility can be regulated voluntarily and whether these adjustments are modulated by the task relevance of distracting information. In two task-switching paradigms with varying distractor relevance, we instructed participants to either focus on the current task or to switch flexibly between tasks in within-subject designs. Monetary rewards were contingent on how well participants succeeded in implementing these instructions. Across both experiments, participants adjusted their cognitive flexibility but not stability according to the instructions. The distractor relevance further did not moderate control adjustments. Multilevel analyses revealed no correlations between changes in task-switch costs and interference costs in both experiments, providing no evidence for the expected tradeoff between cognitive stability and flexibility. Our results provide evidence that adjustments in cognitive flexibility are partly under voluntary control.

          "abstract": "Americans overestimate the extremity of differences between, and homogeneity among, the (non-political) characteristics and preferences of Republicans versus Democrats. We propose that everyday self-presentation contributes to these misperceptions: signaling motives lead people to represent themselves as more ``sorted'', i.e. as having preferences and characteristics that are closely aligned with what is perceived as typical of their party. This leads observers to have miscalibrated (and exaggerated) perceptions of differences between the groups. We present two studies testing the hypothesis that signaling motives exaggerate public expressions of partisan sortedness.  Study 1 examines how social media users' profile descriptions vary in sortedness across social media platforms using two multi-platform datasets (N=740,055; 10,224).  Study 2 (N=3,013) demonstrates a causal effect of signaling opportunities on sortedness using a pre-registered economic trust game experiment where participants write a self-description. We randomize whether this description will be shared with a co-partisan who is deciding how much to trust the participant.  Across both studies, we found that people present themselves as more sorted when returns to signaling in-party status are larger.  \nFurthermore, people perceive sortedness of fellow partisans as a signal of trustworthiness - and sortedness is indeed a signal of trustworthiness, but only in the absence of signaling motives. \nTogether, these findings shed light on how misperceptions of the extent of differences between political groups may be rooted in strategic self-presentation practices. This work has implications for disentangling performative and substantive polarization, and designing practical and effective depolarization interventions.",

          "abstract": "Individual learners often show a tendency to engage in self-reinforcing avoidance, a pattern referred to as a learning trap.  Across five experiments, we investigated the extent to which previously trapped learners can escape via social observational learning. While social observational learning did help a significant number of trapped learners escape, the majority of trapped learners remained trapped even after observing a partner demonstrate an optimal decision rule. Across several follow-up experiments, we unpack possible factors which limited the effectiveness of social observational learning. Overall, the results suggest that social decision rule inference (inferring a partner's decision rule from observed choices) was a key bottleneck for observational learning. Simulations show that these results were unanticipated by a leading model of social reward learning, and highlight a central role for inference in social learning.",

          "abstract": "Transcribing naturalistic caregiver-child interactions is a labor-intensive task in developmental research. While automatic speech recognition (ASR) models offer potential solutions, current ASR systems, including OpenAI’s Whisper, were primarily trained on adult-directed speech (ADS) and have not been systematically evaluated for infant-directed speech (IDS). IDS differs from ADS in prosody, phonetics, utterance structure, and lexical patterns, posing unique challenges for ASR transcription. In this study, we benchmarked Whisper’s transcription accuracy on a dataset of naturalistic caregiver infant recordings, comparing ASR-generated transcripts to human-annotated gold-standard transcriptions. We evaluated Whisper’s performance using word error rate (WER) and accuracy, and conducted a failure analysis to identify systematic errors made by Whisper, including utterance segmentation mismatches, high error rates in short and repetitive speech and inconsistent filler word handling. Results indicated that Whisper struggles with short, contextually ambiguous utterances and fails to reliably segment IDS utterances. Based on these results and early user experience, we propose a preliminary pipeline for integrating ASR technology with human transcription workflows to enhance the efficiency of processing large-scale naturalistic speech data in developmental research.",

          "abstract": "Humans are capable of sophisticated social reasoning. This capability is often attributed to a folk theory of mind, which rationally links inferences about the beliefs and desires of another person to their observed behavior through a form of inverse planning. Evidence suggests, however, that people do not consistently exercise this capability. One reason may be that theory of mind is computationally costly. Heuristic methods can circumvent some of these computations, particularly when reasoning about routine behavior. We explored the conditions under which people engage in full inference versus heuristic approximations. We found that participants selectively neglected the beliefs of other agents when inferences about these beliefs were not necessary for predicting behavior. This “belief neglect” appeared to be the default behavior; participants exhibited belief sensitivity only with training on a task where belief inference was necessary. These findings suggest that people are capable of adaptive cognitive resource allocation in social reasoning.",

          "abstract": "The production effect refers to the finding that words read aloud are remembered better than words read silently. Historically, this phenomenon has been explained with reference to distinctive features encoded at study (e.g., auditory and motor elements) being retrieved at test to discriminate between studied and unstudied items, with emphasis placed on features stemming from the act of production itself. Across two experiments, we demonstrate that even anticipation of reading a word aloud is sufficient to improve its memory over silent items. Using a recent variant of the production paradigm involving pupillometry, participants were instructed to withhold their response until a “Go” signal appeared. On “catch” trials this signal never occurred. Despite having not produced the word on a catch trial, participants nonetheless demonstrated both a behavioral (Experiments 1 and 2) and a pupillary (Experiment 2) production effect, although both were of lesser magnitude than on trials requiring actual production. For “Go” trials, the behavioral production effect was evident for both recollection and familiarity; for “catch” trials, the effect was evident only for recollection. These results support recent claims that motivational or attentional factors play a role in the emergence of the production effect, connecting this effect to a broader framework of action-oriented memory enhancement.",

We then demonstrate this through two empirical studies. Study 1 classifies thousands of crisis counseling conversations and Reddit posts into different types of mental health issues and introduces a novel method to evaluate text models for content validity —the extent to which a test captures the full range of expressions of a construct. Study 2 examines prospective criterion validity by estimating how 49 known suicide risk factors predict imminent risk in crisis counseling conversations.\n\nIn sum, NLP studies in psychology often rely on only a few validation metrics; here, we demonstrate the need for broader psychometric evaluation and provide a practical blueprint and future directions for achieving it.",

Here, we used fMRI and predictive modeling to investigate how multiple dynamic, personalized positive experiences are encoded in the brain. Neural representations and functional integration of brain areas during experiences of monetary reward, social media, music, and positive autobiographical memories were used to predict participants' affect ratings of each experience. We found that, across experiences, positive affect was encoded in multivariate neural patterns and functional coupling of distributed cortical and subcortical brain areas, as well as some canonical value-linked brain regions, like the orbitofrontal cortex. We also found that more restricted sets of brain representations and functional connections linked to sensory processing were involved in encoding type-specific subjective positive affect.

Like other forms of inference, mediation analyses are susceptible to false positive results. This is particularly true when analytic decisions are based on the data, rather than a priori hypotheses. To assess the collective evidential value of mediation analyses in marketing, we used an approach first implemented by Götz and colleagues (2021) that (1) measures the relative proximity of confidence intervals to zero (RP) and (2) aggregates a related set of RP scores into a single distribution. For our analysis, we compared the RP distribution of top marketing journals (2018-20) to simulations of low power, adequate power, and null effects. We also compared the marketing journals to real-world data from Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (JPSP) (2018-20). We found that, in terms of evidential value, mediation analyses in marketing substantially deviated from simulations of adequate power and JPSP but  were similar to simulations of low power and null effects.

However, these often require effort and people avoid effort. It is vital to identify psychological interventions that increase willingness to exert effort. 3,055 people from six diverse countries completed an effort-based decision-making task (Pro-Environmental Effort Task; Bulgaria: n=404, Greece: n=85, Nigeria: n=660, Sweden: n=1090, UK: n=482, USA: n=334). Participants chose whether to exert physical effort (50-95% of their maximum) to reduce carbon emissions, after experiencing one of 11 expert crowd-sourced interventions or no intervention. We applied computational modelling to precisely quantify motivation to help the climate, compared to a closely matched non-environmental cause. We found two interventions, which reduced the psychological distance to climate change impacts or promoted climate action as patriotic and protecting participants’ way of life, had consistent positive effects on increasing effortful pro-environmental behaviours, across measures and control analyses. At the individual level, motivation to benefit the climate was associated with belief in climate change and support for pro-environmental policies. In contrast, trait apathy and effort aversion were linked with reduced motivation to benefit both the climate and food cause. Together, our results have crucial implications for promoting effortful actions that help mitigate climate change.",

Specifically, he argues that individuals possess an inborn moral faculty responsible for the principled generation of moral intuitions. These moral intuitions, once sufficiently abstracted, generalized, and universalized by individuals, gave rise to the idea of human rights embodied in such conventions as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I am sympathetic to this argument. I thus take my comments on M&amp;R as an opportunity to preempt topical challenges to the mentalist theory arising in statistical machine learning. I make clear the foundations of mentalism (generativism) in language and morality. These foundations are used to argue against the use of computational models as theories of human cognition and to limit the scope of models as proxies for theories. Focuses include the format of the input to models, the sequence of learning trajectories, the constraints on learning, and the means of data collection. These arguments are tied back into M&amp;R’s core themes, in particular concerning the necessity of a rich descriptive account of morality and the theory-dependence of data-interpretation.",

This delay maybe caused by a variety of factors, including delayed access to language, and a lack of STEM learning resources available in American Sign Language (ASL). Current efforts to create STEM resources in ASL either emphasize connections to English using strategies like fingerspelling, or emphasize connections to concepts through signs that use visuospatial elements to depict the idea. Past research suggests that hearing students show improved learning when using gestures that clearly depict and embody STEM concepts. Our research investigated whether signed lessons that emphasized connections to English, or visuospatial concepts, would lead to increased learning and more embodied understanding of STEM topics. In Study 1, we developed and validated pairs of video lessons for four topics, using iterative feedback to create equally clear videos in two distinct signing styles: English-motivated (EM) and Concept-motivated (CM). In Study 2, we used these video lessons to compare within-participant learning from the two signing styles. Our results showed participants’ scores increased from pre- to post-test, indicating learning, but there were no differences based on signing style. However, when we examined participants’ signed summaries, we found that production of more CM signs was related to higher post-test scores, whereas the production of more EM signs was not. This result suggests the benefits from embodied learning occur when the signs are closely linked to the concept and that those benefits are maximized when learners produce the signs themselves.",

This view is taken to reflect the priority that people should place on moral pursuits or “moral primacy.” The results of four preregistered studies (N = 2,911) suggest that people do not always hold this view and highlight a tension within it: how can morality both constrain human behavior and afford the freedom to be one’s truest self? We find that people resolve this conflict with ‘value pluralism,’ preferring a balance of life pursuits across several value domains, where aesthetic pursuits are viewed as affording freedom from convention. We then adapt a personal change paradigm from prior work and develop a novel paradigm to examine whether people’s intuitions about the true self also reveal that a broader set of values—not just moral ones—inform judgments of the true self. We find no differences in true self judgments following the loss of an aesthetic versus moral quality. However, when directly comparing life paths, the pursuit of aesthetic excellence is sometimes viewed as offering greater access to one’s true self compared with moral excellence, in part because aesthetic pursuits are seen as less rule bound. These findings offer insights into the myriad paths a person can take in life while pursuing autonomy, authenticity, and closeness to their true self.",

Moving from the abstract to the concrete, the criteria and risk factors were examined with reference to current real-world examples of information disorders drawn from a variety of setting (e.g., academic research, advertising campaigns, cyberattacks, peer-to-peer corporate transactions, public weather warnings). One of the main challenges exposed through this process was evidencing impact (tangible losses, intangible losses). This, and other limitations that were revealed through real cases are discussed in the concluding section which stress the need for an incident database of information disorders.

Similar to theists, non-theists in different cultures may share overarching narratives about morality and what it is founded upon – a possibility that remains to be systematically researched. In the present study, we utilised open-ended survey data to explore what non-religious non-theists from ten countries (N = 996) described as the basis of their views on right and wrong. We furthermore investigated how different beliefs about morality clustered together. The findings point towards cross-culturally recurring non-theistic beliefs and belief clusters pertaining to 1) important moral principles and 2) non-theistic ways to view the source of morality. We furthermore discuss country-specific findings, such as the importance of ‘conscience’ for Turkish and Czech participants and ‘cultural Christianity’ in the Danish sample. Altogether, the results support research indicating that a lack of belief in God does not entail moral relativism and question views on non-theists primarily seeing morality as self-constructed. Instead, our findings point towards a more prominent role of social interaction and ‘social contract’ in non-theistic views about right and wrong. We suggest that predominant ways of measurement in moral psychology may currently engulf the diversity of non-theistic moral outlooks and communal moralities in particular. To our knowledge, the study provides the first data-driven examination of non-theists’ views on right and wrong in different cultures.",

Specifically, we discuss a) how estimates of PAT efficacy are confounded under functional unblinding and b) uncertainty surrounding whether subjective or neurobiological effects are causal therapeutic MOAs of PATs. We then review methodological solutions to address these challenges.\n\nRecent Findings: Several novel methodologies have been discussed in the literature. For testing PAT efficacy under functional unblinding, potential solutions include improved active placebo conditions, expectancy-focused recruitment and consent procedures, better measurement of expectancies and blinding, and more rigorous statistical modeling. For testing whether subjective effects are causal MOAs in PATs, strategies that disentangle the subjective and neurobiological effects of psychedelics are needed. Potential methods include administering psychedelics under general anesthesia, developing non-psychoactive psychedelic analogues, leveraging Mendelian randomization, and studying psychedelic microdosing. Participant safety and ethical considerations are critical for many of these strategies.

          "authors": "C. Huang; Tobias Egner",
          "abstract": "It is commonly assumed that people can use advance cues to proactively prepare for conflict from distracting stimulus features, yet empirical findings remain inconsistent. We hypothesized that that nature of stimulus-response (SR) mappings may be a key determinant of cue effectiveness, as vocal Stroop tasks (with non-arbitrary color-naming responses) have shown reliable cue benefits while manual Stroop tasks (with arbitrary key-press responses) typically have not. Across five experiments, we tested this hypothesis by using a spatial Stroop task with non-arbitrary SR mappings, where participants responded to the direction of arrow stimuli using spatially corresponding keys, while trying to ignore the spatially congruent or incongruent location of the stimuli. Despite robust congruency effects and optimal preparation conditions (100% valid cues, 2000ms preparation time), we observed no cue benefits in four experiments. Only when task difficulty was increased substantially (50ms stimulus presentation, Experiment 4) did cue benefits emerge, but exclusively for congruent trials. These findings document that non-arbitrary SR mappings are not a sufficient condition for ensuring cue-based engagement of proactive control, and suggest that cost-benefit calculations about control exertion may be a more promising candidate factor.",

          "abstract": "Pursuing a life of moral excellence is often seen as allowing a person not only to live by good and just principles but also to live an authentic life that brings them closest to their true self. This view is taken to reflect the priority that people should place on moral pursuits or “moral primacy.” The results of four preregistered studies (N = 2,911) suggest that people do not always hold this view and highlight a tension within it: how can morality both constrain human behavior and afford the freedom to be one’s truest self? We find that people resolve this conflict with ‘value pluralism,’ preferring a balance of life pursuits across several value domains, where aesthetic pursuits are viewed as affording freedom from convention. We then adapt a personal change paradigm from prior work and develop a novel paradigm to examine whether people’s intuitions about the true self also reveal that a broader set of values—not just moral ones—inform judgments of the true self. We find no differences in true self judgments following the loss of an aesthetic versus moral quality. However, when directly comparing life paths, the pursuit of aesthetic excellence is sometimes viewed as offering greater access to one’s true self compared with moral excellence, in part because aesthetic pursuits are seen as less rule bound. These findings offer insights into the myriad paths a person can take in life while pursuing autonomy, authenticity, and closeness to their true self.",

          "abstract": "The present research examines how intersecting social categories shape first impressions of competence, focusing on Black women. Across seven online studies (total N = [884]), we investigated whether competence judgments toward Black women reflect additive effects of race and gender stereotypes or stem from a distinct intersectional stereotype. Across studies, we consistently found an intersectional pattern of competence judgments: Participants rated Black men and White women as more competent than White men, but this was less true for Black women. This pattern was modulated by individual differences in bias control—specifically, motivation and executive function (Studies 5–7). While internal motivation to control prejudice predicted pro-minority responses, this effect was insufficient to produce an overall response tendency favoring Black women equally to White women and Black men. A meta-analysis of Studies 5–7 further revealed that cognitive control efficiency (assessed by a Stroop task) significantly predicted competence ratings for Black women only, suggesting that applying pro-minority control for Black women is more difficult compared to their constituent groups. In study 7, emphasizing race over gender did not restore pro-Black bias toward Black women, further supporting intersectional models that posit emergent or unique stereotypes. These findings challenge additive models of stereotyping, emphasizing the distinct psychological representation of intersectional targets. They also underscore the difficulty of regulating stereotypes for multiply marginalized individuals. Together, these results offer insight into the interplay between social categorization, motivation, and executive control in real-world impression formation.",

          "abstract": "Experimenter demand effects occur when participants alter their behavior to align with perceived study hypotheses, threatening internal validity. Concern about demand effects is pervasive in psychology. Experimenter demand may be especially acute in studies relying on experienced participants recruited online (e.g., via Prolific), who may readily guess hypotheses, or using common paradigms (e.g., vignette studies and interventions) where study goals are transparent. We conducted three preregistered experiments (N = 2,254) examining whether explicit demand cues influence online participants’ behavior across three paradigms commonly used in psychology: a dictator game, replicating prior work on demand effects (Experiment 1); a moral dilemma vignette (Experiment 2); and an intervention on group attitudes (Experiment 3). We randomly assigned participants on Prolific to receive information about the study’s hypothesis or to a no-information control. As expected, we find that receiving such information significantly shifts participants’ beliefs about the study’s hypothesis, creating an experimenter demand. Yet we find no evidence that learning any study’s hypothesis alters participants’ behavior, judgments, or attitudes, suggesting that demand effects may be elusive in online samples. These findings offer important insights for the design and interpretation of modern psychology experiments.",

          "abstract": "For a series of indicators used to assess psychosocial constructs, we propose reporting new types of correlation matrices to gain greater insight into the relation of the indicators with one another. What we define as the observed residual correlation(ORC) matrix can give insight as to whether, when a given indicator is above the indicator-average scores across all indicators for that individual, what other indicators might be anticipated to be above that individual’s average score as well. What we define as the relative excess correlation(REC) matrix, when reported, can give insight,for each pair of indicators, whether the strength of that particular correlation is above or below what might have been anticipated based on the correlation of each of those two indicators with all of the others.The ORC and REC matrices will, generally,have numerous negative entries even if all of the raw correlations between each pair of indicators are positive. We discuss the relation between these correlation matrices,their analogues for covariances, along with the interpretation of the correlations they reportand the insights they can provide in understanding the relation of indicators with one another.The analogue of the REC matrix for covariances has the attractive property that its entries have an expected value of zero under a classical test theory model. The positive deviations of the REC matrix entries from zero help identify clusters of indicators that are more strongly related toone another, providing insights somewhat analogous tofactor analysis, but without the need for rotations or decisions concerning the number of factors.",

          "abstract": "Individual learners often show a tendency to engage in self-reinforcing avoidance, a pattern referred to as a learning trap.  Across five experiments, we investigated the extent to which previously trapped learners can escape via social observational learning. While social observational learning did help a significant number of trapped learners escape, the majority of trapped learners remained trapped even after observing a partner demonstrate an optimal decision rule. Across several follow-up experiments, we unpack possible factors which limited the effectiveness of social observational learning. Overall, the results suggest that social decision rule inference (inferring a partner's decision rule from observed choices) was a key bottleneck for observational learning. Simulations show that these results were unanticipated by a leading model of social reward learning, and highlight a central role for inference in social learning.",

          "abstract": "Communication with artificial agents (e.g., animated characters in virtual reality, social robots) is becoming increasingly common. Understanding how to design these agents&apos; behaviours to best support social interactions is therefore essential. One key communicative behaviour that supports human-human interactions is eye gaze, which can signal an agent&apos;s focus of attention, goals, and intentions to interact. Previous research has demonstrated that beliefs about whether an agent is human- or artificially controlled influence the perceived significance of gaze at subjective, behavioural, and neurophysiological levels. The present study specifically examined how these beliefs shape the evaluation of gaze dynamics as signals of an agent&apos;s communicative intent---an essential process for recognising and responding to communication opportunities. Participants (n = 160) completed a semi-interactive online task with a virtual agent that displayed dynamic gaze sequences. In each trial, we manipulated whether eye contact was established and whether the agent looked at the same object twice. Participants decided whether the agent was communicating a request for assistance to access an object or privately inspecting it. Across two task blocks, we also manipulated whether participants believed the agent was human- or AI-controlled. We found that believing the agent to be human-controlled increased perceived communicativeness when gaze cues were ambiguous, but this effect was attenuated in the second block of the experiment. This pattern may reflect a learned adjustment specific to the experimental setup that involved relatively consistent agent behaviour. Nevertheless, subjective ratings indicated a preference for human- over AI-modelled data. Our findings provide insights into the complexities of gaze-based communication and highlight the role of user expectations in shaping interactions with artificial agents.",

          "abstract": "Children’s well-being is partly shaped by the neighborhoods in which they grow up. While past research has focused predominantly on deficits in disadvantaged neighborhoods, this systematic review synthesizes evidence on neighborhood resources that positively influence children’s well-being, adopting a strengths-based, interdisciplinary perspective. Drawing on 32 empirical studies across disciplines including psychology, sociology, health, and urban planning, this review explores how social, physical, and institutional neighborhood resources support children aged 6–12 years. Findings reveal that social cohesion, perceived safety, peer relationships, and adult support enhance emotional and social well-being. Physical resources such as parks, green spaces, and walkable infrastructure foster physical activity and life satisfaction, while institutional supports, including libraries, after-school programs, and community centers, contribute to subjective well-being and academic engagement. The review highlights the importance of context: effects vary by age, gender, socioeconomic background, and cultural setting. Mediators such as lower parenting stress, neighborhood satisfaction, and family resilience elucidate the mechanisms through which neighborhood resources affect well-being. Notably, participatory and qualitative research underscores children’s own perspectives and agency, revealing valued but often overlooked informal neighborhood features. This review calls for equity-oriented, transdisciplinary approaches that integrate children's voices and foster neighborhood environments as active supports for well-being and development.",

In Study 1, across three samples, we explored correlational relationships between primals and attitudes toward the arts and arts engagement behavior, finding that key primal world beliefs were consistently linked with the arts items. In Study 2, we conducted a five-week long visual art intervention experiment to examine potential changes in primals based on psychoeducational priming for certain methods of engaging with the art (i.e., focusing on art technique, social connections, or perspective taking). Although the experimental conditions did not differentially change primals, Good world belief increased and Hierarchical decreased. Further, key individual differences (i.e., openness to experience, aesthetic appreciation) predicted who was more likely to exhibit changes in primals following an art intervention. These studies provide initial evidence of the relevance of the arts in the study of primal world beliefs and provide suggestions for future work on this topic, including practical ways for changing primal world beliefs via arts engagement.",

This raises a question: Can cognitive conflict positively influence subsequent cognitive processes and human behaviour, or is it inherently deleterious? We designed three independent experiments to investigate behavioural changes after congruent and incongruent Stroop items in speeded motor reactions, response inhibition and implicit memory retrieval. Results revealed that cognitive conflict had a beneficial impact selectively on response inhibition, while no impact was observed on speeded responses or memory. Our studies highlight the positive consequences of cognitive conflict in boosting human cognition and behaviour, beyond the classic conflict adaptation, but only when both tasks involve conflict.",

We examined this claim by comparing the acceptability of clitic doubling in three different speaker groups: monolingual and heritage speakers of European Spanish, and Rioplatense Spanish monolinguals. Accusative clitic doubling is grammaticalized in Rioplatense but not in European Spanish, consistent with Rioplatense Spanish being a more diachronically innovative variety. If heritage speakers mirror diachronic change, they may perform more similarly to Rioplatense than European monolinguals. The results of an acceptability judgement task showed that heritage speakers had robust knowledge of clitics but did not show evidence of progressive behavior with accusative clitic doubling. We propose that grammatical innovation may crucially depend on the demographic characteristics of heritage speakers, and on the grammatical properties of the phenomenon tested.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Posting results to clinical trial registers is encouraged and even mandatory for certain trials. This study assessed the feasibility of using structured results data from ClinicalTrials.gov for meta-analyses on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) using two exemplary approaches. \n\nMethods: In study one, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov for studies employing CBT for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and extracted posted results. We evaluated whether the data were sufficient for running a meta-analysis. In study two, we selected a published meta-analysis on digital interventions for depression, extracted all registrations of the primary sources, and assessed if the meta-analysis could be reproduced using posted results.\n\nResults: For study one, we identified 179 completed studies on CBT for MDD from ClinicalTrials.gov. 16 of 179 studies had posted results and 15 had reported depression outcomes, using various psychological scales, such as the BDI-II. This low number of posted results and the heterogeneity of reported scales made running a meta-analysis infeasible. In study two, using 83 primary sources of a published meta-analysis, we obtained 59 registrations. Only three studies had  posted results, all to ClinicalTrials.gov. Again, this made running or reproducing the meta-analysis infeasible.\n\nConclusion: The potential for clinical trial registries to support meta-analyses is substantial, yet few studies on psychotherapy post their results. Core results of clinical trials should be openly available in a timely manner and in a structured format. Currently, it seems that the posting of results data is so uncommon that running meta-analyses using structured results data from trial registries is practically impossible.",

          "abstract": "Although fasting—abstaining from food for several hours to days—is generally considered safe and potentially beneficial for long-term health, concerns persist about its acute effects on cognitive function. Given the importance of sustaining adequate levels of cognitive performance for professional and personal activities, this potential side effect warrants careful examination. Here, we synthesize evidence from experimental studies comparing cognitive performance between fasted and satiated healthy adults using standardized psychological tasks. Analyzing 222 effect sizes across 3,484 participants (median fasting duration: 12 hours), our hierarchical random-effects model revealed no meaningful difference between fasted and satiated participants (g = 0.02, 95% CrI = [-0.05, 0.10]), with low between-study heterogeneity (τ = 0.17). Notably, we observed modest reductions in cognitive performance for longer fasting intervals, and for younger (vs. older) participants during fasts. Differences across cognitive domains (e.g., attention and inhibitory control) were negligible. These findings suggest that cognitive performance remains remarkably stable during short-term fasting, supporting the feasibility of fasting practices while highlighting nuanced considerations for implementation in health interventions.",

We investigated the relationship between symptom severity, attributional biases, and perceptions of emotional relationships and risk behaviors (ERRB) from both perspectives. Six female patients with BPD receiving outpatient treatment in Brazil and six family members participated. Data were collected remotely and included a BPD symptom measure, an attributional bias task, and semi-structured interviews for genogram construction exploring family ERRB. Patients showed higher intentionality scores (p = 0.0357) and more reports of physical abuse (p = 0.0235), whereas family members reported more distant/poor relationships (p = 0.0198). Categorical symptom severity correlated with suspected alcohol and drug use (p = 0.0117), and personalization bias predicted continuous symptom severity (β = 0.16, p = 0.0283). Qualitative analysis identified significant relationships within each dyad and the family members involved. These findings highlight how attributional biases and ERRB shape BPD symptoms and suggest that integrating family narratives with cognitive assessments enriches clinical understanding of underlying mechanisms.",

We then introduce specific instances of converging evidence between the fields, suggesting that presence and reality are likely to be constituted by the same integrative theoretical models, psychophysical mechanisms and neural architecture. Evidence from neuroimaging supports this claim, revealing overlapping brain regions involved in both presence and reality perception. This reconceptualization of VR presence as reality has implications  for research on consciousness, psychiatric disorders involving reality perception, and the use of virtual reality as a tool for studying and modifying perceptual experience. Future research should directly compare presence and reality mechanisms to explore their functional and neural equivalence, potentially redefining how we study consciousness and perception.",

          "authors": "Rotem Avital-Cohen; Nurit Gronau",
          "abstract": "Studies of visual long-term memory (VLTM) increasingly focus on how object features are stored and interrelated, with object-based accounts proposing integrated representations and feature-based views emphasizing independent feature storage and retrieval. More recent hybrid models suggest graded levels of interdependency, yet the role of semantic meaning in shaping these dependencies has remained underexplored. The present study advances a graded perspective by examining how semantic content, manipulated at the individual feature level, modulates relations among visual details. Specifically, we investigated whether color, when meaningful to an object’s identity, enhances memory for arbitrary, surface-level properties such as location or size. A preliminary survey established which object-color pairings were perceived as semantically meaningful versus meaningless. Participants showed superior memory for meaningful colors (Experiment 1a), regardless of verbal suppression (Experiment 1b), validating our manipulation. We then used conditional dependency analyses to assess whether memory for location (Experiment 2a) or size (Experiment 2b) was contingent on memory for color. Across both immediate and delayed tests, we found significant feature interdependency in both color conditions, but critically, dependency was greater when color was meaningful (although only in the delayed test for size). These findings support continuous accounts of VLTM, showing that memory representations are neither wholly integrated nor fully fragmented. Instead, semantic information strengthens both memory for individual features and their binding to otherwise arbitrary details. By manipulating semantic value at the feature level, our results demonstrate how conceptual meaning shapes the coherence of VLTM representations, providing new evidence for graded models of object memory.",

          "authors": "Alexandra Paquette; Krista Byers-Heinlein",
          "abstract": "Language mixing is a common feature of bilingual communication, yet its predictors and effects on children’s vocabulary development remain debated. Most research has been conducted in contexts with clear societal and heritage languages, leaving open questions about language mixing in environments with two societal languages. Montreal provides a unique opportunity to examine this question, as both French and English hold societal status, while many families also maintain heritage languages. Using archival data from 398 bilingual children (7–34 months), we looked at French-English bilinguals (representing societal bilingualism) and heritage-language bilinguals within the same sociolinguistic environment. We assessed the prevalence, predictors, and motivations of parental language mixing, and its relationship with vocabulary development. Results revealed that mixing was less frequent among French-English bilinguals compared to heritage-language bilinguals in the same city. The direction of mixing differed between groups: French-English bilinguals mixed based on language dominance, while heritage-language bilinguals mixed based on societal language status. Primary motivations included uncertainty about word meanings, lack of suitable translations, and teaching new words. Mixing showed minimal associations with vocabulary size across participants. These findings suggest that parental mixing practices reflect adaptive strategies that vary by sociolinguistic context rather than detrimental influences on early language acquisition.",

Trajectories were established using growth mixture modelling (GMM) and multinomial regression was employed to explore the influence of gender and ethnicity.\nResults: Five distinct and unique trajectories were established as minimal (66.8%), moderate (19.1%), Emerging Adulthood (EA) trough (7.6%), persistently high (3.3%) and EA peak (3.1%). Being female and non-white increased the probability of being in the elevated trajectories during adolescence.  \nConclusion: Three stable and two fluctuating trajectories demonstrate both the predictability and heterogeneity of depression across three distinct developmental stages.",

Interventions for cannabis use problems could improve through personalization with ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and derived personalized feedback including idiographic networks. To study preliminary efficacy and feasibility, this pilot preclinical randomized controlled trial compared a short version of treatment as usual (TAU) to the same with the add-on of EMA and personalized feedback.\nDesign. We conducted a pilot parallel two-arm randomized controlled trial.\nSetting. Data were collected at the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands (March to November 2023).\nParticipants. We included participants aged 18-30, with good English proficiency, owning smartphones, using cannabis flower at least weekly, and wanting help to stop or diminish use. Current treatment for or diagnosis of a substance use or psychotic disorder were exclusion criteria. We recruited through flyers, social media, peer-to-peer recruitment, and the University of Amsterdam lab. We used block randomization stratified by gender; participants were blind to condition.\nIntervention. Both groups received TAU, additionally, the experimental group received EMA and personalized feedback (TAU+).\nMeasurements. Main outcomes were self-reported cannabis use and cannabis use disorder (CUD) DSM-5 symptoms. Secondary outcomes were mental health variables. Predictors were time, condition, and their interaction. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with TAU+ participants and practitioners giving the intervention and analyzed with thematic analysis.\nFindings. 90 participants were screened, 76 were randomized, 13 per group were included (target sample size), other randomized participants either declined participation/had to be excluded or were in the waiting list. Two experimental and one control participants dropped out (23 participants included in the analyses). Average cannabis grams smoked per day, days smoking cannabis, and CUD symptoms decreased in both groups (p &lt; .001). However, only TAU+ participants maintained the change for the three main outcome measures at three-months follow-up (p = .038, .035, .056 respectively). Both interventions diminished depression, stress, and negative emotions. No adverse events occurred. Participants reported high perceived usefulness, ease of use and motivation regarding the personalized feedback, but some difficulties and negative emotions in answering EMA. Practitioners’ interview results suggested the need to simplify the tool for practitioners and give more training on communicating feedback. \nConclusions. Adding personalized EMA and feedback to TAU seems feasible and may reduce relapse rates in problematic cannabis use compared to TAU alone. A larger trial is needed to support these results.",

          "abstract": "Psychological systems are complex, exhibiting nonlinear behavior, emergence, adaptation, and feedback loops. To better capture this complexity, researchers are increasingly using mechanistic computational models (i.e., computer code designed to represent explanatory principles or rules of a target system from which data can be simulated). Despite this growing interest, there is little guidance on how to most effectively develop and use computational models in psychological research. Other scientific disciplines, such as ecology and chemistry, have used computational modeling extensively for decades and may offer valuable insights from which psychologists can learn. This scoping review synthesizes methodological steps used in developing and evaluating computational models across disciplines, spanning physical and biopsychosocial phenomena. We identified 53 computational modeling roadmaps and conducted a narrative synthesis with frequency analyses. The narrative synthesis is organized according to three research questions: i) what is the general purpose of computational modeling?; ii) what are the proposed modeling steps?; iii) how should researchers move through the modeling steps? For each of these research questions, we also examined whether roadmaps aimed at modeling physical phenomena differ from those that aim at modeling biopsychosocial phenomena. Our narrative synthesis identifies critical gaps in the existing modeling roadmaps and offers a foundation for developing more comprehensive how-to guides for psychologists seeking to integrate computational modeling into their research.",

To address this, we investigated social reward processing during prolonged isolation by modelling Twitter activity during COVID-19, when online spaces substituted for in-person contact. By fitting computational models to US Twitter users (n=535 and n=553,945 tweets), we found that social media posting was driven by both reinforcement learning (receiving more ‘likes’ decreased time between posts) and habitual processes (time between posts was influenced by previous behaviour). During prolonged social isolation, users were more sensitive to social media social rewards: ‘likes’ more strongly influenced the decision to post more or less frequently. These findings provide the first large-scale study of social reward processing during prolonged isolation, using ecologically valid data and more representative samples to translate principles of social reward processing into human prolonged isolation.",

          "abstract": "Children learn to represent the world around them in meaningful categories that allow them to generalize past experiences. Understanding how these categorical representations develop is fundamental to cognitive science. However, capturing the structure of human conceptual knowledge is a challenging experimental task. The most prominent approach, Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), usually requires participants to produce many similarity judgments, leading to long experiments. Moreover, the representations found by MDS are limited to the fixed set of experimental stimuli and have to be reconstructed for every new item. In contrast, we present a more flexible machine-learning method that can generalize to novel stimuli. This method uses a child-friendly task that allows researchers to uncover the development of categories with fewer participant judgments. We evaluate our approach on simulated data and find that it can accurately reveal representations even when trained on data generated by groups that categorize differently. We then analyze data from the World Color Survey and find that we can recover language-specific color organization when aggregating languages that only share the same number of basic color terms. Finally, we use the method in a developmental experiment and find age-dependent differences in how complex fruit stimuli are organized. These differences were consistent with participants' reasoning and additional experimental measures. Our results suggest that our approach is applicable in psychological tasks and opens the possibility of examining children's developing psychological spaces in new detail.",

          "authors": "Jianghao Liu",
          "abstract": "Subjective imagery refers to one’s quasi-perceptual experience in the absence of direct external input. Yet around 4% of individuals with “aphantasia” report an inability to voluntarily generate such experiences. This phenomenon provides a natural experiment that challenges current theories of imagery, which typically assume that reactivation of the visual cortex in imagery generation is sufficient for imagery experience. In fact, neuroimaging evidence shows that aphantasic individuals can reactivate visual cortex normally during imagery tasks, indicating that additional, as-yet-unspecified, processes are required for subjective experience to emerge. \nIn this theory paper, I propose an attention-based model of subjective imagery (“the attention model”) with two aims: (i) to outline a hierarchical processing, in which generation provides initial sensory reactivations, integration binds these features into coherent perceptual-like content, and amplification enhances them for conscious access, capturing both voluntary and spontaneous imagery; and (ii) to specify a putative neural implementation in a fronto-parietal-fusiform network shaped by two interacting attention systems. Aphantasia primarily reflects deficits in top-down modulation, with preserved generation but impaired integration and amplification of internal representations, linked to altered interactions between frontoparietal attention networks and the fusiform gyrus.\nOverall, this model reframes imagery as an active, constructive process shaped by the dynamic interplay of attention, sensory, and memory networks, rather than a passive reactivation of memory traces. It offers a testable mechanistic account of the neural substrates of subjective imagery and aphantasia, motivating future research on unconscious and conscious processing of internal representations.",

Some departments are also seeking to redress the colonial structures engrained within higher education. Students are central to this work. However, research exploring students’ views on curriculum decolonisation is limited. To address this, we interviewed 21 psychology students at a UK university and, using a critical realist lens, analysed contextual factors and mechanisms that may explain why students engage (or not) with decolonial initiatives, under what circumstances, and how. We analysed four contextual layers. At the individual layer, engagement was influenced by prior knowledge and beliefs, sense of agency, educational mindset and priorities, and teacher influence. At the interpersonal layer, peer influence, comfort and openness, class diversity, and teaching style influenced engagement. Within the institutional layer, factors including student workload, faculty diversity and training, and organisational emphasis shaped student engagement. The infrastructural layer involved historical exposure and knowledge, legacies, and perceived zeitgeist as influencing student engagement. Mechanisms including psychological safety, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and teacher enthusiasm appeared as key drivers influencing these contexts. We propose 11 Context-Mechanism-Outcome statements hypothesising how the learning environment, student and teacher identities, workload, prior beliefs and organisational support affect engagement with decolonial learning. Finally, we discuss how meritocratic ideals in education undermine student participation in decolonial initiatives.",

We first provide a brief overview of recent frameworks developed in the respective research traditions: the BRAC framework (Frings et al., 2020) and the procedural working memory (WM) model (Oberauer, 2013). We then analyze the similarities and differences between the BRAC and WM perspectives. As a first step toward fostering an integrative model of action control, we present an extension of the procedural WM model that can account for the main empirical findings investigated within the BRAC framework and that might serve as a blueprint for future integration.",

          "abstract": "Prior research examining the impact of job loss on personality change has yielded inconsistent findings. The present preregistered study extends prior research by analyzing longitudinal data from 1,111 predominantly 1st generation Mexican-origin adults, who reported on their employment status and Big Five personality traits up to eight times over 16 years. We explored the influence of both individual and spousal unemployment on three forms of personality trait stability and change: rank-order stability, Big Five profile stability, and mean-level changes. Job loss had no significant effects on rank-order stability, whether experienced by self or spousal. However, job loss was associated with lower profile stability; those who experienced unemployment showed lower stability in their personality profiles than those who remained employed. Job loss was associated with a wide range of mean-level personality changes; collectively, the findings suggest that the experience of unemployment can disrupt the normative process of maturation, leading to decreases in conscientiousness and agreeableness and impeding the typical decline in neuroticism. Our study is the first to establish a spillover effect of spousal job loss on partners' personality dynamics, demonstrating that personality changes can occur in response to a partner's job loss. In some cases these changes paralleled those found for one’s own job loss (declines in agreeableness and openness), whereas in other cases we found evidence of a compensatory effect (where individuals whose partner lost their job increased in conscientiousness). These findings highlight the importance of studying the effects of major life transitions on personality change in diverse samples.",

In the field of psychopathology, the evolution of psychiatric nosology reflects the changing paradigms in our understanding of mental disorders. From the primordial attempts to categorize disorders based on spiritualistic perspectives to a more standardized approach influenced by clinical observations and scientific understandings. The 20th century witnessed the publication of the International Classification of Disease (ICD) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which have defined the constructs we study and treat for decades. Nevertheless, as the chapters in this book will no doubt serve to remind us, this journey is not without controversies and challenges. The inherent complexity and diversity of mental health conditions present difficulties in creating discrete categories that fully capture individuals’ experiences. Issues such as cultural variability and dynamic changes in mental health over time further complicate the task of constructing a reliable organization of psychopathology. \n\nGiven the shortcomings of traditional classification systems like the ICD and DSM, the field has recently witnessed the emergence of alternative approaches to classification, such as the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP; Kotov et al., 2017). The goal of this chapter is to briefly review important features of a useful nosology, describe the origin and structure of HiTOP, and discuss its implications for clinical practice, research endeavours, and the broader understanding of mental health within the context of an ever-evolving scientific landscape. Additionally, we will address some of the major criticisms of the quantitative approach to classification represented by HiTOP and describe ongoing efforts to address them.",

Participants evaluated Instagram posts containing scientific and pseudoscientific content before and after the interventions. While previous research shows the efficacy of these techniques in controlled environments, this study found no significant improvement in students’ ability to discern accurate information. However, COR indirectly enhanced accuracy by promoting lateral reading and click restraint, albeit among a small subset. Conversely, the INOC approach increased generalised scepticism, leading to reduced trust in scientifically valid content. We observe that unlike in non-ecological environments, the classroom environment poses challenges, including distractions and varied engagement, highlighting the difficulty of scaling interventions from controlled to real-world settings.

Here we used EEG to investigate how intrinsic timescales develop from infancy to toddlerhood and how they compare to adults. A recent rs-fMRI study found sleeping neonates had longer timescales than awake adults. However, fMRI is affected by hemodynamics, has limited temporal resolution, and timescales may be affected by sleep. Therefore, EEG was used to measure intrinsic timescales in infants longitudinally from 6 to 16-months-old (exploratory cohort, N=45; validation cohort, N=45) and adults (N=10). Infants were awake and engaged in visual stimulation, and adults were recorded under comparable (vs. different) conditions. Six-month-olds’ timescales were longer than those of adults in comparable conditions, and they shortened from 6 to 16-months-old. Finally, in younger infants, brain timescales correlated to alpha rhythm self-predictability. Longer intrinsic timescales early in infancy, a finding which generalises across fMRI and EEG, might act as an inductive bias favouring the learning of holistic abstract representations. Delineating the mechanisms underlying brain processing timescales in infants is a crucial step towards understanding the neural mechanisms which could allow infants to extract and learn patterns from the environment.",

Visual contact between singers increased head and hand movements across all activities. Hand synchrony was significantly higher during musical activities vs chat. Also, structured musical activities (monophony and polyphony) increased head synchrony, tone onset energy, and tone onset synchrony compared to free-form activities (chat and improvisation). These findings highlight the importance of visual cues in maintaining synchrony and coordination during choir singing and provide a multimodal understanding of the differences between joint spoken and sung performances.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Ohms",
          "abstract": "Purpose: This study empirically investigates the direct relationships between three prominent cognitive biases (i.e. overconfidence bias [OB], herding bias [HB] and decision avoidance bias [AB]) and two crucial stages of workplace decision-making (i.e. evaluating information [EI] and searching information [SI]). \nDesign/methodology/approach: A mono-quantitative, cross-sectional survey was conducted amongst 365 employees in Singapore. Statistical techniques such as paired sample t-tests, correlation analysis and multiple regression were employed.\nFindings: Results indicated that OB significantly and positively correlates with EI (r = 0.582, p &lt; 0.001) and SI (r = 0.537, p &lt; 0.001). Similarly, HB exhibits a significant positive relationship with EI (r = 0.340, p &lt; 0.001) and SI (r = 0.418, p &lt; 0.001). By contrast, AB demonstrates a significant negative relationship with EI (r = −0.209, p &lt; 0.001) and SI (r = −0.171, p &lt; 0.001).\nOriginality: This work extends research on decision-making biases beyond financial and investment contexts by examining their role in workplace settings. It contributes to behavioural economics and organisational studies by offering empirical evidence from Singapore, a context underrepresented in existing literature.\nResearch limitations/implications: This study focused on only three biases within a cross-sectional quantitative design, which may be affected by survey errors and outliers. Future research should test additional biases, stages and moderating factors across industries, regions and disciplines to build a more comprehensive understanding of workplace decision-making.\nPractical implications: The research contributes to a better understanding of organisational decision-making practices for employees in the workplace when heuristics and biases are present. It raises awareness among organisations and provides a foundation for future research to strengthen decision-making practices.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Ohms",
          "abstract": "This paper outlines the methodological approach to Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) model selection employed in a quantitative study investigating cognitive biases in workplace decision-making in Singapore. Building upon a comprehensive systematic literature review (Ohms 2025g), which identified key research gaps and prominent cognitive biases, and a subsequent paper detailing the research framework and hypothesis development (Ohms 2025f), this study aimed to holistically assess the complex interplay between biases, decision-making stages, and moderating factors. The robust methodological design (Ohms 2025e) and data validation procedures (Ohms 2025a), including outlier detection, normality assessment, and reliability testing, provided the essential foundation for advanced statistical analysis. This paper specifies, estimates, and systematically refines the SEM model through a backward elimination strategy. It elaborates on the choice of a robust estimator, the interpretation of various model fit indices (e.g., Chi-square, CFI, TLI, RMSEA, AIC, BIC), and the iterative selection of the most simplified yet well-fitting model (Model 15). By thoroughly documenting the rigorous SEM model selection methodology, this paper contributes to establishing a strong analytical basis for subsequent empirical investigations into direct and moderated relationships, ensuring the reliability and validity of the holistic insights derived from the research.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Ohms",
          "abstract": "This paper investigates the moderating role of time pressure on the relationships between three prominent cognitive biases, Overconfidence Bias (OB), Herding Bias (HB), and Decision Avoidance Bias (AB), and two stages of workplace decision-making: Evaluating Information (EI) and Searching Information (SI). Building from the theoretical foundation established by Ohms (2025h) and the significant research gaps noted by Ohms (2025i),  this study uses a cross-sectional, mono-quantitative survey methodology (Ohms (2025g) of 365 employees in Singapore. Additionally, Ohms (2025a) documented the data validation and preliminary analysis, which provided a concrete basis for more complex analyses. Hence, this paper builds upon the analysis of direct effects reported by Ohms (2025b, 2025c) and applies the specific methodological procedures for moderation detailed by Ohms (2025e). Results from multiple regression with robust standard errors show that time pressure does not significantly moderate the strong effects of overconfidence and herding biases on either stage of information processing. However, time pressure moderates the relationship between decision avoidance and information evaluation by weakening the negative impact of avoidance. These results contribute to behavioural economics and provide helpful information for organisational decision-making in the Singaporean workplace by emphasising the selective nature of time pressure as a contextual stressor.",

The present research validates data from an Eastern culture—China—offering a promising solution. We conducted 11 preregistered studies with 18,256 Chinese and American online participants, examining well-established phenomena across various social science disciplines. The findings provide strong evidence that Chinese online platforms offer geographically and demographically diverse samples from across China. These participants are highly attentive and produce valid data. Additionally, we find tentative evidence that language is a surmountable barrier for Western researchers, as translation variations had little impact on Chinese participants’ responses in our tests. Finally, we share practical insights on using Chinese online platforms for data collection.

          "abstract": "Devraj et al. (Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review. doi:10.3758/s13423-023-02448-2, 2024) argued that findings which suggest that memories for items become less accessible over time conflict with categorisation findings where exemplar performance improves across training. To reconcile this, they highlighted that under real-world conditions items tend to reappear less frequently over time, thus preferentially maintaining new items can improve performance. Typical categorisation experiments instead distribute exemplars uniformly across trials. Instead, under a power-law stimulus distribution Devraj et al. showed worsening fit for exemplar classification models across trials. They used this as evidence that forgetting behaviour adapted to task demands, reducing exemplar were accessibility and encouraging prototype use for classification decisions. By re-analysing the same data, we argue instead that this pattern can be produced with exemplar-forgetting in both conditions. By systematically increasing in the delays across which stimuli were tested, their Experimental condition exaggerated the effects of forgetting on performance in later trials compared to the Control condition. This resulted in a reversal of performance growth across trials – instead leading to a steady decline in performance. As exemplar model-fit advantage is expected to vary with performance, we suggest that trends in this advantage are not diagnostic of a shift in classification strategy. We found that a forgetting-function improved exemplar model fit to Devraj et al.’s data, and under reasonable parameters could predict the observed patterns of performance and model-fit a-priori. Compared with a strategy-shifting mixture model, exemplar-forgetting provided equivalent fits despite being more theoretically parsimonious. We suggest power-law memory decay does not produce a tension between categorisation and memory findings, as increased forgetting is found across longer retention intervals whereas the delay between exemplar learning and classification remains constant across typical categorisation experiments.",

          "authors": "Amith Sunny Aranha",
          "abstract": "Effective leadership in healthcare is a critical determinant of both staff well-being and patient outcomes. This evidence-based review explores the influence of three primary leadership styles—transformational, transactional, and servant leadership—on healthcare team performance. Transformational leadership is shown to inspire innovation, motivation, and higher staff engagement, while transactional leadership provides structure, accountability, and clarity in high-stakes environments. Servant leadership emphasizes empathy, collaboration, and the prioritization of staff needs, contributing to stronger team morale and reduced turnover. Across multiple studies, leadership styles were consistently linked to patient safety, satisfaction, and the overall quality of care. The findings suggest that healthcare organizations benefit most from adaptive leaders who balance transformational vision, transactional structure, and servant-oriented support. This paper highlights the importance of cultivating evidence-based leadership practices to strengthen organizational performance and ensure sustainable improvements in healthcare delivery.\n\nKeywords: Healthcare leadership, Transformational leadership, Team performance, Patient safety, Staff retention, Evidence-based management",

          "abstract": "Electoral accountability is a cornerstone of democratic governance, yet whether voters effectively punish corruption remains theoretically and empirically contested. While canonical models predict that corruption revelations reduce incumbent support, strategic voting considerations—especially beliefs about others’ behavior—can yield ambiguous accountability outcomes. We exploit a major corruption scandal involving Japan’s ruling party during a national election to examine how social information shapes electoral responses to misconduct. In a pre-registered field experiment, we randomly provided voters with information about prevailing social norms of intolerance toward the scandal. This intervention significantly increased overall turnout and challenger support, particularly among swing voters, consistent with enhanced accountability. Yet the same treatment increased incumbent support among ruling-party loyalists. We show that these heterogeneous effects are systematically driven by voters’ prior beliefs about others’ voting intentions: those expecting others to punish sanctioned more when learning they would not, whereas those expecting tolerance defended more when learning others would punish. These findings reconcile conflicting evidence on electoral accountability by showing how strategic considerations fundamentally shape democratic sanctioning, and suggest that information campaigns can either strengthen or undermine accountability depending on the distribution of voter expectations, with important implications for anti-corruption interventions.",

          "abstract": "Why do people adopt new and different religious beliefs and practices, especially when it is often costly? Economic approaches to religion highlight the role of material conditions on people’s religious affiliation. However, studies often rely on data inconsistent with the level of analysis of their hypothesized mechanisms, or infer material motivations to join a new religion from observed material outcomes. We present an econometric study of religious conversion by focusing on the increase in non-Catholic Christianity in Chiapas, Mexico. This state has the most converts, as well as the poorest and least formally educated population in the country, suggesting education and material conditions influence conversion. We test this hypothesis by analyzing longitudinal municipality level data from the Mexican Population Census (1950-2020). To account for potential endogeneity between education or material conditions across waves, we implement a structural equation model for the analysis of longitudinal panel data. We fail to find a significant effect of material conditions (either positive or negative) on changes in religious affiliation in Chiapas. However, we find effect heterogeneity of education on religious change driven by its interaction with distance to urban centers. These findings are consistent with previous cross-national studies on religious conversion.",

          "abstract": "Heterosexual-identified men who have sex with men (H-MSM) defy dominant sexuality frameworks that assume coherence between sexual identity, attraction, and behaviour. While extant models of sexual minority and heterosexual identity and attraction presume that H-MSM experience identity confusion and crisis and that ‘primarily or mostly heterosexual men’ exhibit equal levels of opposite-sex arousal as exclusive heterosexuals but report lower levels of same-sex sexuality than bisexuals in their attractions, fantasies, and behaviours, little research has examined how H-MSM experience sexual identity and attraction. This article is framed by Queer Theory and utilizes interpretative phenomenology to explore how a qualitative sample of 10 H-MSM navigate and negotiate their sexual identity and attraction. Results demonstate that H-MSM situate their same-sex attraction as physical, situational, and exploratory while employing gendered and relational scripts. At the same time, H-MSM sustain their heterosexual identity by decoupling identity from attraction and negotiating identity through heteroromantic desire. These findings demonstrate how sexuality is lived as fluid, shifting, and contingent, rather than as a linear trajectory toward categorical resolution. Unlike stage-based models that interpret identity-attraction-behaviour discordance as confusion or denial, participants described their identities as coherent, meaningful, and grounded in their romantic and long-term commitments to women. Same-sex attraction was acknowledged but framed as separate from participants’ perceived emotional weight of heterosexual relationships. By illustrating how individuals actively weigh and assign meaning to different aspects of sexuality, the study broadens understandings of sexual identity and attraction.",

Utilizando los hallazgos de una extensa colección de meta-análisis, se evalúa la efectividad de los instrumentos de política monetaria convencionales y no convencionales sobre variables macroeconómicas clave como la producción, la inflación, los flujos de capital y el tipo de cambio. La evidencia agregada revela una brecha sistemática entre los efectos reportados en estudios primarios y la magnitud real de dichos efectos, una vez que se corrige por el sesgo de publicación y la heterogeneidad metodológica. Los hallazgos sugieren que, si bien la política monetaria es una herramienta relevante, su poder para modular el ciclo económico ha sido consistentemente sobrestimado en la literatura. Se identifican los factores contextuales—como el grado de desarrollo financiero, el régimen cambiario, la independencia del banco central y las condiciones de crisis—que modulan la transmisión de la política monetaria. En particular, se constata que el sesgo de publicación favorece sistemáticamente resultados estadísticamente significativos y consistentes con la teoría predominante, lo que infla artificialmente la percepción de eficacia. Al corregir estas distorsiones, emerge una imagen de la política monetaria con efectos más modestos, inciertos y con retardos considerables, lo que tiene profundas implicaciones para la teoría macroeconómica y la práctica de la política económica.",

          "authors": "Maher Asaad Baker; Fuad Al-Qrize",
          "abstract": "The protracted conflict in Yemen, entering its tenth year in 2025, has catalyzed one of the world's most severe humanitarian and educational crises. This study employs a longitudinal analysis of key educational indicators from 2015 to 2023, drawing on data from UNICEF, the Yemen Education Cluster, and the World Bank. Moving beyond a mere accounting of decline, we argue that the available data itself serves as a powerful indicator of state collapse. The systematic erosion of national-level educational statistics mirrors the disintegration of government capacity, forcing a reliance on fragmented humanitarian snapshots that document interventions, not a national system. Our findings reveal a sector in profound disrepair: an estimated 4.5 million out-of-school children, widespread destruction of school infrastructure necessitating temporary learning spaces, and the complete dependence of the teaching workforce on externally-funded incentives rather than state salaries. The data consistently shows entrenched gender disparities, exacerbated by negative coping mechanisms like child labor and marriage. This paper concludes that the Yemeni education system has transitioned from a public good to a donor-dependent humanitarian service. The primary methodological finding is that the absence of comprehensive data is a direct consequence of conflict and a critical variable for analysis. We recommend that international policy shift from short-term emergency response to sustainable, locally-led system-building and that future research focus on the qualitative experiences within this collapsed educational landscape.",

Using a transdisciplinary methodology, the study examines human-wildlife coexistence in two contrasting social-ecological systems in South Africa: the Garden Route and the Kalahari. We engage local actors as research partners and develop participatory workshops, collaborative timelines, and focus group discussions to identify the relational values underpinning coexistence, explicitly focusing on the dimensions of care, knowledge, and agency associated with stewardship actions. \nDistinct stewardship positions emerged, reflecting different visions of human-wildlife interactions and conservation. Indigenous research partners notably highlighted transformative stewardship, promoting an inclusive worldview that integrates humans and wildlife through mutual respect and cultural recognition. Conversely, other research partners demonstrated varied stewardship positions ranging from adaptive to sustainability-focused action.\nThe findings underscore the need to explicitly incorporate relational values and care dimensions into conservation strategies, highlighting their potential to enhance legitimacy, credibility, and effectiveness in addressing social-ecological complexity.

Using the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and analyzing 40,000 genotyped mother–father–child trios, we test whether children’s polygenic indices (PGIs) predict subsequent fertility, partnership dissolution, and transition to marriage. Accounting for parental PGIs, we found limited evidence for evocative effects across most traits. The exception was that children with a higher ADHD PGI predicted increased parental partnership dissolution (7% [CI=2.9-11.8%] per s.d.), especially in families with daughters (11% [CI=4.9-18%] per s.d.), higher socioeconomic status (15% [CI=7.7-23.2%] per s.d.), and older maternal age at first birth (10% [CI=3-17%] per s.d.). The main source of variation is the socio-economic dimension where child-driven effects are stronger in higher-SES families. The study provides evidence for evocative gene-environment correlations in family demography, demonstrating the importance of child-to-parent effects in shaping family trajectories.",

          "abstract": "We identify a form of gender-based governmental discrimination that directly affects billions of women on a daily basis: the setting of import tariffs for gendered goods. These tax rates, which can differ across otherwise identical gender-specific products, often impose direct penalties on women as consumers. Comparing nearly 200,000 paired tariff rates on men’s and women’s apparel products in 167 countries between 1995 and 2015, we find that women suffer a tax penalty that varies systematically across countries. We demonstrate that in democracies, women’s presence in the legislature is associated with decreased import tax penalties on women’s goods. This finding is buttressed by a comparison of democracies and non-democracies and analyses of the implementation of legislative gender quotas. Our work highlights a previously unacknowledged government policy that penalizes women and also provides powerful evidence that descriptive representation can have a substantial, direct impact on discriminatory policies.",

          "abstract": "The population of Advanced Capitalist Democracies (ACDs) has aged substantially in the last decades. Yet, we know little about the consequences of ageing for the electoral politics of economic performance. This article develops a novel theoretical framework linking ageing to lower economic growth in four interrelated steps: first, elderly voters care more about pensions, but less about childcare, family, and education policies; second, they are less likely to penalize governments for low growth and unemployment; third, grey power pushes governments to protect the growing share of budgets allocated to pensions at the expense of more growth-enhancing policies, most notably social and public investments, while also weakening policy responsiveness during recessions; fourth, this policy reallocation undermines economic growth. This theory is tested using multilevel and fixed-effects regressions, an instrumental variable approach, and causal mediation analysis on micro- and macro-level data across 21 ACDs from the 1960s onwards. The results show that ageing fundamentally alters the electoral politics of economic stagnation in ACDs.",

          "abstract": "The sibling correlation, or intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), is a widely used omnibus measure of the total impact of family background on socioeconomic outcomes in social stratification research. A growing literature compares these correlations across subgroups defined by family-level characteristics (e.g., race, parental education) to test theories of social reproduction, such as parental compensation or reinforcement. In this note, I highlight the ambiguities involved in meaningfully interpreting such subgroup variation. I first define the theoretical estimand of intergenerational transmission that researchers are arguably most interested in, and then formally demonstrate why group-specific ICCs do not identify this estimand. In fact, the estimand of interest cannot be recovered from the variance-components models underlying sibling correlations unless researchers are willing to make assumptions that are not only untestable but also likely unrealistic.",

          "authors": "WEI MENG",
          "abstract": "This study aims to examine how China's newly appointed ambassador to Thailand employs event networks and temporal dynamics to demonstrate issue entry and structural embedding in early diplomatic practices, thereby revealing the priorities and potential trends in China's diplomacy toward Thailand. Existing research predominantly focuses on macro-policy levels, lacking systematic quantitative analysis of event-level diplomatic activities. This study seeks to fill this gap. Methodologically, it employs an event-level observation-computational empirical design, constructing five-layer networks (administrative, legislative, multilateral, social, and media) and time series based on open-source intelligence (OSINT). The analytical process follows the HCLS paradigm: identifying structural hubs (Hub) via the Bridge Center Early Warning Index (BCEW), detecting rhythmic inflection points (Change) using CUSUM, BOCPD, and PELT methods, characterizing lead-response lag relationships (Lag) between issues through cross-correlation and Hawkes processes, and translating multidimensional evidence into issue priority scores (Score) using AHP→TOPSIS. (Score). Results indicate that the administrative and multilateral layers exhibit significant hub status within the network, while security and multilateral issues show statistically significant rhythmic inflection points within short-term windows. “Security→Administrative” and “Multilateral→UN-ESCAP” demonstrate strong coupling at zero lag, whereas legislative channel coupling is weaker and transient. Multi-criteria ranking indicates that security, digital cooperation, and multilateral rules form the priority issue sequence, remaining robust to weight perturbations. Integrating four evidence chains reveals that China's recent diplomatic focus toward Thailand centers on amplifying issue linkage through administrative and multilateral platforms, gradually shifting toward narrative coupling of rule-building and public diplomacy in the medium term. In conclusion, this study not only proposes a reproducible, falsifiable event-level diplomatic analysis methodology but also reveals the logical chain of “hub prioritization—issue triggering—platform amplification—narrative coupling—trend insight” in China-Thailand relations. This research offers a quantitative perspective for understanding the micro-operational mechanisms of Chinese diplomacy while providing empirical evidence for policy formulation and regional cooperation.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the legitimation strategies employed by organizations engaging in criminal activities to influence public opinion about the legitimacy of these criminal activities. These discursive strategies are used to justify criminal actions, such as corruption, fraud, or violence, within broader organizational and cultural contexts. Often involving moral neutralization and moral licensing techniques, these strategies allow organizations engaged in criminal activities to present themselves and their actions as virtuous or justified. Although these strategies can result in societal harm by undermining public support for law enforcement, little is known about what types of legitimation strategies exist, how they differ, and how they influence public opinion. Hence, this scoping review identifies and categorizes the legitimation strategies used by organizations engaged in criminal activities. By conducting a scoping review of 21 empirical studies, a four-dimensional typology of 10 legitimation strategies is developed, clustered by their association with distinct types of legitimacy. The findings propose five mechanisms whereby legitimation strategies impact public opinion. Understanding these strategies and mechanisms is crucial for developing effective counter-strategies to delegitimize criminal actions and enhance societal resilience. This study advances the fragmented discourse on legitimation processes of specifically criminal actions employed by organizations, integrating findings from various disciplines to inform theory and practice.",

          "abstract": "Care is foundational to human development and economic resilience, yet remains largely invisible in economic theory and policy. This paper presents a formal model in which support for redistributive care policies depends on three belief channels: the perceived publicness of care, its productivity, and its prosocial value. The model shows that public coordination reduces variance in received care, increasing the likelihood that vulnerability becomes productive.\nEmpirically, we combine two approaches. First, we analyze World Values Survey data from 25 countries (2017–2022), linking individual attitudes to a novel folktale-based index that captures the cultural salience of care-related virtues versus harm-related vices. Countries scoring higher on this index show greater support for redistributive care; civic participation also plays an independent role. Second, an incentivized framing experiment in Italy reveals that framing care as a private responsibility reduces donations to a pooled care fund by 6–8 percentage points.\nTogether, these findings suggest that institutions and shared narratives jointly shape attitudes toward care. Recognizing care as social infrastructure—and designing time regimes and services that foster trust—may be key to building resilient and inclusive economies.",

          "abstract": "Cultural ecosystem services (CES) are a policy priority under the Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework; however, current approaches either commodify CES through monetary valuation or rely on plural, non-comparable metrics, leaving use and experiential quality poorly captured. We propose the subjective quality of personal time—how “well spent” or “wasted” moments feel in a place—as a universal, scalar indicator of CES use. We outline practical routes to measurement via participatory mapping (PPGIS), lightweight experience sampling, and passive digital traces, and show how geosocial collaborative filtering can translate ratings into place-based recommendations. Reframing CES as the increment to time quality provided by the environment resolves the tension between monetary valuation and non-monetary pluralism, yielding a single, comparable metric that remains grounded in lived experience. A proposed PPGIS 2.0 workflow can collect time-quality ratings, tag activities and landscape settings, and return immediate, personalised recommendations, creating continuous data streams rather than one-off surveys. Integration with remote sensing and existing mobility datasets enables mapping of CES potential where participatory data are sparse. A time-quality metric makes CES visible, comparable and actionable across contexts, aligning monitoring with the Global Biodiversity Framework and supporting transformative, people-centred decisions. It offers a generic, accessible message for non-specialists: manage places based on the quality of the time they enable, not merely the quantity of visits, and use participatory, data-driven tools to recommend, protect, and enhance those experiences.",

          "authors": "Harry J Wilson",
          "abstract": "As one of 26 nations off-track from the global health sector goals, the concentrated epidemics of HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs in Bangladesh have proven difficult to control. Female sex workers (FSWs) are the largest key population group in Bangladesh and contextually imperative to deescalate epidemic momentum. This investigation rationalizes the structural, symbolic and interpersonal violence experienced across the life course of Bangladeshi FSWs. The population characteristics of low educational attainment and high marital separation are contextualized through a structural violence of embodied inequality perspective that substantiates the influence of childhood marriages that push Bangladeshi women into the sex trade. Bourdieu's theory of symbolic violence is used to conceptualize the material harms derived from the portrayal of FSWs as fallen women divorced from the virtuous ideals of the normative gender identity. The analysis contends that the intersections of structural and symbolic violence act to legitimize and perpetuate interpersonal assaults that oppress the body, suppress the voice and repress the spiritual soul of FSWs in Bangladesh. These sociostructural complexities pragmatically challenge the individualized perspectives of biobehavioral research that monitor the effectiveness of proximal interventions designed to correct recidivistic behaviors. The underlying role of social-collectivism in dismantling violent architecture and improved condom negotiation capacity behind structural shifts in sexual risk behaviors among Bangladeshi FSWs are emphasized to evidence the importance of empowering approaches in pursuit of transformative biobehavioral change.",

This essay\nargues for a more fundamental starting point: affect, and specifically the primary motivator of\ninterest-excitement. Following the work of psychologist Silvan Tomkins, we posit that interest is the engine of all human action—the force that directs attention, fuels curiosity, and makes\nlearning and creation possible . Its opposite is not irrationality, but interruption—a motivational collapse experienced as profound confusion. This framework reveals that economic expansion is a function of cultivated interest, while contraction and alienation are the results of its systemic interruption. We argue that the painful social experience of economic humiliation is the consequence of a system that generates chronic interruption at the core of motivation. By reframing economics as the science of human attention, we can move beyond abstract models and toward.a discipline capable of addressing the systemic humiliation and motivational collapse that plague modern economic life.",

          "abstract": "Electoral accountability is a cornerstone of democratic governance, yet whether voters effectively punish corruption remains theoretically and empirically contested. While canonical models predict that corruption revelations reduce incumbent support, strategic voting considerations—especially beliefs about others’ behavior—can yield ambiguous accountability outcomes. We exploit a major corruption scandal involving Japan’s ruling party during a national election to examine how social information shapes electoral responses to misconduct. In a pre-registered field experiment, we randomly provided voters with information about prevailing social norms of intolerance toward the scandal. This intervention significantly increased overall turnout and challenger support, particularly among swing voters, consistent with enhanced accountability. Yet the same treatment increased incumbent support among ruling-party loyalists. We show that these heterogeneous effects are systematically driven by voters’ prior beliefs about others’ voting intentions: those expecting others to punish sanctioned more when learning they would not, whereas those expecting tolerance defended more when learning others would punish. These findings reconcile conflicting evidence on electoral accountability by showing how strategic considerations fundamentally shape democratic sanctioning, and suggest that information campaigns can either strengthen or undermine accountability depending on the distribution of voter expectations, with important implications for anti-corruption interventions.",

Stories may be viewed as characters interacting and evolving over time, making an understanding of characters key to understanding stories. Moreover, representation of real people by characters in fictional stories affects how people live their lives:\n\nFictional characters matter because real character matters.\n\nHere, we determine the essential dimensions of the space of fictional characters in film, television, and literature. We draw on a data set comprising 464 crowd-sourced semantic-differential traits scored for 2000 characters across 341 stories.\n\nOn performing dimensional reduction and studying the alignment of traits and characters, we find that twelve archetypes afforded by six essential dimensions dominate the makeup of characters.\n\nWe interpret these six dimensions as three primary dimensions expressed as semantic differentials of base archetypes:\n\n1. {Fool ⇔ Hero},\n2. {Angel ⇔ Demon},\n3. {Traditionalist ⇔ Adventurer};\nand three secondary dimensions:\n4. {Lone Wolf ⇔ Diva},\n5. {Outcast ⇔ Sophisticate},\n6. {Brute ⇔ Geek}.\n\nWe find that the three primary dimensions of character space are congruent with the three dimensions of essential meaning:\n1. {weak ⇔ powerful},\n2. {safe ⇔ dangerous},\nand\n3. {structured ⇔ unstructured}.\n\nWe also observe that the ‘Big Five’ personality traits are covered by these six essential dimensions, showing that fictional characters, however outsized, reflect everyday people.\n\nIn considering combinations of the six essential dimensions, we generate an expanded set of 232 archetypes (e.g., Traditionalist-Demon-Hero ). We perform a detailed analysis of the resulting collection of archetypes for characters and stories.\n\nWe construct an allotaxonograph for comparing pairs of characters. Our map-and-list visualization is a generalization of the standard correlation coefficient, and has broad applicability to system comparisons.\n\nWe provide a comprehensive set of appendices and an interconnected online card collection which together offer explorations of ranked lists of traits, characters, and archetypes; character maps in archetype space for each story; and individual cards for stories, traits, characters, and archetypes.\n\nOur empirical discovery of 12 base archetypes advances the basic science of stories, while offering an analytic framework for the development of new narratives.",

Compared to parents, childfree adults had significantly fewer close relationships, especially in middle age. Additionally, on average, a minority (44%) of childfree adults' close relationships were with parents, while a majority (62%) of parents' close relationships were with other parents. The differences between childfree adults and parents in the number and composition of their close relationships are modest, but call for further research on this gap's implications for childfree adults' well-being and risk of lower social support.",

Those who remain, including African descendants and Indigenous, continue to be seen as unable to attain the education or class status that would give them access to the “fruits of modernity” and are thus excluded from the opportunity to become equal citizens. What is critically important to our understanding of these processes is that they are not limited to “settler” societies like the US, Canada and Australia. Both settler colonial and European countries have histories of dehumanizing those who would come to their countries. The underlying question that I’m trying to address in this article is, what are the key factors driving the development of countries into nation-states with their current day immigration policies, and how those developments are impacted by historical processes of racialization. Theories that try to explain global migration flows often focus on South to North or South-South migration – however, a more global approach needs to include North-South migration that has impacted the development of countries throughout the Western hemisphere (and beyond).",

          "abstract": "Cultural ecosystem services (CES) are a policy priority under the Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework; however, current approaches either commodify CES through monetary valuation or rely on plural, non-comparable metrics, leaving use and experiential quality poorly captured. We propose the subjective quality of personal time—how “well spent” or “wasted” moments feel in a place—as a universal, scalar indicator of CES use. We outline practical routes to measurement via participatory mapping (PPGIS), lightweight experience sampling, and passive digital traces, and show how geosocial collaborative filtering can translate ratings into place-based recommendations. Reframing CES as the increment to time quality provided by the environment resolves the tension between monetary valuation and non-monetary pluralism, yielding a single, comparable metric that remains grounded in lived experience. A proposed PPGIS 2.0 workflow can collect time-quality ratings, tag activities and landscape settings, and return immediate, personalised recommendations, creating continuous data streams rather than one-off surveys. Integration with remote sensing and existing mobility datasets enables mapping of CES potential where participatory data are sparse. A time-quality metric makes CES visible, comparable and actionable across contexts, aligning monitoring with the Global Biodiversity Framework and supporting transformative, people-centred decisions. It offers a generic, accessible message for non-specialists: manage places based on the quality of the time they enable, not merely the quantity of visits, and use participatory, data-driven tools to recommend, protect, and enhance those experiences.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: This study aims to systematically examine the role of technological innovation in advancing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), identifying both general-purpose and goal-specific technologies that drive progress.\nDesign/methodology/approach: Drawing on patent data from the PatentSight database (2015–2024), we construct an SDG–technology mapping matrix covering 100 technology categories across 13 SDGs. We develop and apply the Technology Contribution Index (TCI), which integrates coverage, patent volume, diversity, and contribution intensity. Additionally, cosine similarity is applied to capture interlinkages among SDGs.\nFindings: The results reveal marked heterogeneity in technological engagement across the SDGs. SDG 09 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), SDG 07 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and SDG 13 (Climate Action) dominate in portfolio size and form a tightly interconnected cluster, whereas socially oriented goals such as SDG 05 (Gender Equality) and SDG 01 (No Poverty) remain weakly supported by patents. Large-scale, general-purpose technologies (e.g., Advanced Manufacturing, Blockchain, Internet of Things) provide broad systemic support across multiple SDGs, while specialized technologies (e.g., Clean Cooking, Sex-Disaggregated Data Management) play indispensable roles in individual goals. These findings highlight the coexistence of systemic platforms and niche drivers in the global innovation ecosystem.\nResearch limitations:Patent data may underrepresent non-technological contributions to socially oriented SDGs (e.g., equity, education, institutional reform), which rely more heavily on policy, cultural, or behavioral interventions.\nPractical implications: The TCI framework offers a tool for policymakers to prioritize investment in enabling technologies with broad spillover effects, while also promoting targeted support for niche innovations to address technology gaps in under-supported SDGs.\nOriginality/value: By integrating patent analytics with the SDGs framework, this study introduces a novel quantitative approach—the TCI—for systematically identifying key enabling and goal-specific technologies. The findings enrich the literature on sustainable development and innovation policy, and provide actionable insights for aligning science, technology, and innovation (STI) strategies with the 2030 Agenda.",

          "authors": "Dariia Davydova; Dina Shulyatyeva",
          "abstract": "In this article the author examines narrative coincidence, which can be found in 19th–20th century narratives as well as contemporary ones. Among the variety of contemporary non-linear narrative forms, the forking-path narrative is of special interest, as it encourages the reader to follow not just one life of the protagonist, but several at the same time. The character is unaware about the existence of these other lives, but the reader is aware of them: this difference in knowledge is further emphasized by the fact that in this type of narrative, the events in the happenings do not necessarily coincide with the reception events (in P. Huhn’s terms). The differences in the functioning of the two types of events are also manifested through how coincidence is used in a forking-path narrative: unlike in traditional narratives, coincidences now operate not at the level of the fabula, but at the level of reader perception. From a plot/fabula perspective, the storylines remain autonomous, while from the point of view of the reader’s perception they are connected, intersecting, intertwined. The conflict of the event in the narrated happenings and the reception event is considered on the example of the forking-path novel 4 3 2 1 by P. Auster. In the forking-path narrative coincidences no longer ensure the creation of a clear, coherent, ordered world, but instead create the effect of disorientation, unpredictability and disorder. The primary narrative emotion involved in this type of text therefore becomes “surprise” (whereas the other two, according to M. Sternberg, “suspense” and “curiosity”, turn out to be secondary).",

          "authors": "Dariia Davydova; Maria Levina",
          "abstract": "In many of Boris Pasternak’s early poems, the influence of Igor Severyanin (I. V. Lotarev) can be detected. Even their contemporaries noted that Pasternak used themes, motifs and stylistic features of the older poet. Nevertheless, as is known, Pasternak very often rewrote his poems. While reworking the early texts, Pasternak tried to partially free them from Severyanin’s imagery and style or to incorporate Severyanin’s individual techniques into his own poetics. This article shows how Pasternak changed his approaches to Severyanin’s works in two versions of Marburg — from 1916 and from 1928. In the poem’s later redaction, Pasternak, striving for “simplification”, rejected Severyanin’s “bourgeois” words and “salon” imagery that were present in the earlier version. The article classifies the ways Pasternak drew on Severyanin according to the methodology of philologist Natalia Fateeva. In the early redaction of the poem, one can notice the use of such types of intertextuality as metatextuality, borrowing of a device, sound-syllabic and morphemic types of intertext, as well as poetic paradigm. Examination of “traces” of Severyanin’s poetics in Pasternak’s work requires further study, which could provide a unified understanding of the evolution of Pasternak’s poetry in general and the topic “Pasternak and Severyanin” in particular.",

          "authors": "Dariia Davydova; Veronika Altashina",
          "abstract": "Diderot devoted more than twenty years (1759–1781) to his work as an art critic, he wrote not only nine reviews of exhibitions, but also a number of important aesthetic treatises. The philosopher himself considered the “Salons” to be the best of everything he wrote. The article is devoted to the specifics of verbal representation of the visual in the “Salons”, where the author uses a variety of stylistic, dramatic, narrative techniques. It is the artistic features that make the “Salons” an outstanding work not only in the field of art criticism, but also in literature: Diderot creatively uses all the possibilities of verbal communication, inventing new forms of poetic interpretation of painting. Based on three essays devoted to the paintings of J.-B. Greuze, “The Young Girl Grieving Over Her Dead Bird” (1765), J. O. Fragonard, “Coresus Sacrificing Himself to Save Callirhoe” (1765), and C.-J. Vernet’s “Walking” (1767), the article analyzes various forms of demonstratio ad oculos: dialogue, metalepsis, fantasy, parergon and hypotyposis, all of which allowed Diderot to create “living pictures” that he sought to embody in his innovative dramatic system simultaneously with the “Salons”. He turns to a variety of genres: dialogue, tragedy (Fragonard), erotic libertine novel and bourgeois drama (Greuze), promenade (Vernet). Analysis of the dramatic and philosophical treatises of the French enlightener allows us to see the integrity and systematicity of his thoughts on art and show the connection with the ideas of the era presented in the works of Kant and Lessing. Diderot’s “Salons” combine painting, literature and philosophy into a single whole.",

          "abstract": "The article examines self-repetitions in Molière’s comedies in terms of their thematic focus. The research material were two late comedies by the French playwright — “Les Femmes savantes” (The Learned Ladies, 1672) and “Le Malade imaginaire” (The Imaginary Invalid, 1673), as well as other plays based on Molière’s original version of a love story related to a forced marriage. Analysis of the reuse of images, techniques, and dialog schemes showed that the playwright was constantly transforming them. This helped him to shift the love affair away from the center of the plot and focus it on the character of one of the parent protagonists, whose obsessive manias reflected significant components of French culture of the 17th century — erudition and gallantry. Supporting this new theme with the help of repetitions, Molière gradually moved away from the reduced farcical comedy towards strengthening the satirical treatment of those manifestations of erudition and gallantry that gave rise to ridiculous imitations and turned into their opposite. The results of the study allow us to conclude that self-repetitions, being connected with rhetorical canons and theatrical pragmatics, largely manifested Moliere’s constant reflection concerning the tasks of comedy and contributed to the transformation of the genre towards a greater determination of his images by the manners and mores of the epoch.",

In this study we tested evolutionary theories of human cooperation in a real-world social dilemma: joint liability microfinance, in which groups of borrowers must cooperate to successfully repay a shared loan. We used pre-registered Bayesian multilevel models to estimate meta-analytic associations between loan repayment and proxies of four evolutionary mechanisms proposed to support cooperation: relatedness, reciprocity, partner choice, and punishment. A systematic search of the microfinance literature yielded 73 effect estimates for 11 proxies of evolutionary mechanisms analysed in 11 separate meta-analyses. Punishment-based variables showed the strongest positive meta-analytic associations with loan repayment, with mixed results for other mechanisms. However, estimates varied widely in their certainty, with generally high levels of between-study heterogeneity. Our results provide some evidence for evolutionary mechanisms supporting cooperation in real-world contexts, but also indicate there are non-generalisable findings and/or reproducibility issues in the microfinance literature.",

          "abstract": "They analyze decentralization in different areas, naturally considering fiscal decentralization, political-administrative decentralization, judicial decentralization, and legislative decentralization. Thus, the evidence shows precisely that the current unitary system adopted by Angola tends to channel a large part of the institutions towards marked and widespread failure. On the other hand, there is institutional failure related to the shortcomings of public policies determined by the authorities, whose institutional regime is still centralized. On the other hand, these institutions tend not to guarantee, for example, greater political diversity and greater democratic plurality. Therefore, I particularly propose inclusion through decentralization by means of a federalist model, considering the transformation of the current republic into a Federation of Angolan States. Examples of countries that have adopted the federalist model show the great capacity for transformation provided by federalist decentralization. Above all, fiscal decentralization has the capacity to plausibly associate economic transformations with judicial and legislative transformations in institutions. Angola, particularly with a federalist model, could provide structural and regional balance. For example, the regions could drive sustainable regional economic development with greater rigor, while public finances could optimize fiscal policy and budgetary policy could converge with medium- and long-term objectives. Thus, through a federalist model, economic transformations tend to be inclusive, especially based on institutional dynamics and sustainable growth. The federalist model I propose takes into account the preservation of ethno-linguistic groups through geographical continuity, with the preservation of subnational units and the inclusion of a new state with the capacity to become the future federal capital of Angola.",

In this approach, I seek to highlight some evidence that contributes to the failure of the Angolan economy to prosper. Much of this evidence points to the strong contribution of political, administrative, and fiscal centralization to high levels of multidimensional poverty. The past five decades have promoted vicious circles that have contributed to the ability to generate wealth on a private basis. On the other hand, the significantly exclusive institutions that exist have led the economy to stagnation with a strong dependence on international markets, whose economy, lacking the capacity for transformation, has become an economy of expectations based on these markets in particular. On the other hand, the inability to govern naturally reveals the main driver of stagnation in marked underdevelopment, being strongly associated with the inability to generate wealth for the majority.",

Using the case of RiverBot, a water chatbot reframed from a technical expert to a relational guide, the article shows how discomfort, reflexive practice, and community accountability can serve as evidence and design principles. WBK functions as both recipe and practice, with five guiding actions (indicators, processes, guideposts, implementation, evaluation) and six ingredients (relational stance, somatic attunement, reflexive accountability, narrative methods, ethical data practices, iterative praxis cycles). Together, these elements create a flexible yet rigorous methodology that responds to urgent calls for ethical and novel approaches in technology, research, and application, leading to transformational change. WBK is particularly applicable to the field of emergent technologies for societal good and is offered as an applicable yet evolving framework towards sciences that are accountable, situated, and whole.",

This essay\nargues for a more fundamental starting point: affect, and specifically the primary motivator of\ninterest-excitement. Following the work of psychologist Silvan Tomkins, we posit that interest is the engine of all human action—the force that directs attention, fuels curiosity, and makes\nlearning and creation possible . Its opposite is not irrationality, but interruption—a motivational collapse experienced as profound confusion. This framework reveals that economic expansion is a function of cultivated interest, while contraction and alienation are the results of its systemic interruption. We argue that the painful social experience of economic humiliation is the consequence of a system that generates chronic interruption at the core of motivation. By reframing economics as the science of human attention, we can move beyond abstract models and toward.a discipline capable of addressing the systemic humiliation and motivational collapse that plague modern economic life.",

Drawing on participant observation during the 2025 election season, we show that legitimacy at the grassroots hinged less on institutional reforms than on fragile performances of recognition, care, and reciprocity. Residents judged leaders through culturally resonant idioms like malasakit (concern), pagpapakita (visible presence), and loob (moral intent), evaluating sincerity and intent in everyday encounters. We conceptualize these dynamics as mutual recognition, moralized care, and the fragility of reciprocity, extending debates on trust, legitimacy, and affective governance. While reformist politics reshaped expectations and closed off older forms of patronage, they did not displace the cultural grammars of recognition through which authority is continually made and unmade. Authority in Pasig was therefore both durable and reversible, highlighting reciprocity as a constitutive feature of Philippine democracy.",

          "authors": "Ishan Durve",
          "abstract": "As global retirement ages rise in response to financial insecurity, demographic shifts, and increased life expectancy, questions emerge about how these changes affect the quality of later life. While much research has focused on the economic sustainability of delayed retirement, fewer studies have examined whether retiring at or after the statutory age impacts subjective well-being in comparison to early retirement. This study addresses that gap by investigating whether retirement timing, specifically early versus at statutory-age, shapes quality of life in later years. Using cross-sectional data from Wave 7 of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), retired individuals aged 50 and over were focused upon. The CASP-19 scale (Control, Autonomy, Self-Realisation, Pleasure), a validated measure of older adults’ quality of life based on control, autonomy, self-realisation, and pleasure, was used as the central outcome variable. Using non-parametric statistical comparisons and unsupervised clustering techniques, differences in CASP scores and associated social, financial, and health variables between early and timely retirees were examined. Analysis reveals that early retirees, despite potentially shorter working lives, tend to report better quality of life, particularly in the autonomy and pleasure subscales of CASP. Additionally, we identify distinct post-retirement profiles through cluster analysis, highlighting the importance of relational closeness and financial preparedness in shaping subjective well-being. This study contributes to ongoing debates in social gerontology by offering a nuanced understanding of how retirement timing intersects with psychosocial outcomes in later life. As policies increasingly favour later retirement, these findings underscore the need to consider not just economic sustainability but also the lived experience and perceived quality of life of older adults.",

Here we reflect on learnings from an eight-year, community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership in British Columbia, Canada that addressed the ongoing public health emergency of toxic drug-related deaths in a semi-urban and rural setting. This challenging research context provides a methodological petri dish from which to examine common ethical challenges inherent in CBPR work. Here we discuss how praxis aligned with the concepts of relationality, embeddedness and embodiment contain both tension and promise in complex research contexts. We depict how relational authenticity was facilitated by flexibility and informal interactions and was further enhanced by deeply-engaged, physical presence that enkindled hope even when hope was hampered by limited agency. We also present commensality as a promising methodological tool.",

          "abstract": "The article examines the political doctrine of Kang Youwei (1858–1927), as set out in his treatise Wu zhi jiu guo lun (“An Essay on National Salvation through Material Upbuilding”), written in Canada in 1905 and published in 1908. While in exile after 1899 and declaring himself a modern-day Confucius, Kang Youwei carefully studied the history of the West and the political systems of contemporary European countries and the United States. The main content of the treatise is a search for the source of the power of Western imperialist powers in order to apply this experience to China. Kang Youwei came to the conclusion that Western countries “became powerful thanks to phenomenal progress in science and technology; China must achieve the same level of progress in order to survive and prosper.” There are two main reasons for the West’s superiority over China: national science and the “doctrine of the material.” By “material” Kang Youwei meant modern industrial technologies and the social realities of a globalizing world. At the center of Kang Youwei’s concept is the idea of freedom, which, like all others, he considered historically relative and dependent on the political system of the “current century.” The Chinese thinker claimed that the liberal concept of freedom imposed by Western imperialists is a product of the “feudal-slave system in Europe,” while the Chinese social system provides the vast majority of the population with basic rights and freedoms that are not suppressed by the state. The Western concept of freedom is legal, not philosophical and ideological, and contradicts human nature as interpreted by Chinese philosophical teachings. Speaking about the French Revolution, Kang Youwei emphasized that it liberated the people from oppression by the monarch but did not contribute to the ethical development of ordinary people. In China, the first thinker to raise the issue of social freedoms was Confucius, who also formulated the golden rule of morality. However, the availability of rights and freedoms is limited by the era of social development: Confucius lived in the Era of Chaos, and his teaching is adapted to its realities, determined by the flow of Tao. The Japanese adaptation of the Western interpretation of freedom during the Meiji Revolution was a great mistake of Japanese reformers and may be repeated in China, turning the country onto a path of development not dictated by the nature of Chinese society.",

          "abstract": "The main task of this study is to determine the time of the emergence of the palace institution in the ancient Kingdom of Qin during the Spring and Autumn period (8th–5th centuries BCE) within a broader framework regarding the genesis of statehood in Qin. Here the main obstacle lies in distinguishing the moment of the emergence of Qin’s ruling clan, as well as the genesis of Qin’s main ethnic groups and archaeological culture that existed on Qin’s territory, from the moment of state formation as opposed to the other two, since all three of these phenomena emerged at different times. Thus, the task is to distinguish state institutions from those created and accompanied by kinship relations, to separate clan institutions from the political ones. The first political institution of statehood that can be reliably distinguished from kinship institutions is the palace, which is why it is important to determine the moment of its emergence and to describe the early stages of its development. The study concludes that the palace institution appeared in Qin no earlier than 697 BCE, and by 620 BCE its development entered a phase of specialization whereby its temple functions were separated from its palace functions.",

          "authors": "Dariia Davydova; Timur Safin",
          "abstract": "The “Pan Geng” chapter of the “Book of Documents” is a unique example of an ancient Chinese text that portrays a king (Pan Geng) giving a speech to a large audience. With the oldest layers of the text probably dating back to the XI–VI cent. B. C., the language of the “Pan Geng” is in many instances abstruse, leading to multiple different interpretations of some of its passages. The hypothesis underlying my research is that in some cases, the interpreter’s choice may be affected by the need to portray Pan Geng as a “good king”, but there is a huge discrepancy between the interpreter’s “good” and the archaic Chinese aristocracy’s “good”. Through grammatical analysis and textual parallels I intend to provide an alternative reading for some of the passages, namely: “Let none of you dare to suppress anything that the small people say in remonstrance” &gt; “Let none of you dare to admit what small people criticize”; “Toiling for your forefathers” &gt; “Rewarding your forefathers”; “If the state is not good, it is because I, the One Man, commit mistakes and crimes” &gt; “If the state is not good, it is because I, the One Man, have failed in applying the punishments” (the latter option, proposed by B. Karlgren, has not yet been accepted by Russian interpreters); “Do I overawe you? (No), by this I take care of and sustain you all” &gt; “Do I not overawe you? [I should, for] by this I take care of and sustain you all”.",

          "abstract": "Background\nCanada’s OHIP+ program, implemented in 2018, provided free comprehensive prescription drug coverage to individuals under 25. Given that youths face elevated risks of suicide-related behaviors (SRBs) and frequently encounter cost-related barriers to accessing mental health medications, this study evaluated whether OHIP+ impacted emergency department (ED) visits for SRBs among Ontario youth aged 19–24.\n\nMethods\nWe used linked data from the 2016 Canadian Census and the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System, identifying SRB-related ED visits between April 2016 and March 2020. A single interrupted time series (ITS) and a comparative ITS (CITS) with Coarsened Exact Matching were employed to assess changes in SRB-related ED visits associated with the implementation of OHIP+. The CITS compared low- versus high-socioeconomic status (SES) youths, based on the assumption that low-SES youths are more likely to benefit from public drug coverage due to greater financial barriers.\n\nResults\nOHIP+ implementation was associated with an immediate reduction of 9.4 SRB-related ED visits per 100,000 youth per month (95% CI: -18.2 to -0.6). In the CITS analysis, low-SES youth experienced a significantly greater reduction compared to high-SES youth (difference: -19.6; 95% CI: -37.7 to -1.5). Sex-stratified models indicated that these effects were driven primarily by reductions among females.\n\nConclusion\nPublic drug coverage through OHIP+ was associated with a significant reduction in ED visits for suicide-related behaviors, particularly among low-income and female youth. Our findings underscore the potential of pharmacare to reduce acute mental health crises and promote health equity among vulnerable youth populations.",

          "abstract": "A publication is meaningful in different ways. It is more than objective materiality. A writer sees in a book a great achievement within a tradition of thinking. The corresponding reader finds in the same publication a hermeneutic device. For public discourse, the latest bestselling crossover book provides handy information to special interest readers. To philistine management, a publication is formal authorship in a research assessment exercise. And to varying degrees, all four such personas come together in the ordinary scholar, making the different types of meaning an imbricated whole. In this article, I provide a language for this meaningfulness. I make use of the structural hermeneutics of cultural sociology to demonstrate four key notions of meaning. This language helps to understand the way humanities scholars and other actors in contemporary academia deal with publications. I further illustrate what these abstract notions mean in practice with the recent monograph Also a history of philosophy by Jürgen Habermas.",

          "abstract": "How can resonance in the reception of poetry be understood sociologically? How does the subjective response to poetic works relate to more general social and symbolic structures? I combine Hartmut Rosa’s Resonance Theory with a cultural sociological perspective to illustrate how vertical spheres of resonance—art, nature, religion, or history—can be understood as structures of meaning. I demonstrate how actors transformatively adapt (anverwandeln) a segment of the world to sustain personal meaning and the possibility of resonance. Using Tomas Tranströmer’s poetry as a case study, I demonstrate how poetic reception embodies core elements of resonance—affect, self-efficacy, transformation, and uncontrollability. The cultural sociological reading of Resonance Theory helps to explain the broader cultural dynamics at play. Reception, thus, can be understood as a continuous process in which poetic work becomes a dialogue that reshapes both reader and text. I focus on three phenomena of reception: meaningfulness of form, elemental significance, and uncontrollability of the author’s voice. Ultimately, the case study reveals how poetry, as an iconic medium for existential inquiry, can foster a contemplative relationship to the world—one that resists the instrumentalization of modern society.",

          "abstract": "How can we hear the voice of American civil society in works of art? Civil society relies on solidarity—but when artistic expression becomes overly bound to solidarity’s demands, it may risk losing aesthetic complexity and collapsing into activist moralizing. How does contemporary American literary fiction navigate this tension? This article explores the question by combining a cultural sociological perspective on civil society with a close reading of Colson Whitehead’s work and his trajectory as a writer. I trace two transformations—of both the writer and his literary aesthetic—situating them in the broader social and political context, particularly the rise and fall of the symbolism of Post-blackness. Through an interpretive analysis of The Intuitionist, The Underground Railroad, and The Nickel Boys, I show how Whitehead’s increasing moral engagement paradoxically silences the very voice of civil society he seeks to amplify. This aesthetic shift reflects wider developments in the contemporary relationship between art and activism: as the public court of opinion falters—most visibly during Trump-era politics—art is increasingly compelled to abandon disinterestedness and assume a direct, urgent civil voice.",

Esta investigación examina cómo integran la IA los medios de comunicación del País Vasco, con el objetivo de conocer las prácticas innovadoras que desarrollan en este ámbito y comprender su impacto en las distintas fases del trabajo periodístico. Para ello, se ha adoptado una metodología mixta que combina entrevistas en profundidad a nueve responsables de seis medios vascos con una encuesta a 504 periodistas y profesionales en activo. El análisis se ha estructurado según las tres fases clásicas del proceso periodístico: búsqueda de información, producción de contenido y distribución. Los resultados muestran una adopción cauta de la IA en el plano informativo, pues su uso se orienta principalmente a tareas auxiliares, como la transcripción automática, la corrección de textos o la traducción. Aunque se han identificado iniciativas experimentales innovadoras por parte de los medios, como la clonación de voz en productos narrativos, estas se han desarrollado en contextos periféricos y no informativos. Asimismo, pese al incipiente desarrollo de estrategias corporativas, normativas internas y aplicaciones propias, la implementación de la inteligencia artificial continúa dependiendo en gran medida de las soluciones ofrecidas por las grandes plataformas tecnológicas y de la iniciativa individual de los profesionales.\n\n[EN] Artificial intelligence (AI) is profoundly transforming work in the media sector, reshaping not only production routines but also professional profiles and the internal organisation of newsrooms.

To this end, a mixed-methods approach was adopted, combining in-depth interviews with nine professionals from six Basque media organisations and a survey of 504 active journalists and media professionals. The analysis was structured around the three classic phases of the journalistic process: information gathering, content production, and distribution. The findings reveal a cautious adoption of AI in news related activities, as its use is primarily focused on auxiliary tasks such as automatic transcription, text editing, or translation. While some innovative experimental initiatives have been identified —such as voice cloning in narrative products— these have mostly emerged in peripheral, non-news contexts.

          "abstract": "Theories of legislative politics have long emphasized how a policy's traceability---whether and how voters connect legislative action with policy effects---shapes political incentives to legislate. Arnold (1992) emphasized how the ``nature of the causal chain that links a policy instrument with its policy effects” structures the logic of congressional action. Despite its prominence, this key theoretical claim has received little empirical attention. In this article, we use two survey experiments to test how several policy attributes - including traceability - shape legislators and public policy preferences. We find that elites are responsive to both policy traceability and problem traceability---whether a policy problem itself can be linked to elite actions. By contrast, prospective voters are indifferent to both forms of traceability. With respect to other policy attributes, elites and mass publics share similar preferences. Our results provide support for a previously untested theory of policymaking and describe the nature of strategic decision-making by legislators.",

In a highly powered online experiment, we assess three dark patterns and one transparency-based remedy in decisions involving data protection. Compared to a placebo condition, dark patterns increase the likelihood of choice inconsistency by an effect in the range of 6-12 percentage points, depending on experimental conditions. The transparency-based remedy fails to mitigate these effects. A second study implements the transaction test in a market experiment. Here, one of the treatments from the online experiment increases inconsistency by 42 pp. Two additional deceptive designs are tested, respectively favoring consistent and inconsistent choices. The Dark Pattern version raises inconsistency by 18 pp while the Bright Pattern reduces it by 15 pp. Our findings demonstrate how the transaction test, by providing an empirical assessment of the legal concept of unfairness, offers a flexible tool for the regulation of dark patterns and other commercial practices.",

It argues that batteries should be understood not only as storage technologies but as information devices that translate intermittent renewable flows into commodifiable forms of energy. Through three case studies – of a virtual battery, Bitcoin-as-battery, and a grid storage battery – the paper identifies three modalities of energy: account, waste, and stock. Each exemplifies how valuation practices (accounting, evaluation, valorisation) abstract energy from its material conditions and render it exchangeable within markets. Batteries thus operate as black-boxes in which planetary energies are re-articulated as economic objects, sustaining the commodification of renewables. At the same time, these modalities disclose possibilities for reorienting energy valuation beyond extractive logics. By situating batteries at the intersection of energy and information, the article highlights how the transition to renewables is also a transformation of the knowledge practices that govern energy’s circulation.",

Findings show that Kolintang enriches worship through embodied and communal expressions of faith, nurtures an incarnational and participatory ecclesiology engaging members across generations and denominations, empowers congregations by strengthening identity, and fosters ecumenical dialogue across traditions. Recognition of Kolintang as part of UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage amplifies its significance and situates it within discourses on heritage preservation and cultural sustainability, while offering transferable insights for diasporic and intercultural churches in Asia and Africa. Overall, the study presents a model of contextual ecclesiology that integrates indigenous musical heritage into global theological discourse, demonstrating how churches remain locally rooted while engaging globally.",

          "abstract": "How do consumers react when their favorite product is removed? This paper investigates this question by analyzing individual purchase data from vending machines in Tokyo train stations. We find that the decrease in demand at a consumer’s favorite machine is largely offset by an increase in demand at nonfavorite machines. Surprisingly, demand also increased for products in categories different from that of the removed product. This finding led us to discover that the removal intervention boosted consumer exploration and learning: consumers became more likely to try new products and switch their choices. We posit that prior to the removal, consumers purchased their favorite product at least somewhat out of habit (i.e., an autopilot mode). We also find that high varietyseekers are more likely to choose a substitute at their favorite vending machine, whereas low variety-seekers tend to search for their favorite product at other locations. Although exploration behavior increased uniformly, product switching rose significantly only for low variety-seekers. This suggests that the boosted exploration may mainly benefit high variety-seekers, as it helps them find more products that match their preferences.",

          "abstract": "Despite housing supply shortages in financialised housing markets and acknowledgement of planning application (PA) assessment times as a supply side constraint, reliable and accessible information on PA assessment timeframes is limited. It is in this context that we built a model to predict and explain PA assessment timeframes in New South Wales, Australia. We constructed a dataset of 17,000 PAs (submitted over 3 years) comprising PA attributes, environmental and zoning restrictions, and features derived from PA descriptions using natural language processing techniques. Quantile regression was applied using machine learning modelling to predict probabilistic intervals for assessment timeframes. We then employed an advanced model explanation tool to analyse feature contributions on an overall and individual PA basis. The best performing model, an extreme gradient boosted machine (XGB), achieved an R2 of 0.431, predicting 60.9% of assessment times within one month of actual values. While performance is moderate, the model significantly improves upon previous studies and the current best practice in NSW, which is simply average estimates, by council area, for PA assessment timeframes. The paper concludes by outlining suggestions for further improving model performance and on the benefits of a predictive tool for planners.",

          "abstract": "Under the administrations of the U.S. President Donald J. Trump (2017–2021) and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro (2019–2023), democratic backsliding intensified through institutional erosion, illiberal reforms, and growing political pressures on public administration. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 82 Brazilian and 79 U.S. civil servants, this study examines episodes of moral courage - defined as principled actions taken in the face of political pressure and personal risk. We identify the organizational and individual conditions that enable such acts. At the meso level, we find that supportive professional cultures and strong internal and external networks emerge as key facilitators. At the individual level, moral courage is associated with strong commitment to agency missions, a high sense of self-efficacy, long-term moral reflection, and civic engagement. Additionally, cross-national comparison reveals that Brazilian civil servants tended to mobilize through more collective and visible forms of acts of moral courage, whereas their U.S. counterparts often adopted more individualized and cautious strategies. Our findings contribute to public administration scholarship by offering a comparative perspective on bureaucratic resistance during democratic erosion. We also provide a conceptual framework to guide future empirical research and identify concrete enabling conditions and characteristics that support public servants in defending democratic norms under illiberal regimes.",

To understand the antecedents, mechanisms, and experiences of such relationships, we conducted a multi-methods study to investigate how the perceived human-likeness of social AI chatbots fosters emotional attachment, and how this effect might be mediated via increased user gratifications and heightened chatbot interactions. The quantitative results of our preregistered study with 550 participants from 64 countries showed that perceived human-likeness was a strong driver of attachment. As hypothesized, the results suggested that the effect was mediated by gratifications and interactions. The qualitative analyses demonstrated that social AI chatbots played a special role in the lives of many users, transforming habits, interactions, and relationships. In the words of one participant: \"AI [chatbots] gave me a new life\".",

          "abstract": "It is increasingly recognised that Long Covid may have profound psychosocial implications for children and adolescents, yet systematic reviews have predominantly synthesised findings pertaining to the impact of Long Covid in adults and the COVID-19 pandemic more broadly. This systematic review aimed to synthesise evidence related specifically to the psychosocial impact of Long Covid in children and adolescents. Five academic databases (Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and PsycINFO) were searched for relevant studies using terms related to ‘Long Covid’, ‘children and adolescents’, and ‘psychosocial outcomes’. Grey literature and citation searches were also performed. Quantitative and qualitative studies which estimated the prevalence of, or described, psychosocial outcomes in children and adolescents with Long Covid were included. 41 studies were included, comprising 35 quantitative and six qualitative papers. Five key themes were identified: mental health difficulties, stigma victimisation, and disruption to school functioning, social functioning, and leisure activities. This review lays the groundwork for a new phase of research and practice that regards young people with Long Covid not merely as patients with persistent symptoms but as children, entitled to the same opportunities as their peers, whose developmental, social and emotional needs demand fully equitable attention.",

The\nthree discourses suggest contrasting and complementary understanding of international order.\nNational conservatives aim to morally and politically recast the West. In contrast, Anglo-skeptics\nand neo-Eurasianists abandon this aspiration, instead emphasising greater ‘sovereignty’ and\n‘strategic independence’ for Europe.

Such rejection could lead individuals to look to other relationships for material, social, and psychological support as they grow up. We assess this hypothesis by analyzing data produced from a probability survey of U.S. adults that asked respondents to identify the most important people who raised them. Multinomial logistic regression models find that gay or lesbian individuals are more likely than straight individuals to choose their grandmother as the most important person who raised them. Similarly, gay or lesbian individuals are more likely than straight individuals to choose a non-family member—such as a neighbor or teacher—as the second most important person who raised them. These findings provide support for past research that has mainly used qualitative or non-probability data to examine how sexuality shapes family relationships.",

We compared CL and OLS using descriptive statistics, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), regression models, and subgroup analyses.\nMean CL and OLS scores were similar, but response distributions differed: OLS showed more extreme values and negative skew. In a CFA including other life evaluation measures, both OLS and CL items loaded on a shared life evaluation latent factor, but OLS showed higher loadings. OLS also showed stronger predictive validity than CL across measures of life evaluation, affect, and eudaimonic wellbeing. Subgroup analyses revealed interpretive differences across age, gender, and language groups (English, Spanish, and French).\nBoth CL and OLS are valid indicators of adolescent life evaluation, but they are not interchangeable. OLS may be preferable as a summary measure due to stronger predictive performance, while CL may offer more consistent subgroup comparability.

          "title": "Eco-digital Posthumanism: Definition, Genealogy, and Research Agenda within the EcoAI Framework",
          "authors": "Gianfranco Rubino",
          "abstract": "The concept of Eco-Digital Posthumanism stands as a theoretical horizon within the EcoAI (Rubino, 2025) Framework, envisioning a posthumanist orientation through which humanity, non-human entities, and technological infrastructures co-constitute shared worlds. \nGrounded in a relational ontology, this perspective refuses ontological separations between ‘human’, ‘environment’, and ‘technology’; instead, it frames them as intra-acting, constitutive elements in dynamic assemblages. Drawing on Karen Barad’s notion of intra-action (Barad, 2007), Donna Haraway’s concept of sympoiesis (Haraway, 2016), and Rosi Braidotti’s affirmative ethics of relationality (Braidotti, 2013), Eco-Digital Posthumanism offers a robust ontological and ethical basis for reconsidering human-technology-environment relations as fundamentally entangled.\nThe related EcoAI framework proposes that emergent eco-technologies — including sensing infrastructures, AI-driven environmental monitoring, and digitally mediated communal platforms — are not mere tools, but active mediators that shape both material reality and collective subjectivity. In this light, humans are reconceived as eco-technological intra-agents: their agency is neither purely individual nor detached but arises in dyadic and poly-nodal entanglements with environments and technologies. The ethical imperative intrinsic to this view is to design infrastructures and learning ecologies that foster mutual care, multispecies attentiveness, and distributed co-agency.\nA vital tension animates the formation of the Eco-Digital Humanism theory: on one side, the ecological system demands renewed forms of relationality between humans, environments, places, and presences. This demand emphasizes physical co-presence, material engagement, and practices that re-embed subjectivities in place-based knowledge, embodied awareness, and ecological responsiveness. Here, educational media play a key role: Antonio López defines ecomedia literacy as the critical capacity to comprehend and engage with the reciprocal ecological “footprint” and cultural “mindprint” of media systems (López 2020, DOI:10.4324/9780203731109). This socio-pedagogical pillar grounds the theory in media-ecological practice. It calls for pedagogies and practices that re-embed subjectivities in place-based knowledges, somatic awareness, and ecological attunement.\nOn the other hand, stands the rise of an immaterial relational geographies: social media, algorithmic platforms, influential digital narratives, ephemeral trend dynamics, and hyper-mediated connectivity craft relational spaces that lean toward an individualistic massification which often replace embodied interaction with curated digital self-expression and mediated connectivity with risks of disembedding relationality. These forces often substitute co-present engagement — with its embodied gestures, proxemics, and spontaneous nonverbal communication — with curated digital self-expression and algorithm-driven interaction. The communication shifts from embodied co-construction to performative self-branding, from tangible immediacy to mediated simulacra. José van Dijck and colleagues analyse how these platforms shape public life and values through infrastructural power (van Dijck, Poell &amp; de Waal 2018, DOI:10.23860/MGDR-2018-03-03-08). Moreover, scholars like Couldry and Mejias warn of data colonialism, where personal data are appropriated in ways akin to digital exploitation (Couldry &amp; Mejias 2019, DOI:10.1177/1527476418796632). These critical sociological perspectives highlight how algorithmic systems can erode embodied co-presence and place-based relationality. This tension must be at the heart of Eco-Digital Humanism: it calls for technologies, pedagogies, and AI systems that restore and augment embodied, place-rooted relational ethics, rather than further eroding them.\nEco-Digital Posthumanism therefore envisions a middle path: techno-ecological designs and curricular frameworks that honour the ecological imperative for reciprocity, material co-presence, and affective attunement, while resisting the flattening of relationality that results from algorithmic mass individualism. In this, Eco-Digital Posthumanism embeds both philosophical depth and sociological grounding (López, van Dijck, Couldry &amp; Mejias), extending ecological posthumanism (as developed by Oppermann, 2016;) and material ecocriticism (Iovino &amp; Oppermann, 2014), by providing a mediation-centred, operational lens for guiding education, ethical design, and the governance of AI-mediated environments.\nIn sum, Eco-Digital Humanism posits that humans, non-humans, and technological systems co-create worlds; that ecological instances of sustainability necessitate relational, place-embedded forms of being and that the rising immaterial relational geographies without proper literacy threaten to separate us from those embodied ecologies. The theory thus demands a reconfiguration — through EcoAI Framework — of pedagogy, policy, and design, so that the digital infrastructures serve ecological relationality rather than displace it.",

The effect is primarily driven by White Britons. Path modelling indicates that the ruling indirectly increased prejudice against immigrants ant anti-immigrant party voting intentions.

          "authors": "Charis Papaevangelou; Max van Drunen",
          "abstract": "The growing reliance of journalism on platforms has profoundly affected the political economy of journalism. In response to growing concerns over platforms’ discretionary power over journalism, the EU introduced a legally-binding media privilege’ with its European Media Freedom Act (EMFA), seeking to protect journalistic content from platforms’ unjust content moderation mechanisms. While the EMFA represents a significant affirmation of journalism’s normative value and the need for elevated legal protections, this article identifies a fundamental paradox at the core of the regulation: by entrusting critical procedural obligations to platform companies, the EMFA risks entrenching rather than mitigating platforms’ discretionary power over journalism. Using a doctrinal legal analysis of the EMFA, supplemented by a critical evaluation of its platform-press implications and the broader sociopolitical context, we foreground how the EMFA’s procedural reliance on platforms stop it short from realising its normative ambitions regarding journalism’s democratic value. Drawing on interdisciplinary scholarship, we identify two structural reasons for this paradox: the EU’s consistent underestimation of platform firms’ material interests and its misguided faith in procedural fairness and multistakeholder governance models. Ultimately, we contend that structural and not procedural changes are required to effectively protect journalism’s democratic value.",

Its extensive prevalence in low-income countries calls for a reliable method to measure the effectiveness of government expenditure in the area, especially because many countries underperform or overperform on maternal and child health relative to health spending. This review establishes the Basic Health Infrastructure Index (BHII), constructed from normalized indicators of hospital beds, physician and midwifery personnel distribution, as a better matrix towards the predictability of maternal and child health statistics compared to the mere traditional health expenditure as % of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) proxy in determining associations. Results and case studies from 7 countries support the thesis that basic health infrastructure is a vital determinant of constraints, targeting optimizes outcomes, and GDP serves as a context rather than an indicator of reduced maternal mortality and under-5 mortality. This study recommends a three-step investment strategy for low-income countries: ensuring countries meet their determined minimum infrastructure threshold, then layering targeting programs for high-risk populations, followed by monitoring return-on-investment metrics. These are justified by philosophical approaches for the least advantaged.",

Drawing on 41 Australian and international peer-reviewed and grey literature sources, the review identifies pathways of housing loss through economic coercion, safety threats, and actions from abusers that can prevent women from acquiring stable housing. Homeless DV survivors experience heightened trauma, poor mental health, and barriers to help-seeking. The evidence highlights the effectiveness of empowerment-based casework, safe-at-home programs, rental subsidies, and flexible funding in fostering resiliency.

Three dynamics emerge: (1) moralized visibility, where leaders’ presence signals sincerity and authenticity; (2) conditional submission, where compliance is negotiated, reversible, and grounded in fairness; and (3) hybrid accountability, where digital reforms gain legitimacy only when accompanied by relational responsiveness. By foregrounding these everyday practices, the study develops a meso-level framework that complements but also departs from clientelism, coercion, and populism, while engaging perspectives on moral economy and democratic ambivalence.

          "abstract": "How do consumers react when their favorite product is removed? This paper sheds light on this question by analyzing purchase behavior at vending machines in Tokyo train stations, where the majority of machines underwent product changes during our sample period. Using a synthetic difference-in-differences approach, we find evidence of consumers substituting both within and across vending machines. Notably, consumer demand expands at their non-favorite machines, driven not only by purchases of their favorite product but also of other products. Most interestingly, we document increased consumer experimentation: after removal of their favorite product, consumers become more frequently try new products and switch choices, consistent with learning behavior.  This implies that persistent choice of a “favorite” product may partly reflect habit, and its removal can disrupt one’s routines, and prompting exploration. We also show heterogeneous treatment effect by variety-seeking tendency: High variety-seekers are more likely to choose a substitute at their favorite vending machine, whereas low variety-seekers tend to search for their favorite product elsewhere. However, experimentation and learning behaviors are invariant to variety-seeking tendency.",

As devaluation rests on shared cultural beliefs, both demand and supply sides are analyzed. On the demand side, Study 1 applies word embedding–based text analysis to real-world Japanese job ads. On the supply side, Study 2 uses a factorial survey where participants evaluated fictitious job postings. The results suggest that both demand and supply sides share the belief that feminine meanings embedded in job ads—such as stereotypically feminine traits/skills and family-oriented WLB—do not deserve higher compensation.

We then introduce a typology of contemporary modes of engagement—streamlining workflows, scaling up projects, hybrid analytical approaches, and the sociology of computation—alongside rejection of computational analyses. We illustrate these approaches with detailed workflow examples from a large-scale ethnographic study and guidance for solo researchers. We argue for a pragmatic sociological approach that moves beyond dualisms of technological optimism versus rejection to show how computational tools—simultaneously dangerous and generative—can be adapted to support longstanding qualitative aims when used carefully in ways aligned with core methodological commitments.",

          "abstract": "Henry George (1839–1897) was among the most widely read economists of his era,\nyet he has remained a systematically marginalized figure in the subsequent history of economic thought. This essay contends that his influence is indispensable for understanding\nthe conceptual foundations of modern economics—and, in particular, the paradigm\nestablished by John Bates Clark (1847–1938). Clark collapsed land into capital, dissolving it as a distinct factor of production.  This marked a paradigmatic shift, driven by\npolitical pressures rather than scientific reasoning: it was formulated in direct response\nto George’s radical proposal to socialize the economic rent of land. To make this case, the\nessay begins with a methodological critique of orthodox economics through the lens of\nthe philosophy of science, in particular with respect to the definition of capital. George’s\nideas are situated in their historical context, reconstructing his ethical and scientific\nreasoning and his extraordinary, if often overlooked, influence in the Anglo-Saxon world\nand beyond. It concludes by assessing the continuing relevance of George’s insights and\nby exposing the limitations of Clark’s paradigm, which still shapes economic theory and\npolicy today.",

Using the publicly available data from the original study, we reassess the effects of educational signals and ethnic origin. Our analyses show that the original results do not withstand all robustness checks and that theoretically derived effect heterogeneities across occupational fields provide more nuanced explanations.

          "abstract": "This study examined longitudinal associations between caregiver-child dyadic unpredictability, children’s verbal abilities, and externalizing problems, and the moderating role of temperamental surgency. Participants were 235 families with young children (Mage =2.97 years, SD = 0.38, range: [2,4], 55.3% female, ethnicity: 55.2% White, 21.3% African American, 16.2% mixed race). Mother-child dyadic unpredictability measured at wave one was linked to lower verbal development over waves one and two, which was associated with greater increases in externalizing problems over waves one and three. These effects were particularly salient for children with high surgency. In contrast, father-child dyadic unpredictability was linked to greater verbal ability for children with low temperamental surgency, although this finding did not hold after controlling for the variability in child dysregulation during father-child interaction. Furthermore, findings revealed a curvilinear association between father-child dyadic unpredictability in association with the development of children’s verbal ability. The present study has important implications for understanding unpredictability within parent-child interactions and its influence on child development. (©American Psychological Association, 2025.

          "abstract": "Abstract Zhihu.com, as a representative of the Social Question and Answer (SQA) community in China, currently has a very large user base. Experts, scholars and talent from all walks of life are brought together on this network. Compared with other social media websites, the education levels and quality of online users on Zhihu.com are generally high. Young people represent the largest demographic group of users. This dissertation took young people as the research object and analyses their knowledge contribution behaviour in the online SQA community. The study adopted an online observation approach and semi-structured interview methodology. The researcher observed the online knowledge contribution behaviour for an extended period, and conducted in-depth interviews with 25 long-term users. Users were grouped according to gender and age, and the differences in knowledge contribution among these different groups were analysed and compared. The study asked the questions: what characters and personalities do these participants have? Why do participants contribute to the SQA community, and how does contributing to an online SQA forum differ from offline knowledge contributions? Through investigation, the study found that knowledge contributors are enthusiastic and have a strong sense of social responsibility. They are willing to learn and self-motivated. However, even though they may not have a clear purpose in the contribution of knowledge, 6 they help to build their own reputations, broaden social networks and make money eventually. This dissertation attempted to apply Bourdieu’s theory of capital as a framework to explain how users go about accumulating symbolic, economic, cultural and social capital by contributing knowledge. To conclude the study, the researcher drew conclusions concerning the difference between online and offline knowledge contribution on SQA communities.\n\nKeywords: Knowledge Contribution, SQA communities, Social Capital, Prosocial Behaviour",

          "abstract": "Scholarship on journalism in the digital age has often pointed to a gap between audiences’ expectations of journalism and what journalists actually do in their work as one reason for the global decline in news trust and consumption. Much of this work has, however, evolved from studies of journalistic role perceptions to measure audiences’ expectations of these same roles. In line with the so-called audience turn in (digital) journalism studies, this study takes an audience-centric approach to better understand what it is that audiences want, in the hope of better informing journalistic work. Through an analysis of 35 observations and in-depth interviews with audience members in Austria, we examine audiences’ demands, beliefs, and assessments of journalists, and the relations among these expectation modes. Our findings demonstrate the complex nature of audiences’ expectations and reveal seven dimensions. Four of these aligned partially with normative journalistic roles: expectations of (1) information; (2) interpretation; (3) accountability; and (4) activism. The remaining three extend beyond them, including expectations of (5) emotional connection; (6) interaction; and (7) societal relevance. These insights highlight what audiences value in journalism, offering a foundation for news content that caters to their needs.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces Commoning Accessibility (CA) as a new framework for understanding and enabling equitable access to urban services within the context of the 15-minute city (15mC). While the 15mC promotes proximity-based access to everyday amenities, it often overlooks the social and relational processes through which accessibility is produced and maintained. Drawing on emerging debates about commoning mobility and mobilities of care, we argue that accessibility should not be understood merely as a function of spatial proximity or individual mobility, but as a collectively shaped resource that emerges through shared practices, infrastructures, and governance. Inviting for a reflection on a wide range of underexplored community-led initiatives—from shared mobility schemes and care services to locally run facilities—that actively reshape access in ways aligned with the principles of commoning and framing those under the umbrella of CA, the paper propose a new research agenda. The research agenda is structured around five key areas: firstly, mapping enabling conditions for CA practices; secondly, understanding CA practices; thirdly, supporting the development of CA as experiments; fourthly, assessing CA impacts; and fifthly, identifying supportive policy frameworks. With such an agenda, the paper calls for a shift in accessibility planning—from top-down, metric-driven approaches to ones that centre collective agency, everyday interdependencies, and community-led innovation. This reorientation has significant implications for how accessibility is governed, experienced, and sustained in the pursuit of just mobilities.",

          "abstract": "Do place-based interventions that raise visibility and economic activity affect far-right voting? We study the Tour de France (TdF) as a case of brief but highly visible exposure that combines economic activity with symbolic recognition. Using variation in the annual TdF route between 2002 and 2022, we show that exposed municipalities experience declines in far-right support of 0.03–0.04 standard deviations. The effect exceeds 0.1 standard deviations in recent elections and is strongest in poorer areas and in towns with high prior far-right support. We find evidence consistent with the symbolic mechanism and mixed evidence for the economic one. TdF exposure increases local GDP per capita, effects on voting are larger when French riders win stages, and a two-wave survey around the 2025 TdF provides suggestive evidence that residents in exposed towns report greater pride and recognition. These results contribute to research on geographic inequalities, symbolic politics, and the electoral consequences of place-based interventions.",

          "abstract": "Shifting toward plant-based diets is a crucial aspect of mitigating climate change. As part of this transition, growing the plant-based meat and plant-based dairy industries has significant potential to reduce the environmental impacts of food systems in Western countries. To date, little research has examined the systemic challenges faced by stakeholders involved in developing and supporting these industries. By applying a multi-stakeholder perspective, our study addresses this gap in the literature, exploring the drivers and barriers influencing industry growth. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 respondents representing consumers, manufacturers and retailers. Reflexive thematic analysis was applied, identifying seven overlapping themes applicable to both industries. Findings indicate that support for plant-based products is often grounded in sustainability goals and belief that newer plant-based alternatives can effectively meet consumer expectations. However, industry growth is restricted by structural challenges, including the influence of the meat and dairy sector, negative consumer perceptions, and the high financial risk of investing in emerging alternatives. Stakeholders identified two key changes needed: greater industry investment and more effective strategies to stimulate consumer demand. Applying the multi-level perspective (MLP) to interpret findings suggests that the plant-based meat and plant-based dairy sectors are still operating as niche industries, and that sector growth depends on changes at both the niche and regime levels to fully integrate plant-based meat and plant-based dairy into the food system. This research contributes original insights into the dynamics of sustainable food system transformation by foregrounding stakeholder experiences across multiple points in the value chain.",

Interviewer, Ditte Andersen (DA), probes Berman’s argument on how the economic style of reasoning is linked to specific values, especially the value of efficiency, in ways that crowd out other values (e.g. democratic participation, universal rights) and constrain social policy thinking in contemporary Western societies. Social investment policies epitomize the economic style of reasoning by orientating towards returns of public spending. In policy domains such as education, ‘social investment in action’ forefronts the value of returns (in the future) rather than, for example, the value of equality and universalism (in the present). The interview also turns attention to the role of sociologists in denaturalizing the taken for granted and aid the imagination of alternative futures.",

Using large language model–assisted extraction with human oversight, I map which roles dominate across genres and compare them to real-world occupational data. The results show that fiction highlights a narrow set of archetypes---e.g., students, writers, detectives, athletes---while downplaying most everyday forms of labor. Overrepresentation is shaped partly by prestige: higher-status jobs are somewhat more likely to be emphasized, but many exceptions remain, with some prestigious professions underrepresented (e.g., tech executives and engineers) while low-prestige but narratively useful roles (e.g., hunters, antique dealers) are prominent. In romance titles, occupational portrayals diverge sharply by gender: men are written into positions of power, danger, or transgression, while women are more often portrayed in expressive or domestic roles. Comparing these fictional portrayals to survey and dating-app data on occupational desirability reveals consistent gaps, underscoring how cultural products use work as symbolic resources for storytelling and signaling desirability rather than mirroring labor markets.",

          "abstract": "This study introduces the Public-sector Chatbot Performance (PCP) framework, a novel and comprehensive approach to systematically assess AI chatbot performance in public administration. The framework evaluates both technical competence—factual accuracy, completeness, and source reliability—and normative integrity, including lawfulness, transparency, equality, and privacy. To demonstrate applicability of the PCP framework, we benchmark the full set of municipal chatbot systems currently deployed in Dutch local governments, alongside two leading proprietary large language models (LLMs): ChatGPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Using a pragmatic mixed methods approach, we developed 26 prompts with systematic user-based variation to explore algorithmic bias, resulting in a dataset of n=326 user-chatbot interactions. Quantitative analysis revealed that ChatGPT-4o achieved a composite performance score of 95.7%, significantly outperforming all municipal systems. Municipal chatbots exhibited notable shortcomings in competence and integrity, with some failing to meet basic standards of lawful and equal service provision. Exploratory qualitative analysis further uncovered algorithmic opacity, discretionary advice in violation of Dutch good governance regulations, and discriminatory responses based on “ethnic” usernames. These insights challenge assumptions about neutrality in public sector AI and underscore the need for ethical benchmarks in chatbot evaluation. The PCP framework offers actionable guidance for policymakers, technologists, and scholars committed to responsible digital governance.",

          "abstract": "Climate services and co-production efforts aim to support adaptation by making climate information useful and usable. Yet many services and research projects prioritize improving data quality over understanding decision-making needs. This limits insights into what we define as true demand: the actionable need for information that would improve decisions, if conditions allowed. Here, we present a systematic sectoral analysis grounded in behavioral theory exploring whether, where, and how better climate predictions could improve decisions. We apply this approach to two climate-sensitive sectors in Germany: agriculture and forestry. Using expert focus groups (N = 24), we identify key adaptation decisions and analyze current decision strategies. Drawing on the COM-B model for behavior (B) change, we examine the capabilities (C), opportunities (O), and motivation (M) necessary to use climate predictions in practice. Our findings reveal that foresighted adaptation is often constrained by gaps in knowledge, lack of opportunity, or limited motivation. These constraints diminish the perceived importance of climate predictions on the subseasonal to decadal timescale or prevent their use, with decision-makers instead relying on past experience and heuristics such as worst-case planning. Nevertheless, experts expressed interest in improved predictions---particularly for variability and extremes across intra-annual to multi-year timescales---that could inform decisions. True demand may remain masked, blocked, or unexpressed if decision-makers lack the capabilities, opportunities, or motivation to recognize, act on, or articulate it. Our approach provides a systematic way to assess where and how predictions could improve decisions, shifting the focus from better data to better decisions.",

          "abstract": "Almost everything in our modern world is artificial; from cruffins and fish flops, to penicillin and computers. But why are there some-things, rather than no-things? Why is it that humans continue to create things, and is this an inevitable run-away process? In this paper, I explore whether the design process (which leads to all the artificial things in our modern world) is unique to humans, alongside the key attributes which separates humans from non-humans creatures.\n\nI suggest that humans engage in what I describe as functional pretence, an intentional process where one interacts with what one (or another) imagines as real. Functional pretence enables humans to interact with an artificial world which contains all the information and knowledge generated by other humans (similar to Popper’s Third World). Access to this world is what gives rise to all the artefacts and all the artificial in our modern worlds. Functional pretence removes the requirement for direct experience, and enables humans to take a faithful leap toward the novel and the unknown. \n\nAs our modern world contains more knowledge and technologies than ever before. It is valuable to understand what has led to this, alongside what can be done to encourage certain artefacts to be born into existence.",

          "authors": "J. Patrick Williams; Samuel Judah; Rolf Lyneborg Lund; Yu Xie",
          "abstract": "This research note examines the potential of ChatGPT’s large language model for qualitative symbolic interactionist analysis of social media datasets. Using a small sample of 15 posts on mental health issues from the social media platform Reddit, we explore how large language models interpret, organize, and communicate information based on researchers’ prompts. Prompting itself is a process in which researchers provide both a definition of the situation and of relevant identities for a GPT to assume, which directly shape its interpretive capacity and output. We compare ChatGPT-4o, the latest personal subscription version available at the time of writing, and Microsoft AutoGen, a more powerful API version capable of organizing multiple GPT agents to complete research tasks semi-autonomously. We describe and evaluate the structure and content of each model’s output, including how they engage with data thematically, empirically, and conceptually. We also highlight differences in depth and coherence of their analyses. We show how changes to prompts influenced the GPTs’ interpretative actions, yielding both expected and novel analytical insights. Our preliminary findings suggest that GPTs hold promise for advancing qualitative analysis of big data, albeit with some limitations in analytic depth and occasional hallucination errors. The study contributes to nascent symbolic interactionist scholarship on nonhuman agents in qualitative research, positioning GPTs as semi-autonomous research collaborators.",

          "title": "Musical Diversity and Discursive Unity:  Projections of Ethnic and National Identities onto Regional and Classical Musics in Iran",
          "authors": "Kajwan Ziaoddini",
          "abstract": "“This radif that you acquire, is actually the collection, an encyclopedia, of melodies and motives of various local musics through the country.” During ten years of Iranian classical repertoire education known as radif, my mentors used to remind me of the regional roots of each piece and assert the organic relationship between national classical music and local folk musics. Classical-regional music dichotomy is an omnipresent classification of the music in Iran, representing the notions of nationality and ethnicity, respectively. This paper aims to study how the dynamics between nationality and ethnicity in Iran have been reflected in the relationships between classical and regional music. I draw on Maria Sonevytsky’s (2022) and Tanya Merchant’s (2014) study of evolutionism in the former Soviet Union and Rasmus Elling’s study (2015) of the minorities in Iran. Focusing on the mostly Iranian musicologists’ and musicians’ published articles, essays, and interviews as well as my experience in the field as a student of Iranian classical music at the University of Tehran, I argue that the prevalent discourse has conflated the sociopolitical notion of Unity in Diversity with the previously established hierarchical mindset in music such that it resulted in the delineation of a hierarchical order of musical systems. I hope to show how the devastating implications of evolutionism can breach contemporary conceptualizations.",

          "abstract": "Large numbers of experts and laypeople alike were misinformed about police violence data, and supportive of objectively damaging social policies, during the George Floyd riots of 2020. Why? In this paper, we review the evidence for misinformed attitudes about policing and the consequences thereof. We end with a discussion of why false beliefs , with devastating consequences, spread so rapidly in society.",
