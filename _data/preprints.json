          "authors": "Hans de Jonge; Bianca Kramer; Jeroen Sondervan",
          "abstract": "Transformative agreements have become an important strategy in the transition to open access, with almost 1,200 such agreements registered by 2025. Despite their prevalence, these agreements suffer from important transparency limitations, most notably article-level metadata indicating which articles are covered by these agreements. Typically, this data is available to libraries but not openly shared, making it difficult to study the impact of these agreements. In this paper, we present a novel, open, replicable method for analyzing transformative agreements using open metadata, specifically the Journal Checker tool provided by cOAlition S and OpenAlex. To demonstrate its potential, we apply our approach to a subset of publications funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) and its health research counterpart ZonMw. In addition, the results of this open method are compared with the actual publisher data reported to the Dutch university library consortium UKB. This validation shows that this open method accurately identified 89% of the publications covered by transformative agreements, while the 11% false positives shed an interesting light on the limitations of this method. In the absence of hard, openly available article-level data on transformative agreements, we provide researchers and institutions with a powerful tool to critically track and evaluate the impact of these agreements.",

          "title": "When Hypothesis Preregistration Feeds Into Theory Development",
          "authors": "Agata Bochynska; Giosuè Baggio",
          "abstract": "Study preregistrations and theory development have been proposed as independent strategies for improving the quality, transparency, robustness, and reproducibility of research. Yet, a discussion of how theory and preregistration could interact and complement each other towards improved science is currently lacking. Here, we argue that hypothesis preregistration could stimulate theory development by serving various roles, depending on the availability or quality of theories and hypotheses in a field at any given time. We suggest that, in appropriate conditions, preregistration can increase the quality of hypotheses before they are tested, with indirect beneficial effects on theory development. In fields where theories are less developed or agreed upon, or are lacking altogether, hypothesis preregistration can nudge researchers to improve and share their hypotheses, engaging their community and facilitating accumulation and development of hypotheses. As a field’s theories and hypotheses become more advanced and better understood, hypothesis preregistration can become less important: the theory itself can function as a public repository of hypotheses and can constrain methodological aspects of research. We explore possible relations and synergies between hypothesis preregistration and theory development in a range of scenarios. We conclude with a discussion of implications and recommendations for researchers and meta-scientists.",

          "authors": "Khuyen N. Le; Alan Clinton Bale; David Barner",
          "abstract": "In many languages, count nouns trigger a comparison by number (e.g., too many strings), while mass nouns typically do not (e.g., too much string). However, object-mass nouns like furniture exhibit mass syntax but often support a comparison by number (e.g., too much furniture → too many items; Barner &amp; Snedeker, 2005). Some theories argue that object-mass nouns lexically specify individuation, making them semantically like count nouns in that they induce a comparison by number (Bale &amp; Barner, 2009), while others propose that only count nouns force numerical comparisons, leaving object-mass nouns open to contextual shifts (Rothstein, 2017; McCawley, 1975). We evaluated these hypotheses by comparing English quantity judgments for object-mass nouns to (1) collective count nouns, and (2) French judgments for translations of object-mass nouns. In each case, we found that object-mass nouns behaved like count nouns, and were no more susceptible to contextual effects. These findings support the view that object-mass nouns and count nouns specify individuation to the same extent.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Many people apply supernatural explanations to understand the cause of important positive and negative life events, but specific types of events are more likely to evoke specific supernatural explanations that best satisfy various personal motives. We test the hypothesis that believers will differ in their willingness to apply karmic explanations to their own experiences compared to the experiences of other people, such that they are more willing to explain their own positive experiences as caused by their own karmic merit (to satisfy self-enhancement motives), while being more willing to explain other people’s negative experiences as karmic punishment for others’ misdeeds (to satisfy justice motives).\nMethods: In three studies (total N = 2041), we ask participants to recall events believed to have been caused by karma in their own life, and events believed to have been caused by karma in the lives of other people, and we code whether these descriptions of karma-caused events are primarily positive or negative, using a combination of human coders, sentiment analysis, and participants’ self-reported evaluations of the events.\nResults: Results consistently show that positive experiences are more likely to come to mind when they think about how karma influences their own life, but negative experiences are more likely when thinking about other’s karma, although this difference was weaker in Singapore and India than in the United States. \nConclusions: Results are consistent with predicted self-enhancement biases in karmic attributions, and show how personal motivations predict willingness to adopt supernatural explanations for specific life events.",

          "abstract": "Multitasking environments, such as monitoring of multiple underwater drones during live rapid environmental assessment (REA), while performing image classification, require effective cognitive resource management. In this second of two papers, we examine how trust, task-switching demands, workload, auditory environment, affect image classification task performance. We also benchmark a novel machine learning classification algorithm (Bijjahalli et al., 2023) against human performance. Results of our Bayesian multilevel modelling (n=95) found trust in reliable alerts supported task focus but had limited impact on response times. Task-switching interruptions led to a decline in immediate performance, which improved over time, and that image classification accuracy was unaffected by perceived workload, although moderate increases in effort and frustration improved accuracy. We also found that silent operating environments significantly improved image classification accuracy, while female voice alerts were distracting. Machine learning predictions aligned with faster response times and accuracy, supporting their utility in a decision support system.",

          "authors": "Marcel Linka; Benjamin de Haas",
          "abstract": "Salience models for complex scenes typically aim to explain heatmaps or scan-paths. While heatmaps potentially conflate fixations serving different functions, scan-paths aim for a level of detail which is hard to attain. We introduce a novel approach, based on the premise that most fixations target objects and belong to three functionally meaningful classes: Detection fixations (D), foveating an object for the first time; Inspection fixations (I), successively targeting object details; and Return fixations (R), revisiting an object, e.g., to refresh its representation in memory. To test the hypothesis that these classes capture distinct fixation profiles, we reanalysed a large dataset of scene fixations. We computed separate heatmaps for D, I, and R and found significantly higher inter-observer consistency within than between classes. Across fixations landing on different semantic features, the proportion of D, I, and R fixations varied consistently, and a semantic salience model trained to predict each class independently learned diverging distributions of feature weights. Further, we found a shift from D to I and R across viewing time, in line with their functional interpretation and previous findings on ambient and focal viewing modes. We tested and confirmed that the dynamics of this shift varied as a function of trial duration. Finally, we found that the D, I, R classification could be approximated with a simple spatial heuristic, extending its applicability to images without object metadata. We propose the D, I, and R classification as a simple but powerful tool to functionally classify scene fixations and provide well documented code to implement it.",

          "abstract": "Recognition of a word and its meaning benefits from the sensorimotor information about concepts. However, this phenomenon has been underexplored in second language (L2) speakers who may rely on more “shallow” representations. Using a megastudy dataset, we investigate how sensorimotor strength affects L1 and L2 word recognition performance. Bayesian hierarchical regressions revealed that variables associated with physical sensations (interoceptive strength, motor action) and communication experience (head or mouth movement, auditory strength) produced strong effects in both groups. On the other hand, variables associated with concrete objects (visual, haptic experience) and with taste/smell (olfactory, gustatory experience) influenced L1 word recognition performance to a larger extent than in L2. In L2, reliance on semantic information during word recognition is reduced, with stronger effects of lexical variables compared to L1. The findings provide implications for understanding second language processing mechanisms and demonstrate the usefulness of megastudy datasets in investigating L2 conceptual representations.",

          "authors": "Eran Eldar; danielle babitz",
          "abstract": "Social norms shape a vast range of human behaviors, from everyday interactions to major life choices. Yet, existing theories of norm emergence typically focus either on why certain norms arise (substantive properties) or on how they spread and persist (dynamical properties), often making conflicting assumptions. Here, we propose a unified account in which norms prescribing how one ought to act emerge naturally from the fundamental algorithms that guide individual learning—whether in social or non-social settings. Our account builds on recent advances in decision-making and emotion research that have highlighted ‘actor-critic’ models as a core mechanism of learning from feedback. We extend this mechanism to social settings by assuming that it is not only we who critique our actions, others critique our actions as well. By simulating this interindividual form of learning, we show that it uniquely produces group behavior that exhibits both substantive and dynamical properties of real-world social norms, including prosociality, ingroup bias, stickiness, self-reinforcement, and local conformity / global diversity. Our framework thus offers a uniquely parsimonious way to bridge the gap between individual learning and group behavior.",

          "abstract": "The dynamics of the stream of spontaneous thoughts has been the object of increasing research in recent years. Here, we study the timing of transitions from one coherent thought episode to the next as one aspect of such dynamics. Participants either vocalized spontaneously generated words or let their mind wander during 2 to 3-minute runs, and were instructed to report thought transitions with a key press. We first validate this subjective mental event segmentation, which enables us to measure the duration of coherent thought episodes. We then turn to model comparison to show that the timing of thought transitions is best explained by an accumulation-to-threshold mechanism. We further find that the threshold of this accumulation – but not the accumulation rate – negatively correlates with participants’ trait tendency for mind-wandering, highlighting the role of mental impulsivity in thought transitions.",

          "abstract": "Some spoken phrases, when heard repeatedly, seem to transform into music, in a classic finding known as the speech-to-song illusion. Repeated listening to musical phrases can also lead to changes in liking, attributed to learning-related reduction of prediction errors generated by the dopaminergic reward system. Does repeating spoken phrases also result in changes in liking? Here we tested whether repeated presentation of spoken phrases can lead to changes in liking as well as in musicality, and whether these changes might vary with reward sensitivity. We also asked whether perceptual biases towards low versus high frequencies, as assessed using the Laurel/Yanny illusion, are linked to changes in musicality and liking with repetition. Results show a general reduction in liking for spoken phrases with repetition, but less so for phrases that transition more readily into song. People who upweight low frequencies in speech perception (and so perceive Laurel rather than Yanny) are more susceptible to changes in musicality with phrase repetition and marginally less susceptible to changes in liking. Individuals with musical anhedonia still perceived the speech-to-song illusion, but liked all spoken phrases less; this did not interact with repetition. Results show a dissociation between perception and emotional sensitivity to music, and support a model of frequency-weighted internal predictions for acoustic signals that might drive the speech-to-song illusion. Rather than treating illusions as isolated curiosities, we can use them as a window into theoretical debates surrounding models of perception and emotion.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence, especially large language models (LLMs), has been widely used for scientific research. Yet, few studies have explored their potential to advance social science research. This research evaluates how effectively ChatGPT can mimic responses from real human participants on online crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), Prolific, and CloudResearch. We replicated 22 studies published in top psychology journals between January 2023 and June 2023. Since ChatGPT 4.0’s cutoff date is September 2021, its training database does not include articles published after that time. The current research is among the first to use ChatGPT to replicate social science studies whose conclusions have not been included in the training database of ChatGPT. This unique methodology strengthens the credibility of our findings and establishes a more robust foundation for applying AI in simulating human behavior. The results show that ChatGPT successfully replicates about 93.2% (20.5/22) of the findings from these studies. While conducting these studies (assuming each study is a typical 5-minute online experiment with 300 participants) on online crowdsourcing platforms could take approximately 11 days and cost around $3,960, using AI through a platform we term “AITurk” could reduce the time to about 11 minutes and the cost to $132. That is, AITurk achieves about 93.2% accuracy of real human participants’ responses on online crowdsourcing platforms, with about 1/1440 time and 1/30 cost. Based on these findings, we suggest that ChatGPT can be an effective tool for social science research, especially for conducting preliminary research and evaluating the replicability of existing studies.",

AB refers to the failure to detect the second of two temporally proximate targets. The experimental results demonstrated that participants who had encoded crime-relevant items were more likely to miss the second target when the first target was crime-relevant than when it was irrelevant. The result of the ROC analysis showed that the accuracy of discrimination based on AB magnitude was comparable to some of the autonomic indicators used in the current polygraph CIT.

This study investigates the multilevel factor structure of the 10-item PANAS-SF in a sample of young adults (n = 272) measured daily consecutively over one month. Additionally, dynamic relations between positive and negative affect, depressive symptoms, stress, and physical symptoms were examined. Results support a 3-factors within and 2-factors between multilevel structural model. Distinct dynamic relations were observed among positive, negative affect, stress, and physical symptoms at the within-level. Positive and negative affect were correlated with depressive symptoms, stress, and physical symptoms at the between-level.

          "abstract": "In this research study, we share original empirical research with 3000+ software engineers and developers across 12+ industries engaged in the transition to Generative AI-assisted software work. We bring a human-centered approach to pressing questions that engineering organizations are facing on the rapidly-changing possibilities of AI-assisted coding. How are developers impacted by changing demands on their roles? Where might there be emerging equity &amp; opportunity gaps in who has access to these new development capabilities? What are the risks to the quality of technical work, and the developer productivity, thriving, and motivation which drive that technical work? From this work we present a new evidence-based framework to help developers, engineering managers, and leaders as they grapple with failure to thrive in the transition to AI-assisted work: AI Skill Threat. AI Skill Threat describes developers’  fear, anxiety, and worry that their current skills will quickly become obsolete as they adapt to AI-assisted coding. Our framework also predicts when and why AI Skill Threat emerges: engineers who maintain a strong belief in competition and the demonstration of “innate brilliance” are more likely to report AI Skill Threat. However, engineers who report the presence of learning cultures and belonging are less likely to report AI Skill Threat. Finally, we document new and emerging equity and opportunity gaps for software teams adopting new tooling practices. AI Skill Threat is higher for Racially Minoritized developers, who also rate the overall quality of AI-assisted coding outputs significantly lower. Both female developers and LGBTQ+ developers were significantly less likely to report plans to upskilling for new AI-assisted workflows. These and other emerging differences point toward a critical need to understand how organizations ensure that AI-assisted coding adoption is equitable and accessible, and that key insights from developers with important perspectives on the risks of AI-assisted coding are heard.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Research on alcohol use disorder has exclusively focused on either its symptom-level mechanisms--the network perspective-- or sociodemographic determinants--epidemiological research. Moreover, such research failed to stratify analyses for important person-level factors (e.g., sex or ethnicity). Here, we combine network and epidemiological research and stratify analyses by person-level factors. \n\n\nMethod: Using Bayesian inference, we estimated (1) a logistic regression model predicting past-year alcohol consumption from various sociodemographic factors within a large, multiethnic, urban sample in the Netherlands (complete sample: N = 22,164), (2) a cross-sectional network model of alcohol use symptoms and sociodemographic factors among alcohol drinkers of the same sample (drinkers: N = 10,877), and (3) stratified networks at the sex- and ethnic- levels in the same drinkers subsample. \n\nResults: All of our examined sociodemographic factors predicted past-year alcohol consumption (in order of magnitude: religion, sex, education, employment, perceived ethnic discrimination, and age). Our Bayesian analysis of networks revealed three notable patterns. First, religion was uniquely and negatively related to adverse alcohol use problems (such as having an injury due to drinking). Second, socioeconomic proxies (education and employment) were positively related to binge drinking, but negatively related to its adverse effects (such as 'needing a drink in the morning'). Finally, employment and education were particularly negatively related to alcohol use symptoms within male and female networks, respectively. \n\nConclusion: \nOur results suggest that alcohol use symptoms are differentially related to sociodemographic factors and that these effects are moderated by sex and ethnicity. Our highlighted network links and Bayesian methodologies could prove useful for future research and prevention and intervention efforts on alcohol use disorders.",

          "authors": "Sabrina Gado; Matthias Gamer",
          "abstract": "When studying spontaneous or learned emotional responses to social stimuli, research has traditionally relied on simplified stimuli repeatedly presented on a computer screen in standardized laboratory environments. While these studies provided important insights into social perception and cognition, their restricted ecological validity may impede the extrapolation of findings to everyday social contexts. Here we developed a novel immersive virtual reality scenario that permits the examination of social approach- and avoidance behavior under naturalistic circumstances while at the same time maintaining full experimental control. Using a combination of a social conditioning procedure with a social approach-avoidance test, we conducted two experiments (both with N = 48 female participants) to investigate how individuals differing in trait social anxiety adapt their behavior after a single encounter with an either friendly or unfriendly virtual agent. In addition to overt approach and avoidance behavior, we acquired subjective ratings, eye-tracking data and autonomic responses. Overall, we observed significant effects of the social conditioning procedure on autonomic responses and participants’ exploration behavior. After initially increased attention, participants exhibited avoidance of social threats as indicated by a higher interpersonal distance and decreased visual attention towards the negatively conditioned virtual agent in the test phase. We found no association between hypervigilance and trait social anxiety but observed higher fear ratings and enhanced avoidance of social threats in participants with elevated anxiety levels. Altogether, this study demonstrates the potential of immersive virtual environments for examining social learning processes under conditions resembling real-life social encounters.",

          "abstract": "Human infants are limited in their self-guided navigation. Can they nevertheless learn about the places they’ll go? Across three experiments, we tested the role of spatial layout and language on pre-crawling 6-month-old infants’ (N = 96) ability to categorize places in a novelty-preference looking-time paradigm. We found that, when places are labeled, young infants are sensitive to their distinct spatial layouts and can learn place categories. When places’ spatial layouts are disrupted or when places are not labeled, by contrast, young infants cannot learn such place categories. Our results shed new light on young infants’ sensitivities to foundational domains of everyday life prior to their capacity for self-guided exploration.",

          "abstract": "Humans are inherently social creatures, yet considerable variability exists in our social behaviours. It is unclear what factors contribute to this variability. Given the complex and abundant sensory stimuli present in our daily environments, differences in sensory processing abilities may contribute to the variation observed in social behaviours. Individual differences in sensory processing may have significant effects on an individual's capacity to navigate social settings and may influence the development and expression of social competence. In this study, we investigated the relationship between one form of sensory processing difference, Decreased Sound Tolerance (DST), and social competence. Existing literature suggests that it is common for individuals with DST to engage in social avoidance behaviours to mitigate exposure to distressing sounds. However, limited research explores the potential relationship between DST severity and social competence. As such, a sample of 2095 undergraduate students completed an online survey designed to assess their DST severity and social competence. Initially, to parse the variability in social competence, scores on the multidimensional social competence scale (MSCS), underwent a k-means cluster analysis. This analysis yielded four unique social profiles based on seven social competence domains (e.g., social motivation, emotion regulation etc.). Misophonia and hyperacusis questionnaires were then used to evaluate differences in DST across the social profiles. The results indicated varying severity levels of both misophonia and hyperacusis across the four social profiles, with the individuals who reported the highest social competence exhibiting the lowest levels of DST. These findings highlight the potential relationship between sensory processing differences, such as DST, and social functioning.",

So far, little is known about the link between conspiracy beliefs and state resilience, despite a growing body of evidence on other macro-level predictors of conspiracy beliefs. State resilience has been shown to be critical for effective crisis management. However, this macro-level factor has been understudied in the context of belief in conspiracy theories. Bringing the concept of state resilience from fields such as security studies or economics to the social psychological literature on conspiracy beliefs, we conducted three studies (N = 42,643 participants nested in 51 countries, N = 297 UK participants, and N = 268 UK participants). Results showed that higher scores on the State Resilience Index (Study 1) and higher perceived state resilience (Studies 2 and 3) predicted lower COVID-19 (Study 1), climate change-related and generic conspiracy beliefs (Studies 2 and 3). The importance of state resilience as a macro-level predictor of conspiracy beliefs in the social psychological and policy-making domains is discussed.",

          "abstract": "In the Group Interaction and Perception of Others (GIPO) project, we collected data (N = 1,460) containing a large number of self- and informant-reported personality items and incentivized measures of prosocial and cheating behavior. Many participants (N = 699) also attended a laboratory session in which they interacted in groups of 7-9 individuals in two modified versions of the public goods game with punishment. During and after the public goods games, participants reported their perceptions, expectations, and evaluations of each other through round-robin ratings. Due to the extensive assessments of personality and incentivized social behavior included in the GIPO data, these data are suitable for investigating the links between personality traits and prosocial and cheating behavior. Furthermore, they can be analyzed to gain a fine-grained picture of the perceptions, expectations, and evaluations that precede or follow behavior in economic games. Finally, researchers might want to use the GIPO data to investigate the psychometric properties and in particular the validity of the personality measures we used. To facilitate use of the data, we made the anonymized GIPO data publicly available. Taken together, the GIPO data are a publicly available rich resource for investigating the links between personality and incentivized social behavior.",

          "abstract": "Big data and computational methods are transforming the landscape of social science research, enabling the analysis of increasingly complex phenomena. However, the ability of human researchers to synthesize vast datasets and model intricate relationships is limited. Thus, this study evaluates the capacity of large language models (LLMs; Qwen 2.5, Llama 3.1, and GPT-4) to identify variable relationships in social psychology, assessing their reasoning capabilities relative to both domain experts and non-domain experts. Therefore, we collected 56 meta-analyses of social psychology published in 2024, from which we extracted 247 variable relationships. We tasked LLMs and human experts to infer variable relationships based on variable definitions and compared their inferences with relationships reported in the meta-analyses, while also examining the impact of task difficulty, self-reported confidence levels, and relationship type on model performance. Our findings indicated that LLMs and domain experts performed similarly in identifying simple variable relationships (e.g., linear relationships and difference tests). However, the identification of more complex relationships, particularly moderating effects, presented a challenge for both. Furthermore, domain expertise significantly enhanced identification accuracy. Although a correlation was observed between model confidence and accuracy, it was not a strong predictor. Increased task complexity consistently reduced the performance of all LLMs. This study empirically examines the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, suggesting potential roles and limitations of algorithmic tools in social science, providing new evidence for data-driven academic practices.",

          "abstract": "Pedagogy is a powerful way to learn about the world, and young children are adept at both learning from teaching and teaching others themselves. Theoretical accounts of pedagogical reasoning suggest that an important aspect of being an effective teacher is considering what learners need to know, as misconceptions about learners’ beliefs, needs, or goals can result in less helpful teaching. One underexplored way in which teachers may fail to represent what learners know is by simply “going through the motions” of teaching, without actively engaging with the learner’s beliefs, needs, and goals at all. In the current paper, we replicate ongoing work that suggests children are sensitive to when others are relying on automatic scripts in the context of teaching. We then look at the potential link to two related measures. First, we hypothesize that sensitivity to a teacher’s perceived automaticity will be linked to classic measures of pedagogical sensitivity and learning – specifically, how children explore and learn about novel toys following pedagogical versus non-pedagogical demonstrations. Second, we hypothesize that the development of Theory of Mind (and age differences more broadly) relate to these pedagogical sensitivities. Our online adaptation of the novel toy exploration task did not invoke pedagogical reasoning as expected, and so we do not find robust links between these tasks. We do find that Theory of Mind predicts children’s ability to detect automaticity in teaching when controlling for age. This work thus highlights the connections between sensitivity to teaching and reasoning about others’ knowledge, with implications for the factors that support children’s ability to teach others.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Speech discrimination outcomes vary widely in cochlear implant recipients, but reasons for this variability are not well explained by patient history factors alone. Neuroplastic reorganisation after both deafness and cochlear implant switch-on can affect how new recipients adapt to electrical hearing. In this study, we evaluate the associations between speech understanding outcomes and stimulus evoked activation of cortical language processing areas. Design: 43 newly implanted post-lingually deaf adult cochlear implant recipients were recruited to the longitudinal study. Participants attended two research visits: the first conducted within one-month of device switch-on, and the second conducted one-year after device switch-on. At each visit, we evaluated speech understanding outcomes in noise and cortical activation using functional near infrared spectroscopy during a passive listening task, during which a story was told in either an auditory or visual-speech (lip-reading) condition. Results: We found statistically significant correlations between poorer speech understanding outcomes  one year post device switch-on and large activations in the superior temporal gyrus contralateral to the device in response to both auditory- (F(1, 30) = 11.297, R2 = 0.274, p = 0.002) and visual-speech (F(1, 30) = 18.216, R2 = 0.38, p &lt; 0.001) stimuli tested within one-month of switch-on. However, these significant associations were not observed using activation data from the one-year mark. Furthermore, we found no association between changes in activation of the superior temporal gyrus contralateral to the device and changes in speech understanding outcomes over the first year of implant use. Conclusions: Our evidence highlights that neuroplastic changes which occur following adult-onset deafness play an important role in how cochlear implant recipients adapt to their devices after switch-on. The relationship between neuroimaging measures made within one-month after device switch-on and speech understanding outcomes at one-year can potentially enable triaging of recipients to improve clinical management of implant recipients.",

This study aims to better understand how different neural limitations along the auditory processing pathway are associated with speech understanding outcomes.\nDesign: 43 cochlear implant recipients (44 ears) were recruited to participate in a longitudinal study to evaluate limitations at various locations along the auditory processing pathway. At the periphery, intra-cochlear neural health was estimated using focused psychophysical thresholds. Higher-order across-electrode intensity discrimination ability was assessed using psychophysical “spectral tilt”. At the cortical level, cross-modal activation of the auditory cortex was assessed using functional near infra-red spectroscopy. Speech understanding outcomes were evaluated in competing multi-talker babble noise at one-year post device switch-on.\nResults: We found that greater abilities to discriminate smaller across-electrode stimulation intensities (R2 = 0.138, p = 0.047) and smaller cross-modal activations of the auditory cortex (R2 = 0.216, p = 0.01) were significantly associated with better speech understanding outcomes in cochlear implant recipients. Furthermore, both measures contributed significantly to better predict speech understanding outcomes in a multiple regression model (Adj R2 = 0.312, p = 0.009).\nConclusion: The results suggest that recipient-specific neural factors contribute significantly towards individual differences in speech understanding outcomes. Different recipients can be affected by different limitations, which can be identified using these tests, and therefore lead to potential patient-specific methods to improve their speech understanding.",

          "abstract": "People robustly and rapidly infer traits from the social behavior of others. These \ntrait impressions support predictions about future behavior. How do people use this \nlearning flexibly in novel social situations? We propose people use maps of social \nknowledge (representing similarity between traits) to generalize trait impressions and \npredict behavior in new domains and contexts, a prediction we test across three \nexperiments. First, in a pilot study, we demonstrate that conceptual similarity between traits \npredicts situation-specific inferences of trait relevance. In Experiment 1, participants \nlearned about targets (described either as humans or non-human slot machines) whose \nbehavior in a task revealed sociability, and later, made choices about which partners to \nchoose in decision making tasks relevant to other traits. Trait similarity (i.e., between the \noriginal context and novel contexts) shaped partner choice, but critically, this relationship \nwas socially specific: participants generalized social learning based on trait similarity when \ninteracting with other humans but not with slot machines. In Experiment 2, participants \nwere given explicit trait labels describing potential partners. Here, we observed that trait \nsimilarity continued to influence generalization across an expanded set of traits and task \ncontexts, above and beyond the mere valence similarity of traits. While Exps. 1-2 \ndemonstrate trait-based generalization in decision-making, Experiment 3 demonstrated \nthat trait-based generalization occurs with relative spontaneity.

The primary task involved monitoring a 30-minute underwater REA, fixing drone navigational (“drift”) errors to induce attention, and the secondary task involved anomaly detection (image classification) of underwater images to simulate post-mission analysis.

One promising approach is enhancing workers’ emotion regulation skills. Although previous literature suggests promise, the long-term effectiveness of this approach is unknown. The present study evaluated a scalable intervention that taught reappraisal—an emotion regulation strategy that alters how individuals interpret challenging situations. We tested this intervention nationwide among low- and middle-income workers (e.g., drivers, teachers, food service workers) in early education, one of the most stressful and under-resourced sectors in the United States. Study 1 (n = 1,967), a pre-registered field survey, found positive correlations among reappraisal use, emotional well-being, and job performance. Study 2, a pre-registered longitudinal field experiment (n = 4,054), found lasting improvements in some emotional well-being and workplace outcomes (e.g., job performance, quit intentions, and impatient decision-making) from the reappraisal intervention (vs. active control) six months later.

          "abstract": "Relative to fractions, decimal numbers are thought to be easier for students to learn as they use the same base-10 place value system of whole numbers. However, unlike whole numbers, larger decimals can have fewer digits, e.g., 0.8 &gt; 0.26.  Accordingly, children and adults perform worse when comparing Inconsistent decimal pairs like 0.8 vs. 0.26 than Consistent ones like 0.86 vs. 0.2. This effect is typically attributed to the conflict between the number of digits and the magnitude of the decimal. But it could also result from students activating the whole number referents, i.e., the corresponding whole numbers without the decimals points (e.g., 8 vs. 26). We recently developed a stimulus set that can distinguish between these explanations by leveraging numerical distance effects. As in previous studies, our stimuli vary on the rational distance between pairs of numbers, and in our prior studies (Rosenberg-Lee, et al. 2023), we found that performance is lower for close comparisons (0.3 vs. 0.21, distance = 0.09) than far (0.8 vs. 0.26, distance = 0.54). However, we also varied the whole distance between the pairs, that is, the distance between the whole referents. Holding rational distance constant, participants were worse on problems where the whole distance was larger (0.9 vs. 0.81 =&gt; 9 vs. 81, whole distance 72) than smaller (0.3 vs. 0.21 =&gt; 3 vs 21, whole distance = 18), suggesting they were activating the whole referents. In this study, we use functional MRI during decimal comparison to identify brain systems related to rational distance and whole distance processing in university students (n=21). We anticipated that rational distance would modulate the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), which is implicated in numerical magnitude processing for whole and rational numbers, while frontal regions involved in working memory (middle frontal gyrus) and cognitive control (anterior cingulate cortex and insula) would process interference from whole distance. Interestingly, we did find rational magnitude sensitivity in the IPS, but only for Consistent comparisons, while the ACC was sensitive for rational distance only for Inconsistent comparisons. We found sensitivity to whole distance in the IPS and insula. These results contribute to growing evidence that whole number referents are automatically activated during decimal processing and require engagement of cognitive control regions to counteract. Further, these results highlight the unique challenges that decimals present for learners and point to the need for educators to emphasize differences to whole numbers rather than current practices which highlight similarities.",

          "abstract": "The “truth sandwich” correction format, in which false information is bookended by factual information, has frequently been presented as an optimal method for correcting misinformation. Despite recurring recommendations, there is little empirical evidence for enhanced benefits. In two pre-registered experiments (total N = 1046), we evaluated the effectiveness of the truth sandwich correction format against a “bottom-loaded” refutation format, in which the misinformation is first presented prior to factual statements. In Experiment 1, participants first rated belief in cancer misinformation. The misinformation was then corrected using the truth sandwich, corrected using a bottom-loaded refutation, or left uncorrected (control).

          "abstract": "Relative to fractions, decimal numbers are thought to be easier for students to learn as they use the same base-10 place value system of whole numbers. However, unlike whole numbers, larger decimals can have fewer digits, e.g., 0.8 &gt; 0.26.  Accordingly, children and adults perform worse when comparing Inconsistent decimal pairs like 0.8 vs. 0.26 than Consistent ones like 0.86 vs. 0.2. This effect is typically attributed to the conflict between the number of digits and the magnitude of the decimal. But it could also result from students activating the whole number referents, i.e., the corresponding whole numbers without the decimals points (e.g., 8 vs. 26). We recently developed a stimulus set that can distinguish between these explanations by leveraging numerical distance effects. As in previous studies, our stimuli vary on the rational distance between pairs of numbers, and in our prior studies (Rosenberg-Lee, et al. 2023), we found that performance is lower for close comparisons (0.3 vs. 0.21, distance = 0.09) than far (0.8 vs. 0.26, distance = 0.54). However, we also varied the whole distance between the pairs, that is, the distance between the whole referents. Holding rational distance constant, participants were worse on problems where the whole distance was larger (0.9 vs. 0.81 =&gt; 9 vs. 81, whole distance 72) than smaller (0.3 vs. 0.21 =&gt; 3 vs 21, whole distance = 18), suggesting they were activating the whole referents. In this study, we use functional MRI during decimal comparison to identify brain systems related to rational distance and whole distance processing in university students (n=21). We anticipated that rational distance would modulate the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), which is implicated in numerical magnitude processing for whole and rational numbers, while frontal regions involved in working memory (middle frontal gyrus) and cognitive control (anterior cingulate cortex and insula) would process interference from whole distance. Interestingly, we did find rational magnitude sensitivity in the IPS, but only for Consistent comparisons, while the ACC was sensitive for rational distance only for Inconsistent comparisons. We found sensitivity to whole distance in the IPS and insula. These results contribute to growing evidence that whole number referents are automatically activated during decimal processing and require engagement of cognitive control regions to counteract. Further, these results highlight the unique challenges that decimals present for learners and point to the need for educators to emphasize differences to whole numbers rather than current practices which highlight similarities.",

Increasing studies examined the dynamic associations between momentary fluctuations of anxiety and well-being, primarily focusing on the severity of general anxiety. Scant research has explored the co-fluctuations between different anxiety symptoms and mental health outcomes. \nMethod: Using eight items selected from the Screen for Adult Anxiety Related Disorders (SCAARED) scale, the current study evaluated the multi-level factor structure and assessed the subclinical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia (SP), and panic disorder (PD) in a sample of non-clinical young adults (N = 271, Mage = 18 years, 72% female, 68% non-White) who participated in a 30-day daily diary study. This study also measured participants’ emotional and peer problems using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, depressive symptoms with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale, and stress by the College Chronic Life Stress Survey.\nResults: Between persons, GAD, SP, and PD were positively correlated with depressive symptoms, stress, as well as emotional and peer problems. Within persons, both SP and PD were positively associated with stress, peer and emotional problems on the same day. Across days, there was positive reciprocal relation between PD and stress, whereas negative reciprocal link was observed between SP and emotional problems. \nConclusion: Current findings showed dynamic and distinct patterns in the associations between different anxiety symptoms and several mental health outcomes, which emphasizes the need to disentangle between- and within-person variation of anxiety symptoms with intensive longitudinal designs.",

Constructions are typically considered non-compositional units that have arisen from compositional ones. The process of a unit gradually becoming a construction is called constructionalisation. Once constructionalised, a form-meaning pair can undergo various changes both on the form and on the meaning side, ranging from changes in frequency and combinatorial preferences to significant changes in meaning. This process is referred to as constructional change. Constructionalisation and constructional change go hand in hand: Constructionalisation is the result of constructional changes, and changes in already constructionalised units can give rise to new constructions. A recurrent question that is frequently discussed in the literature, however, is when exactly we can speak of a ‘constructionalised’ unit, i.e. a new construction.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: The poor mental health of Australian adolescents is considered a public health\ncrisis. Development of brief screening tools to identify adolescents at high risk of Major Depressive\nDisorder (MDD) is consequently a high research and clinical priority. To address\nthis gap, the current study aims to investigate the extent to which the self-report Strengths\nand Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) accurately identifies 11-17-year-olds in the community\nwho meet diagnostic criteria for MDD. Methods: Data was from the Second Australian\nChild and Adolescent Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing. The sample included 2,967\nadolescents aged 11 to 17 years who answered the SDQ and for whom MDD was evaluated\nwith the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV (DISC-IV). To develop the\nscreening tool, seven prediction models were examined: (1) logistic regression (total score);\n(2) logistic regression (total score including prosocial behaviours); (3) logistic regression\n(subscale scores); (4) logistic regression (item scores); (5) logistic LASSO regression (item\nscores); (6) Markov Blanket-based logistic regression (item scores); and (7) XGBoost (item\nscores). Predictive performance was evaluated with the Area Under the Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic Curve (AUROC), Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC),\ncalibration, sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV). Results: A 3-item\nscreening tool (identified by the Markov Blanket-based logistic regression) performed the\nbest and achieved appropriate predictive performance (AUROC=0.73; AUPRC=0.16; sensitivity=\n67.5%; specificity=70.9%; and PPV=10.8%). Conclusion: A 3-item screening tool\ndisplayed appropriate predictive performance to identify MDD among Australian adolescents\naged 11 to 17 years in the community. Future studies should externally validate the\nproposed tool so it can be implemented in clinical practice.",

In nine pre-registered experiments (N=313 total), we examined the capacity limits of mentally simulating the movement of objects in the mind's eye. In a novel Imagined Objects Tracking task, participants continued the motion of animated objects in their mind up to a pre-defined point. When tracking one object in the imagination (Experiment 1a), participants gave estimations in line with ground truth. But, when imagining two objects (Experiment 1b), behavior altered substantially: responses were fit best by the predictions of a Serial Model that simulates only one object at a time, as opposed to a Parallel Model that simulates objects in tandem. The serial bottleneck is not due to response/motor limitations (Experiment 2), and is reduced - but not eliminated - by adding extremely strong grouping cues (Experiment 3). Additional studies and analyses validated that seriality is not due to factors like noise or lack of motivation, and is found also for hyper-simplified physics and naturalistic occlusion (Experiments S1-S5). Altogether, we find that the capacity of moving imagined entities is likely restricted to a single object at a time.",

Shorter rhythmic cycles were learned and recalled by Culturally Familiar Non-Musicians and Culturally Unfamiliar Musicians, while longer ones posed challenges.

          "abstract": "Personality pathology presents unique challenges in adolescence, a critical period for developing social autonomy and complex peer relationships. Yet, little research examines how these vulnerabilities unfold in daily life. This preregistered, multi-informant ambulatory assessment (AA) study tracked 294 adolescents (58.5% female) aged 12–21, capturing 13,190 interactions over 14 days. Using Contemporary Interpersonal Theory and the DSM-5 Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), we modeled links between personality pathology, perceptions of others’ and participants’ interpersonal behavior, and mentalizing. Multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) revealed that personality pathology was associated with lower daily social satisfaction in youth. Self-reports linked pathology to reduced perceived and enacted warmth, higher perceived and enacted dominance, and greater variability in all these processes, with informant reports showing similar but weaker patterns. Contrary to expectations, personality pathology was not associated with lower average mentalization but predicted greater fluctuations in mentalizing across interactions. Higher pathology strengthened the link between mentalizing and enacted dominance, driven by Antagonism, while Psychoticism showed the reverse pattern, weakening this association. Detachment reduced the association of mentalizing and perceived warmth, and negative affectivity weakened the link between mentalizing and enacted dominance. Findings highlight the dynamic nature of interpersonal dysfunction in adolescent personality pathology. Recognizing maladaptive patterns early may guide interventions that stabilize social interactions and promote mentalizing in ways that foster connection rather than control, reducing long-term challenges.",

For transgender and/or nonbinary (TNB) young adults, cissexism—the system of power relations that marginalizes TNB people in favor of cisgender people—may contribute to controlling partner dynamics. However, mechanisms linking cissexism to controlling partner dynamics remain underexplored. Using data from a cross-sectional online survey of romantically partnered U.S. TNB young adults (N=393; 18-30 years old; 50% nonbinary; 56% people of color), we tested two mediation pathways from interpersonal cissexism to controlling partner dynamics: (1) a cissexism-related beliefs pathway, in which cissexist rejection contributes to beliefs that may cause young adults to feel socially and emotionally dependent on romantic partners, and (2) a material-need insecurity pathway, in which cissexist discrimination contributes to material-need insecurity, leaving young adults dependent on romantic partners for needs such as food and housing. We tested individual paths using generalized linear models, then tested mediation pathways using natural effects mediation analysis, adjusting for age, gender, race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, and partner gender. The cissexism-related beliefs pathway was not supported. However, results supported the material-need insecurity pathway—namely, cissexist discrimination was positively associated with controlling partner dynamics (b=0.15; P=.012), with a significant joint indirect effect via material-need insecurity (food insecurity and housing instability; b=0.05; P=.022). Reducing TNB young adults’ vulnerability to controlling partner dynamics may require structural changes (e.g., laws, policies, norms) to prevent cissexist discrimination and material-need insecurity.",

One of the most striking displays of change blindness is shown\nin the work of John Grimes (1996), which demonstrated that if items in an image are altered at\nthe exact moment a participant moves their eyes, changes often go unnoticed. However, little is\nknown about participants’ awareness of changes in this task, and surprisingly, the work itself has\nnever been replicated. Here, we replicate and extend the work of John Grimes. Using a new set\nof stimuli, we conducted two experiments in two separate laboratories (the University of Florida\nand Lingnan University in Hong Kong) to facilitate “simultaneous replication” of this\nphenomenon. In our first experiment, we replicated the work of John Grimes and showed that\nparticipants miss retroactively obvious changes to visual scenes on approximately half of the\ntrials. Additionally, on “miss” trials when an (unnoticed) change occurred, participants were\napproximately equally likely to select awareness of either the pre-change or post-change feature\nin the image. Fixation position played a critical role in modulating awareness in the task: failing\nto refixate changed items after the change occurred significantly increased the miss rate. Further,\non miss trials, not looking at the changed item made it more likely to report awareness of the prechange item, but fixating the item after the change increased the likelihood of selecting the postchange attribute. In our second experiment, we ran the same task using image pairs where the\nchanges were meaningful or incongruent. Images with either a meaning change or scene\ncongruence change were noticed at higher rates than neutral changes, and the higher the degree\nof meaning or congruence-related change, the more likely a change was detected. Together, these\nresults replicate the work of John Grimes, reveal gaze-contingent correlates of change detection\nin our tasks, and can inform current theories (e.g., Higher-Order Theory) of visual awareness.",

          "abstract": "Background. Enduring mental health conditions typically begin in adolescence. Social adversity (e.g., discrimination, bullying, trauma) may disrupt the development of healthy social learning processes and self and other beliefs. We tested the impact of prior social adversity and current social exclusion on paranoia, self and other beliefs and latent social learning processes in UK adolescents (15-17 years, n=502), using pre-registered hypotheses (AsPredicted #154322), causal Bayesian models, and exploratory analyses. Study Design. An experimental design tested (a) whether social exclusion interacted with prior social adversity to increase paranoia, (b) whether this occurred due to activating negative self and other beliefs, and (c) whether this was moderated by cognitive flexibility (i.e., moderated-mediation). Cognitive flexibility, alongside computational processes of social information generalisation, were assessed using The Intentions Game (Barnby et al., 2024). Study Results. Social exclusion triggered paranoia, which was intensified by prior social adversity, and substantially reduced latent belief flexibility about the self and others, inhibiting learning and subduing other-to-self generalisation (social contagion). Negative self and other beliefs were a mechanism through which social adversities lead to paranoia in the context of exclusion. Prior exposure to discrimination amplified state paranoia irrespective of inclusion/exclusion. Conclusion. Social adversity enhances susceptibility to paranoia following a social exclusion manipulation, in part due to activating negative self and other beliefs. Failure to detect pro-sociality in others, impacted by the rigidly with which negative self and other beliefs are held, as well as by discrimination in particular, likely exacerbates and maintains paranoia. Findings directly inform likely profitable intervention targets.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated the influence of contextual factors on mind wandering (MW) by leveraging an online platform for an established laboratory task. We investigated how direct performance feedback, information about task progression, and the feeling of being monitored influenced performance indices in a task used to investigate the effect of MW on executive control. Our results indicate that specific performance feedback, and not general positive feedback, consistently improved performance, while neither impacted self-reported MW. Conversely, feedback on task progression and the feeling of being monitored increased self-reported MW, possibly reflecting participant self-awareness due to contextual distractions. Intriguingly, information relaying task progression also substantially increased performance. These findings highlight the potential of performance feedback to reduce the negative effects of MW on task performance in an online setting. Additionally, the findings suggest that information about task progression, as well as the notion of being monitored during the experiment can influence task focus and should be taken into consideration when investigating fluctuations of attention during cognitive tasks.",

          "abstract": "Confidence leak (i.e., confidence serial dependence) is a phenomenon where confidence from a previous trial predicts confidence in a current trial independent of current choice or accuracy. Confidence leak has been shown to robustly occur across various cognitive domains and tasks. However, it remains unclear what factors, if any, modulate the strength of the confidence serial dependence. Here we investigate whether switching the motor response in a perceptual decision-making task influences the strength of the confidence leak effect. Subjects indicated the orientation of a Gabor patch using their left or right hand, with the response hand being randomly cued on each trial. We found that switching the response substantially weakened the confidence leak effect. We further replicated this finding in a second experiment in which left-hand responses were given using a keyboard and right-hand responses were given with a mouse. In both experiments, we also found that confidence leak was weaker whenever the left hand was used in the previous trial, suggesting that lack of motor fluency reduces the strength of confidence serial dependence. These results demonstrate that switching the motor response weakens serial dependencies and imply that the action required to make a choice can impact one’s metacognitive evaluations.",

          "abstract": "In an uncertain world, traditional decision-making models and wisdom cultivation methods fall short. Emulating exemplars or relying on mental shortcuts and habits may help in some situations but often fail with ill-defined problems and transformative decisions. We propose that cultivating metacognition—the ability to reflect on and regulate one's thoughts, goals, and emotions—is key to navigating these challenges. Metacognitive strategies like intellectual humility, perspective-taking, and open-mindedness help individuals discern complex situations, consider multiple viewpoints, and adapt their decision-making. Though not a cure-all, metacognition represents a promising frontier in cultivating wisdom. Insights from philosophy, psychology, and contemplative traditions suggest a range of interventions to foster metacognitive skills and enhance wise decision-making amid radical uncertainty. We call for a paradigm shift in how we approach judgment and decision-making, inviting researchers and practitioners to explore the untapped potential of metacognition in navigating life’s most complex challenges.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the neurocognitive basis of cognitive control and its relationship with general cognitive ability is a key challenge in individual differences research. This study investigates midfrontal theta connectivity as a neurocognitive marker for individual differences in cognitive control. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we examined midfrontal global theta connectivity across three distinct cognitive control tasks in 148 participants. Our findings reveal that midfrontal theta connectivity can be modeled as a trait-like latent variable, indicating its consistency across tasks and stability over time. However, the reliability of the observed measures was found to be low to moderate, suggesting substantial measurement error. We also replicated previous results, finding a strong correlation (r = 0.64) between midfrontal theta connectivity and cognitive abilities, especially during higher-order stages of information processing. We disentangled the specific cognitive processes contributing to this relationship by employing a task-cueing paradigm with distinct cue and target intervals. The results indicated that only theta connectivity during response-related processes, not during cue-evoked task-set reconfiguration, correlated with cognitive abilities. These insights significantly advance theoretical models of intelligence, highlighting the critical role of specific aspects of cognitive control in cognitive abilities.",

          "authors": "Ansgar D Endress; Maureen de Seyssel",
          "abstract": "Learning statistical regularities from the environment is ubiquitous across domains and species. It might support the earliest stages of language acquisition, especially identifying and learning words from fluent speech (i.e., word-segmentation). But how do the statistical learning mechanisms involved in word-segmentation interact with the memory mechanisms needed to remember words -- and with the learning situations where words need to be learned? Through computational modeling, we first show that earlier results purportedly supporting memory-based theories of statistical learning can be reproduced by memory-less Hebbian learning mechanisms. We then show that, in a memory recall task after exposure to continuous, statistically structured speech sequences, participants track the statistical structure of the speech sequences and are thus sensitive to probable syllable transitions. However, they hardly remember any items at all, with 82% producing no high-probability items. Among the 30% of participants producing (correct) high- or (incorrect) low-probability items, half produced high-probability items and half low-probability items~--- even while preferring high-probability items in a recognition test. Only discrete familiarization sequences with isolated words yield memories of actual items. Turning to how specific learning situations affect statistical learning, we show that it predominantly operates in continuous speech sequences like those used in earlier experiments, but not in discrete chunk sequences likely more characteristic of early language acquisition. Taken together, these results suggest that statistical learning might be specialized to accumulate distributional information, but that it is dissociable from the (declarative) memory mechanisms needed to acquire words and does not allow learners to identify probable word boundaries.",

Despite extensive research on the costs and benefits of these states, our understanding of the relationship between mind-wandering, boredom, attention, and memory remains limited. In the current study, we examined the impact that mind-wandering and boredom during encoding have on recognition. In particular, we investigated what impact mind-wandering and boredom have during the encoding of visual stimuli on the pupil old/new effect during recognition. We used an incidental memory task and measured mind-wandering and boredom with thought probes during encoding. Furthermore, we used the pupil old/new effect, assessed via eye-tracking, as a measure of recognition memory. We found a significant effect of boredom on recognition memory and observed the pupil old/new effect in participants regardless of instances of mind-wandering or boredom during encoding. Our findings point towards different mechanisms that underly mind-wandering and boredom’s obstruction of attention during stimuli encoding and their effects on stimuli processing. In addition, these findings reinforce the idea of the pupil old/new effect as a reliable measure of recognition memory as it remained consistent irrespective of attentional lapses due to mind-wandering and boredom.",

          "abstract": "We examine how first language (L1) Spanish listeners with varying levels of experience with English recalibrate their phonemic category boundaries following exposure to second language (L2), American English-accented Spanish. Specifically, we examine changes to voice onset time (VOT) boundaries, which are often positively-shifted when produced by American English-accented Spanish speakers (as compared to L1 Spanish speakers). Our results demonstrate that listeners make adjustments to their phonemic category boundaries following exposure to accented words with the critical sounds in onset position (e.g., “bailar” and “parir”, meaning “to dance” and “to give birth”, for the /b/ and /p/ phonemic categories). In many cases generalization of phonemic learning was also observed, such that boundaries for categories that were not presented in training were also adjusted. Surprisingly, however, there were cases in which boundaries for trained categories did not show adjustments; for example, listeners trained with items for all places of articulation (POAs) showed recalibration of their bilabial and alveolar boundaries but not their velar boundary. Also notable was the role of the Spanish listeners' experience with English: More experienced listeners showed more positively-shifted (English-like) boundaries in the pre-test session. This suggests that more experienced listeners may have rapidly identified the American English-accented Spanish and applied their English category boundaries accordingly. We conclude that listener accommodation of L2 accent is supported by a phonemic recalibration mechanism, and that experience with the L1 of an L2-accented speaker facilitates rapid recalibration of phonemic categories.",

Van Elk and Blanke (2014) demonstrated that vestibular stimulation modulates spatial perspective taking. This study aims to replicate and expand this finding. Therefore, twenty participants performed a mental body transformation task while seated on a chair that rotated alternately in a clockwise and counterclockwise direction. Each participant completed trials during both the acceleration and deceleration phases of the chair rotation. During the acceleration phase, an interaction was observed between chair rotation direction and implied mental body rotation direction, indicating a congruency effect: Reaction times were faster when the implied mental body rotation direction matched the chair rotation direction during the acceleration phase. This was not found in the deceleration phase. These findings are consistent with those of the original study. Furthermore, a three-way interaction between chair rotation direction, implied mental body rotation direction, and rotational phase was discovered, which was not examined in the original study. This suggests that the previously noted interaction varies between the acceleration and deceleration phases. These findings support that vestibular stimulation modulates spatial perspective taking but also highlight the impact of the rotational phase on this process.",

Contrary to a general account of cultural transmission, education did not predict cultural similarities to other large, culturally and politically influential countries, such as China, Russia, and India. Contrary to modernization theories, income and self-reported subjective status did not show the same pattern of WEIRD cultural similarity.

The model integrates interoceptive, proprioceptive, and exteroceptive predictive processing, which minimizes the variational free energy throughout the past and future contexts. Simulations of resting state showed that inferred (mentally simulated) homeostatic context modulated attentional shifts between a “being” mode (focused on present interoceptive perception) and a “doing” mode (involving proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensorimotor loops). Further, we identified a meta-attentional parameter that controls these shifts by influencing cognitive attitudes towards internally generated beliefs across network modules spanning the past to the future. By manipulating this parameter, we replicated mindfulness states (“deep-being” mode) in which attention remained focused on the present interoceptive state despite minimal sensory prediction errors. This study offers insights into the computational dynamics of mindfulness and mind-wandering, laying the groundwork for the future exploration of consciousness and pure awareness, which is a state of consciousness devoid of content.",

          "abstract": "Clinical differentiation between adolescent suicidal self-harm (SSH) and nonsuicidal self-harm (NSSH) is a sig- nificant challenge for mental health professionals, and its feasibility is controversial. The aim of the present study was to determine whether adolescent SSH can be differentiated from NSSH based on a holistic multimodel domain analysis (HMDA) of individual, psychological, sociodemographic, and environmental data without relying on intent and acquired capability for suicide. The study also sought to compare the compatibility of the HMDA result with four theories of suicide: the interpersonal theory of suicide, the three-steps theory, the inte- grated motivational-volitional model, and the theory of adolescent suicidality and self-destruction. This cross- sectional study analyzed data from a nationwide survey conducted from 2017 to 2019 in Norway. The sample included 26,904 adolescents (mean age=15.01; 29.9 % males), who self-reported suicidal and nonsuicidal self- harm. The meta-learner classification model reached an AUC of 77.0 % and a 70.0 % for both sensitivity and specificity in differentiating the two conditions. Exploratory factor analysis suggested eight factors for clustering the important risk and protective indicators: 1) disordered eating and future orientation, 2) sleep disturbance, 3) orientation toward affects and self, 4) risk-taking behavior, 5) peer relationships, 6) victimization, safety, and security, 7) family relationships, and 8) substance use. These factors emphasize that domains central to adolescent physical, personal, social, and expected future well-being provide invaluable information about risk of suicidal and self-destructive behavior. The results also indicated that despite their high comorbidity, adolescent SSH and NSSH are multifaceted and can be differentiated without relying on suicide-related information. These findings fully supported the theory of adolescent suicidality and self-destruction and partially supported the ideation-to-action theories.",

This study examined college students’ reading patterns across different mediums, purposes, and contexts. Data from 922 students of US universities revealed distinct patterns in reading habits and preferences. Students engaged in an average of 1.68 hours of pleasure reading and 4.16 hours of news consumption weekly. Graduate students reported more extensive reading habits (8.61 hours/week) compared to undergraduates (5.55 hours/week). Medium preferences varied significantly by purpose: students favored paper formats for leisure reading (53.79%) but showed a strong preference for screens in academic contexts (76.04%) and news consumption (80.03%). This digital dominance in academic reading persisted despite evidence suggesting better comprehension with paper materials, likely driven by the accessibility and cost advantages of digital texts. Analysis of COVID-19’s impact revealed that 37% of students increased their leisure reading during lockdown, primarily as a stress management strategy. The study also uncovered distinct multitasking patterns: while 36.9% reported reading for pleasure without other activities, only 23.5% maintained singular focus during academic reading. These findings suggest that supporting student success requires understanding and adapting to evolving patterns of textual engagement, particularly as institutions navigate the balance between digital accessibility and optimal learning conditions.\nKeywords.

          "abstract": "Previous research on emotion regulation abilities has primarily focused on individual strategies and their association with (a lack of) well-being and psychopathology. Recent frameworks add emphasis to the importance of a context-sensitive and goal-dependent approach to emotion regulation, defining emotion regulation flexibility as the ability to adaptively adjust emotion regulation strategies based on contextual demands and personal goals. Despite growing evidence for its relevance in psychological well-being and psychopathology, a concise self-report measure capturing trait-level, strategy-independent ER flexibility has been lacking. To address this gap, we developed the Flexible Emotion Regulation Scale (FlexER-Scale), designed to assess the context- and goal-dependent variability of emotion regulation strategies. The scale was derived from theoretical models of emotion regulation flexibility and validated using data from three independent samples (N = 857). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) examined the scale’s structure, and criterion validity was assessed via correlation with the WHO-5 Well-Being Index. The final 10-item FlexER-Scale demonstrated good psychometric properties, including satisfactory item discrimination and high internal consistency (α = .85). EFA suggested a two-factor structure, differentiating the ability to upregulate negative and downregulate positive emotions as a separate factor. The FlexER-Scale correlated significantly with psychological well-being (r = −.244, p &lt; .001), supporting criterion validity. The FlexER-Scale provides a novel, psychometrically sound tool for assessing trait-level emotion regulation flexibility. It offers a concise alternative to existing assessments by capturing adaptive regulatory variability without restricting specific strategies. Future research should further examine its construct validity, as well as its longitudinal stability, predictive and ecological validity to further elucidate its role in psychological well-being and resilience.",

However, to date, no validated measure has existed with which to quantify TNB identity support in romantic relationships. We used a four-stage process to develop and evaluate a multidimensional measure of TNB identity support from romantic partners. First, we generated items based on prior qualitative research, then used cognitive interviews with six TNB young adults (ages 18-30 years) to refine the items. Second, we piloted 59 items in a survey of 321 TNB people (16 years and older) reporting on current or recent romantic relationships. Using those data, we performed exploratory factor analysis to identify subscales, then selected 19 items based on factor loadings, item-subscale correlations, α-if-item-deleted, discrimination parameters, and item information curves. Third, we used weekly diary survey data from 299 romantically partnered TNB young adults (ages 18-30 years) to perform confirmatory factor analysis and assess reliability at the within- and between-relationship levels. Results indicate that the 19-item Transgender/Nonbinary Identity Support from Partners Scale (TISPS) assesses five forms of TNB identity support—Facilitation [of identity exploration], Identity Validation, Celebration, Allyship, and Understanding—with a consistent factor structure and good reliability at the between-relationship level. Psychometric results were poorer for weekly within-relationship variation, suggesting that TISPS subscales have suboptimal properties for assessing short-term change. The TISPS can be used in clinical and community settings and future research on the role of social support in TNB mental health.",

          "abstract": "What differentiates a happy day from a typical one? Answering this question can help to identify the building blocks of a happy life, but little is known about what makes some days better than others. To identify the ingredients of a good day, we used interpretable machine learning techniques to assess how time spent on over 100 activities predicted whether Americans rated their day as typical or “better than typical.” Using data from the 2013 (N = 9286) and 2021 (N = 6196) waves of the American Time Use Survey, we identified clear tipping points that distinguish better days from typical ones. Socializing was one of the most important activities for having a good day, but beyond 2 hours, additional socializing had little impact. Time spent with friends, in contrast, had an almost boundlessly positive effect. The impact of working was also highly time contingent. We found that working for up to six hours had no impact on whether people rated their day as better than usual. When individuals worked for more than six hours though, the effects rapidly turned negative. Taken together, our results suggest that good days emerge from the constantly shifting value of time; each minute in a day represents a choice between competing opportunities, with clear tipping points when benefits diminish and costs mount.",

This article proposes a transdisciplinary framework to overcome such challenges. This framework was informed via a cross-functional research synthesis, including 77 practice-partner identified texts representing international frameworks, indices, and organisational repositories associated with human need, manmade and natural systems, and humanitarian and peacebuilding tenets that inform global policy and intervention. The academic literature review identified current barriers that prevent effective conceptualisation, measurement, and analysis with wellbeing and peacebuilding, and was coded to develop a Universal Object Needs Framework (UONF).

          "abstract": "Cognitive conflict is a broad phenomenon ranging from classic stimulus-response incompatibility to moral dilemmas. Traditionally, cognitive control theories have focused on conflict detection and resolution as competition at the response level. Instead, the conflict between representations at the perceptual level has remained largely unexplored within this framework. Here, we call attention to the fact that perception itself necessarily involves conflict resolution. Is there a common ground to unify theories of cognitive conflict and control with the theories of perception? We propose that shifting the focus away from motor representations and considering conflict awareness could provide a new perspective for the integration of cognitive conflict across different levels of representation, including the case of perceptual conflict.",

          "abstract": "Learning about the social expectations tied to upcoming social roles can prompt a strong drive for personal change, yet effective adaptation requires balancing this external pressure with the preservation of stable self-views. Here, we use computational models to provide a mechanistic account of how individuals at the onset of significant life transitions utilize their self-concept to modulate self-role dissonances during social role learning. We conducted two studies with distinct populations at the onset of important life transitions: first-year university students and pregnant women. Participants engaged in a learning task where they first provided self-ratings for different traits and then estimated how these traits would apply to an individual well-adapted to their forthcoming social role and received trial-by-trial feedback about their estimations of role-specific traits from reference groups (i.e., senior university students and experienced mothers). We hypothesized that individuals would employ strategies to minimize dissonances between their current self-concept and role expectations during the learning process. We formalized a series of computational models including strategies that straightforwardly integrate social expectations about new roles to more complex strategies that involve leveraging the current self-concept against the pure incorporation of role-related information. The best-performing computational model indicated that the self-concept acts as a modulatory mechanism, guiding the integration of incoming role information to minimize conflicts between existing identities and role-related expectations. Critically, comparative analysis of computational parameters indicated that this strategy was strongly accentuated in individuals learning about forthcoming social contexts. Our work provides a mechanistic perspective on role learning that could inform interventions to support individuals facing important life transitions.",

However, to date, the vast majority of research into understanding and countering misinformation has taken place in the Global North, and the practical, methodological, and financial complications of doing research with underrepresented groups in Global South countries pose substantial limitations. For this study, we developed five humorous, live-action “prebunking” videos starring a well-known influencer from India, each tackling a different manipulation technique often used on Indian social media: spoofing, decontextualization, the perfect solution fallacy, emotional manipulation, and scapegoating. We hypothesized that the videos would significantly improve people’s ability to correctly identify these techniques in news and social media content in an online pilot study (N1 = 547), two field studies (N2 = 4,272, N3 = 1,676), and a large-scale study on YouTube (N4 = 129,710). We find limited support for our main hypotheses, observing some significant but no consistent improvement in technique discernment. In a series of focus group discussions (N5 = 33) and an additional randomized controlled trial (N6 = 827), we explore why this is the case. We find that, while the videos were considered highly entertaining and useful by the majority of viewers, the item rating tasks we administered (evaluating a series of social media posts) were an unfamiliar method of efficacy assessment for our participants. We discuss how interventions can be best designed and measured in contexts where assumptions from the Global North may not apply.",

As climate disinformation can undermine public support of climate policies and trust in climate science, it is crucial to understand what leads to exposure and acceptance of climate disinformation. Whereas previous research examined the effects of disinformation on climate beliefs, little is known about how people seek climate-related content (Pro- or Anti-climate) and how this varies between cross-cultural contexts. In a preregistered experiment, we studied how individuals sequentially sample and process climate-related information and disinformation. Participants from the U.S., China and Germany (Ntotal = 2226) freely sampled real-world climate related statements. Across 15 rounds, participants decided between two boxes containing Pro-climate or Anti-climate statements, respectively. Overall, reading a statement influenced climate concern in all countries. Participants preferred the box that was better aligned with their initial climate beliefs, and this confirmatory tendency intensified in later rounds. While climate concern was mostly stable, in the U.S., climate concern levels and box choices mutually reinforced each other, leading to greater polarization within the sample over time. The paradigm offers new perspectives on how people process and navigate conflicting narratives about climate change.",

Although recent research has supported personality’s malleability, it is unclear how lifespan changes in personality traits compare to changes in other individual differences and how the public perceives this relative stability. Here, we investigate these perspectives using a multimethod, comparative approach across personality and other individual differences. In an online survey with a US-representative sample (n = 887), we found that laypeople believe personality traits change significantly less across the lifespan than other variables from domains like health and well-being. In contrast, using data from eight longitudinal panel studies (n = 166,971), we found that changes in personality were similar to many other commonly studied aspects of life, even surpassing lifespan changes in life satisfaction, self-esteem, subjective health, and church attendance, among others. Together, our results highlight that the durable view that personality traits are among the most stable aspects of life is at odds with the empirical reality. Given the implications of personality change and beliefs about personality change for future outcomes and successful interventions, it is crucial to effectively disseminate evidence to foster accurate beliefs about personality change.",

The current study delves into this contrast, seeking to understand how art is perceived and appreciated in museums and on a digital medium (like a computer screen). Across two experiments at the Barnes Foundation and Penn Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, we explored how the aesthetic engagement of paintings and artifacts is influenced by the physical context in which an artwork is encountered and by the characteristics of the viewer. Our findings suggest that the cognitive and emotional impacts of artworks on viewers, as well as the viewers’ overall aesthetic experiences are comparable across physical museum spaces and digital platforms. However, participants reported gaining more understanding from art viewed in museums, compared to participants who viewed art in the lab. Art experience and openness to experience influenced aesthetic impacts and ratings differently in the museum and in the lab. Overall, routes to broader valuations of liking were more similar than different between the museum and lab contexts, whereas patterns of impacts that might lead to new knowledge or understanding gained differed between museum and lab contexts. As digital technologies are increasingly integrated into diverse processes in museums such as collections management, curation, exhibitions, and education and learning, our research highlights how museums can leverage digital expansion to achieve their missions as centers of learning and education.",

Whereas some people justify existing systems of power to maintain the status quo, others seek to challenge those systems, believing that existing systems distribute power inequitably across social groups. We aimed to establish a new psychological construct that reflects and accounts for how marginalized groups are not merely passive recipients of other people’s prejudice but form attitudes that resist and reconstrue status inequalities. In seven studies (N = 1,973), we developed and validated a measure to assess stigmatized groups’ attitudes toward dominant groups: the Upward Resistance Scale (URS). We examined LGBQ people’s attitudes toward heterosexual people, racial minorities’ attitudes toward white people, women’s attitudes toward men, poor people’s attitudes toward the wealthy, and fat people’s attitudes toward thin people. We found that the extent to which participants acknowledged status discrepancies between their ingroup and the dominant outgroup, they felt greater upward resistance toward the dominant outgroup. Our findings suggest that the 14-item URS is valid and reliable for detecting individual differences in beliefs about dominant groups and the status and privilege that they occupy.",

This manuscript explores one suggested TTE of intergroup contact affecting political attitudes and behaviours mediated via intergroup ideologies in a multi-verse approach combining several intergroup contact, intergroup ideologies and political attitudes and behaviours indicators. We used three waves of the Chilean Longitudinal Social Survey (ELSOC), a representative large-scale annual survey (N = 2,863), and random-intercept cross-lagged panel models as advanced analytical methods. We found numerous stable between-person associations between intergroup contact, intergroup ideologies and political attitudes and behaviours. We did not find consistent longitudinal evidence supporting a within-person process of intergroup contact affecting intergroup ideologies and in turn political attitudes and behaviours, as proposed by the cognitive liberalisation hypothesis. We contextualise our findings in the existing literature as well as the emerging TTE research and provide suggestions for future",

          "abstract": "Continuous flow and evidence accumulation models have recently been combined to provide an integrated account of decision and motor mechanisms engaged in choice reaction time tasks. According to this account, muscle activation is essentially determined by the evidence accumulation decision variable through a continuous decision-to-motor transmission of information. However, it remains unclear whether and how this framework can be extended to situations that impose a time lag between the commitment to a choice and the expression of that choice through actions. Such situations have been studied using response signal (RS) decision tasks featuring a short delay between the offset of the stimulus and a signal to respond. The present work integrates recent developments in decision-making, working memory, and motor control research to extend models of immediate decision reports to delayed decision reports. We assumed that the evidence accumulation decision variable transitions to sustained activity after hitting a threshold to achieve the short-term maintenance of the selected choice. The level of sustained activity then constitutes the starting point for a second phase of accumulation, in which subjects sample evidence from the RS to activate the muscles. We tested predictions from the theory at the behavioral and muscle activation levels in three RS decision tasks featuring manipulations of stimulus duration, delay duration, and foreknowledge of the stimulus-response mapping. Muscle activation was measured using electromyography. The theory provided a unified account of empirical effects.",

          "abstract": "Night gaps are inherent to data obtained with the experience sampling method (ESM). When such data are used to study lagged relations between variables--such as autoregression within the same variable, and cross-lagged regressions between different variables--the actual role of night gaps is typically not investigated. However, there are various methods to handle them in analyses. Common solutions involve: (1) ignoring the night gap by considering the night interval as a regular interval; (2) removing the night gap by not regressing the first measurement of the day on the last measurement of the previous day; or (3) treating the night gap as a missing data problem. The goal of this paper is to make explicit the theoretical implications of these three methods within the context of the first-order autoregressive (AR[1]) model. Additionally, we propose an alternative modeling approach that allows us to study the implications of the night gap in more detail. Moreover, given that the current methods are special cases of the proposed alternative, we can test which method best describes the process of interest. Through an empirical N=1 example with various ESM variables, we demonstrate that the best-fitting method differs per variable. This implies that some processes may exhibit different dynamics during the night than during the daytime, providing a stepping stone to understanding and modeling night gaps in ESM.",

Study 1 was a conceptual replication of previously observed relationships between insight puzzles, the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), and the Verbal Cognitive Reflection Test (VCRT). Study 2 examined differences between analytical and insightful tasks using self-report insight scales. Five dimensions of insight were measured: suddenness, confidence, pleasure, the aha! experience, and arousal. \nResults showed a clear and positive correlation between insight puzzles and reflective tests (CRT, VCRT) in both studies, these supporting results from previous studies. Additionally, no differences in feelings of insight were observed between insight puzzles and the Cognitive Reflection Test. However, feelings of insight were greater for the VCRT than for insight puzzles. This suggests that the experience of insight may not be exclusively tied to a specific type of problem; rather, it may reflect a style of problem solving that can emerge in various task contexts.",

          "abstract": "Research and practice aimed at enhancing state motivation through job assignments that align with workers' trait motivations have demonstrated significant benefits. \"Occupational personality traits\" refer to Openness to experience (O), Extraversion (E), and Agreeableness (A) factors, which are associated with personality traits and occupational preferences. These traits facilitate the assessment of motivation and enable comparative analyses of the effectiveness of personality versus preference, as they share core semantics (i.e., O, E, or A) but differ in situational characteristics (i.e., broad everyday personalities versus occupation-specific preferences). This study examines occupational personality traits as indicators of an individual's trait-like motivation. We asked workers to rate both the person (i.e., their trait motivation for various jobs) and the environment (i.e., their actual occupation) using occupational personality traits and their current work motivation state. Polynomial regression with response surface analysis revealed that the motivational state was highest when person and job ratings aligned across the O, E, and A factors. This alignment effect was independently significant for O personality, E preference, and A preference, suggesting that specific factors dominate depending on the situation's breadth or occupational specificity. Our findings lay the groundwork for developing job assignments that align with employees' inherent motivational orientations, utilizing factor-specific constructs to foster a more motivated workforce.",

Male adults scored higher on instrumental harm and showed lower diversity endorsement, with AI engagement linked to stronger utilitarianism but weaker diversity support. Given males greatly outnumber females in the AI workforce, our findings suggest that AI-builders are likely more utilitarian and less diversity-endorsing than -users. However, results from adolescents indicate that, particularly for utilitarianism, these differences may converge for future cohorts depending on the composition of the workforce. Our findings underscore that a more diverse AI workforce is crucial for aligning moral and diversity preferences with broader societal values.",

Previous research has shown that sending a facial emotional expression influences the evaluation of response expressions, but the mechanisms behind this effect remain unclear. In a preregistered experiment, 68 participants were asked to send an emoji (happy, neutral, angry) to a virtual agent in front of them, whereupon the agent reacted with either a smiling or frowning facial expression. Valence and arousal ratings were obtained and mimicry responses to the agent’s expression were measured via facial EMG of the Zygomaticus and Corrugator muscle. The results show that being smiled at is more pleasant and elicits greater Zygomaticus activation when the smile is received as a response to a happy emoji compared to an angry emoji. In contrast, being frowned at is less pleasant and increased Corrugator activity when the angry expression is received as a response to a happy compared to an angry emoji. Finally, we found that sending an emoji resulted in activation of facial muscles corresponding to the valence of the emoji. The results support the role of affiliative mechanisms in the exchange of facial expressions but also demonstrate that persons are sensitive to the congruency between emotional signals of sender and receiver. These effects might be driven by physiological feedback. By implementing digital emotional expressions the present study dissects the communicative act from the motor display of a facial expression and thus allows to probe mechanisms behind social interactions in real and digital worlds.",

          "abstract": "Perceptions of competence affect important social outcomes, and economic status cues embedded in clothes influence these perceptions. However, the role of individuals’ stereotypes in shaping these judgments remains unclear. This research investigates how economic status stereotypes affect competence judgments based on clothing cues across two cultural contexts. In studies conducted in Singapore (n=98) and the U.S. (n=208), participants judged the competence of individuals paired with expensive- or inexpensive-looking clothes. Participants’ economic status stereotypes were measured using questions about rich and poor people’s competence. In both studies, individuals with stronger economic status stereotypes showed a greater tendency to judge those in expensive-looking clothes as more competent. This effect manifested differently across cultures: in Singapore, it was driven by stereotypes about rich people’s competence, while in the U.S., it centered on stereotypes about poor people’s incompetence. These findings highlight how economic status stereotypes shape social perceptions universally and in culturally specific ways.",

          "abstract": "Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled the creation of chatbots that can provide warm, personalized social support, akin to human conversation partners. Yet, almost nothing is known about the long-term consequences of turning to AI for companionship. In the present study, we surveyed 2149 participants in four Western countries, tracking their chatbot use and loneliness across 12 months. Using random intercept cross-lagged panel models, we modeled within-person changes in chatbot use and loneliness across four time points. We found evidence for a bi-directional relationship: Feeling lonelier predicted increased chatbot use, and increased chatbot use, in turn, predicted increased loneliness. We urge caution, however, in drawing strong causal conclusions; our findings are akin to a smoke alarm, providing an early warning signal of a potential problem, rather than direct evidence of fire.",

          "abstract": "Much of our understanding of language processing has been informed by controlled laboratory experiments abstracted from the real world demands of naturalistic communication. Interactive language use “in the wild” involves synchronizing numerous verbal and non-verbal behaviors between interlocutors. Conversation partners synchronize verbal production through modulations of rate, amplitude, lexical-semantic complexity, affective tone, and many other dimensions. Much remains to be learned about how to measure linguistic alignment in naturalistic interactions. We developed an open-source R package (ConversationAlign) capable of computing novel indices of alignment and main effects of language use between interlocutors across 30 psycholinguistic dimensions (e.g., valence, concreteness, frequency, word length). We describe operations of the ConversationAlign workflow, including its primary functions of cleaning transcripts and transforming raw language data to simultaneous time series objects aggregated by interlocutor, turn, and conversation. We present a use case of ConversationAlign applied to interview transcripts between American radio legend, Terry Gross, and her many guests over the span of 15 years (Fresh Air Archive, 2001). We identify caveats for use and potential sources of bias (e.g., polysemy, missing data, robustness to brief language samples). We close with a discussion of potential applications to better understand lexical alignment.

          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had wide-reaching, global impacts on families that continue to be felt, particularly in education. Past research has documented changes in parents’ involvement in their children’s education during, as compared to before, the COVID-19 pandemic. It is often assumed that these changes are due to the increased burden placed on parents due to education being moved online in an effort to prevent disease spread. Despite this widely accepted assertation, the current study is the first to empirically investigate and support that the amount of time children were in online education predicted parents’ involvement in their children’s learning during the pandemic. This was done in the present preregistered study with data on 833 parents from across the United States with twin children in kindergarten through twelfth grade during the 2020-2021 school year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that parents of children who spent a higher percentage of the school year in online learning were more involved in providing schoolwork help to their children than parents of children who spent less of the school year in online education. Additionally, time spent in online education was associated with parents having less positive feelings towards their children’s school and teachers. These results held when controlling for parents’ education level and children’s grade level, each of which also predicted parental involvement. Thus, it appears that time spent in online education predicted parents’ involvement in their children’s education during the COVID-19 pandemic, but this differed by various factors of parental involvement.",

          "abstract": "Objective: During the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, a range of behavioural interventions was developed and tested (Nicola et al., 2020). These are interventions aiming to increase uptake of or adherence to health protective behaviours. This systematic review evaluates the characteristics and effects of these interventions. Methods: For the review, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL were searched for studies on behavioural interventions. Out of 690 identified articles, 35 studies were considered relevant for this review. Study quality was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2) (Higgins et al., 2019). Results: The majority of studies researched the effects of interventions on social or physical distancing, handwashing, or face coverings. Many studies explored the effects of different types of messages, for example, promoting health protective behaviours. Message-based, online interventions were most common, but largely showed small to negligible effects. Some studies explored other intervention types such as coaching sessions and found moderate to large effects. Conclusion: While the results of these studies indicate that some interventions increase adherence, large heterogeneity in study and intervention design make it difficult to interpret and compare the effects of different interventions. Both an improvement of methodological rigour and standardisation efforts are needed to make behavioural research usable for policy design.",

          "abstract": "Imagine reading a shopping list: words such as apple, banana, and pear immediately create a strong sense of coherence, forming a predictable semantic context so that when the word orange appears, it is readily anticipated. In contrast, when the list begins with only apple followed by orange, the prediction is weaker despite semantic closeness. To capture this effect experimentally, participants (n = 20) performed a lexical decision task on targets preceded by either one prime (short condition) or three semantically related primes (long condition). This design allowed us to examine how local semantic predictability accumulated across multiple primes. Our results showed that repeated exposure to semantically related primes substantially accelerated decision-making — an effect we attribute to faster evidence accumulation for semantically similar prime-target pairs, as quantified by a drift-diffusion model. Our results thus extend our understanding of language prediction to minimal contexts, demonstrating that top-down facilitation can emerge rapidly from just a few preceding items. This study advances our understanding of how prediction shapes language processing and demonstrates the relevance of hierarchical decision-making models in behavioral research.",

Relationships between other cognitive abilities and motor speech outcomes were also reported, however, there were significant gaps in the literature and heterogeneity in the measurements used. In addition, only five studies contained the highest quality evidence. Cognition, and potentially executive abilities specifically, may affect speech articulation in healthy aging and in MCI.

          "abstract": "To what degree might speech perception be affected by factors external to the speech signal? Here we consider whether listeners consider the value of individual talkers (e.g., a person that is important to the listener versus a passing stranger) when learning the idiosyncrasies of their speech, perhaps by directing their attention to the more “valuable” talker. In general, talker-specific phonetic recalibration has proven to be remarkably robust, leaving open how permeable it is to domain-general influences like attention and reward. The current study asked whether the magnitude of the talker-specific learning effect was modulated by an external reward intended to bias listeners to prioritize one talker over the other. Using an established paradigm, participants learned idiosyncratic pronunciations of the /s/ and /ʃ/ fricatives by two talkers—“Jane” and “Austin.” Over multiple experiments, participants were more likely to receive a few additional cents for one talker compared to the other following correct responses during exposure. We hypothesized that participants would show greater phonetic recalibration to the high-reward talker compared to the low-reward talker. Our results showed that participants did not show a difference in the degree of learning based on the value of each talker, suggesting that lexically guided perceptual learning is robust to external rewards. This finding opens discussions into the role of reward and attention in talker-specific phonetic recalibration, and how domain-general factors influence speech perception more broadly.",

          "abstract": "The warming of Earth’s surface temperatures poses a serious threat to the Earth’s ecosystem.  In 1996, world leaders agreed to limit this temperature rise to a maximum of 2°C above pre-industrial levels, while aiming to keep warming below 1.5°C. In order to achieve this, changes the consumption behaviours of households and individuals are needed. To encourage such change, websites have emerged which attempt to persuade individuals to adopt more sustainable behaviours.  This study explores twenty participants’ experiences using such websites.  The study employs a qualitative, longitudinal design, and utilises the think aloud method to examine the experience of using two web-based tools, Get-Greener and Climate Hero.  The study also investigates participants’ reflections on the sustainable behaviours recommended by these tools. During the two-week period, eight participants made small behavioural changes, six of which were recommended by the tools.  Key findings highlight the importance of persuasive design elements: feedback on current behaviour via footprint calculations, customised recommendations that consider personal circumstances, and ongoing support are valued by participants.  Participants preferred small, easy-to-implement ideas, highlighting barriers to larger-scale changes such as cost, limited access to sustainable alternatives, logistical issues, and a lack of clarity about what is sustainable.  Despite a general desire to adopt sustainable practices, intrinsic motivations such as convenience and financial considerations often outweighed pro-environmental intentions. Additionally, government leadership and social norms significantly influenced attitudes toward sustainability.  Participants expressed a need for clearer guidance and collective societal support to overcome these challenges.",

Participants were asked to engage in sessions of either: positive inner speech, negative inner speech, or inner counting while their heart rate was monitored. Participants were lying on a bed and asked to remain still during the inner speech trials. Motion tracking was applied to control for body movement. Median heart rate across each inner speech session was analyzed and a significant difference was found between emotional inner speech and inner counting across both experiments. No difference between positive and negative inner speech was observed. Post-hoc analyses investigated the relationship between movement and heart rate increases and found an effect with a peak lag of approximately 14 seconds. Removing these effects did not change the effect that emotional inner speech had on heart rate. In line with previous literature, additional analyses showed that heart rate and respiration rate were linked. Including respiration rate as a variable in regression analyses did not alter the effect of emotion. The effect of emotional inner speech thus seems robust. No correlations between heart rate effects and measures of depression and rumination were observed.",

          "abstract": "EEG studies show that stimuli requiring withholding a response (Nogo) elicit larger frontal N2 and frontocentral P3 event-related potentials (ERPs) than stimuli requiring a response (Go). However, the functional significance of these components remains debated due to overlapping neural processes and potential confounds in Go/Nogo tasks. One concern is that Nogo trials are typically less frequent than Go trials to induce a stronger response tendency. Since N2 and P3 are modulated by stimulus frequency, some argue that Nogo effects may reflect a response mismatch signal from infrequent Nogo trials. To test this, Eimer (1993) manipulated Go/Nogo trial frequency, using a 75/25 ratio in Experiment 1 and a 50/50 ratio in Experiment 2. While the N2 and P3 effects were numerically larger in Experiment 1, they remained robust in Experiment 2, with both components showing greater amplitudes for Nogo trials. These findings contradict the response mismatch hypothesis and emphasize the importance of equating trial frequency in Go/Nogo studies. Eimer (1993) also manipulated spatial attention to determine whether the N2 effect reflects an automatic (i.e., attention-independent) process. Results showed that N2 effects were modulated by attentional cues, ruling out a purely automatic process and highlighting the role of processes that affect initial stimulus detection and discrimination in these tasks. The present study replicates Eimer’s Experiment 2 from and assess the robustness of the results across analysis pipelines. Moreover, it will extend the original analyses by determining whether 50/50 Go/Nogo paradigms reliably induce prepotent response tendencies. As part of the #EEGManyLabs project, 5 labs will independently replicate the original study, ensuring high statistical power. Results will be integrated via meta-analysis, offering insights into the replicability of classic EEG findings and N2/P3 sensitivity to stimulus frequency and spatial attention in Go/Nogo tasks. The large dataset will serve as a valuable resource for future meta-analyses.",

          "abstract": "Background. Enduring mental health conditions typically begin in adolescence. Social adversity (e.g., discrimination, bullying, trauma) may disrupt the development of healthy social learning processes and self and other beliefs. We tested the impact of prior social adversity and current social exclusion on paranoia, self and other beliefs and latent social learning processes in UK adolescents (15-17 years, n=502), using pre-registered hypotheses (AsPredicted #154322), causal Bayesian models, and exploratory analyses. Study Design. An experimental design tested (a) whether social exclusion interacted with prior social adversity to increase paranoia, (b) whether this occurred due to activating negative self and other beliefs, and (c) whether this was moderated by cognitive flexibility (i.e., moderated-mediation). Cognitive flexibility, alongside computational processes of social information generalisation, were assessed using The Intentions Game (Barnby et al., 2024). Study Results. Social exclusion triggered paranoia, which was intensified by prior social adversity, and substantially reduced latent belief flexibility about the self and others, inhibiting learning and subduing other-to-self generalisation (social contagion). Negative self and other beliefs were a mechanism through which social adversities lead to paranoia in the context of exclusion. Prior exposure to discrimination amplified state paranoia irrespective of inclusion/exclusion. Conclusion. Social adversity enhances susceptibility to paranoia following a social exclusion manipulation, in part due to activating negative self and other beliefs. Failure to detect pro-sociality in others, impacted by the rigidly with which negative self and other beliefs are held, as well as by discrimination in particular, likely exacerbates and maintains paranoia. Findings directly inform likely profitable intervention targets.",

          "abstract": "We are witnessing exponential growth in the use of machine learning to create fake – yet indistinguishable - sexual media of others without their consent. Though there is an emerging understanding of the impact that deepfake sexual abuse (DSA) has on its victims and societal understanding thereof, this knowledge pertains entirely to individuals whose facial likeness has been used within said material, with little-to-no attention paid to those whose bodies are used as the canvas; individuals who are predominantly sex workers. Across 321 participants (Mage = 45.70 years, SD = 15.88; 48.9% female), vignettes were used to explore differences in societal judgements of DSA for victims whose face (versus body) was used to generate DSA material, and whether they were labelled as a sex worker. Though perceived criminality did not differ across conditions, participants allocated more blame and less anticipated harm to DSA victims whose body, relative to whose face, was used. This effect was enhanced in vignettes labelling them as sex workers. When exploring correlations using demographics, beliefs, and personality traits, being older, male, and viewing sex work as ‘a choice’ and/or ‘deviant’ predicted greater victim blame, lower perceived criminality, and less anticipated harm. High self-reported empathy was the only predictor of greater anticipated harm. Results indicate the importance of understanding broader impacts of DSA - regardless of the victim - for stakeholders within the criminal justice system, and a continued need to generate public awareness of DSA through international policy.",

          "abstract": "Background: Student well-being is a multidimensional construct encompassing physical and mental health. However, its assessment in educational contexts remains fragmented, failing to comprehensively understand the diverse factors that shape students’ experiences. This gap is particularly pronounced for cognitively strong students (CSS), whose unique intellectual, emotional, and social challenges are frequently overlooked by traditional approaches.\nObjective: Current work introduces a methodology - aligned with ethical scientific expectations - to develop a holistic understanding of student well-being by integrating multimodal data. The approach will uncover key patterns that influence well-being and academic performance, offering actionable insights to guide targeted interventions in educational settings.  \nMethods: The framework, developed through an extensive literature review and refined using the Delphi method, integrates three core components: physiological measures (e.g., heart rate variability and sleep data) to detect stress; self-reporting tools for qualitative insights; and survey instruments to capture psychological stressors and socio-economic influences. While broadly applicable, it emphasizes CSS-specific stressors. \nResults: We collect qualitative and quantitative data based on self-reports and physiological measures. Large language models are leveraged for sentiment analyses of qualitative data. Classic machine learning techniques analyze physiological data and integrate quantitative data from multiple modalities. This approach aims to identify patterns in stress and coping mechanisms, offering insights into broader dimensions of well-being.  \nConclusion: This research advances AI-driven educational tools, with an ethically grounded, data-driven approach to support student development, particularly for CSS.",

          "abstract": "This article builds and extends on recent work using Large Language Models (LLMs) in psychometrics to generate pseudo-discrimination parameters. While earlier work looked at pseudo-discrimination on an item-by-construct basis, we introduce pseudo-factor analysis to enhance scale design. Pseudo-factor analysis is a data-less, model-based approach to evaluating aspects of a latent construct’s measurement model, such as dimensionality and the relations between factors and their indicators. Across two studies using Five and Six-factor personality frameworks, a variety of sentence transformer models, and three encoding approaches (i.e., atomic, atomic reversed, and macro), pseudo-factor analyses recovered theoretically expected structures. These pseudo-factor structures were strongly related to their established empirical factor structures based on factor analyses of human ratings in prior published research. We suggest that Pseudo-Factor Analysis is a viable method for checking and potentially modifying scale items after item generation and before item trialing. We provide a Shiny application for calculating pseudo-factor analysis parameters and related psychometric estimates.",

          "authors": "Saanvi Kumar",
          "abstract": "Background\n\nThere is an increasing rate of comorbidity with alcoholism and mental health disorders such as anxiety disorders, especially among young adults, the demographic with the largest proportion of heavy drinkers. This study compares semaglutide, a GLP-1 drug, and naltrexone, which is FDA-approved for treating alcoholism, in treating comorbid alcoholism and anxiety using self-reported data from Reddit posts.\n\nMethods\n\nReddit API was used to extract Reddit posts relating either of the drugs (naltrexone and semaglutide) to either of the disorders (alcoholism and anxiety) as well as posts discussing the side effects of each drug. A script was created in Python to use Reddit API and automatically label the posts using a list of keywords, which was developed by running the script and manually checking portions of the data. For each drug, the effectiveness in treating a disorder was compared to ineffectiveness, and low/moderate side effects were compared to high side effects. The Chi-square test was applied to check for significance.\n\nResults\n\nAn analysis of 1,214 posts showed that Semaglutide was more effective than naltrexone at treating alcoholism as 100% of posts reported semaglutide to be effective compared to 75.67% of posts for naltrexone. Although the percentage of posts reporting the effectiveness of naltrexone for anxiety was greater at 68.97% compared to 63.83% for semaglutide, a chi-square test found that these differences were not statistically significant. Semaglutide had less intense side effects than naltrexone as 63.76% of the posts discussing semaglutide side effects found them to have a high intensity compared to 73.14% of posts discussing naltrexone side effects.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith the rising comorbid condition of anxiety with alcoholism, semaglutide is a promising alternative to naltrexone for treating patients with alcoholism. It also appears to be a safer alternative, which could encourage more people to seek out treatment. Future studies can conduct clinical trials with treatment-seeking patients to affirm it, especially for comparing the two drugs for alcohol effectiveness. Other GLP-1 drugs and other mental health disorders in alcoholism comorbidities should also be explored.",

          "abstract": "Our earliest acquired words tend to reference concrete objects that can be seen, heard, touched, and felt. One hallmark of language maturation involves an ‘abstractness shift’ where language is used to convey intangible mental states, emotions, and ideas. Much of our understanding of the trajectory of concreteness in language development ends at early adolescence and is informed by studies of comprehension. We investigated concreteness effects in language production across the span of adulthood with a focus on conversation. We tested two competing hypotheses about abstract word use in conversation as a function of normal aging. The first hypothesis is that a steady accrual of vocabulary knowledge over the lifespan will confer a more expansive abstract lexicon and that older adults will in turn produce more abstract words in conversation. An alternative hypothesis is that aging gradually compromises executive resources that impact abstract word retrieval, leading to a concreteness bias in conversation. We analyzed distributions of abstract and concrete words and cross-speaker alignment within unscripted conversations between adults of different ages (N=1565 conversations, &gt;8 million words, age range 19-66) using a novel computational algorithm (ConversationAlign). Aging was associated with abstract word dropout, a finding that is consistent with the hypothesis that high processing demands of conversation (e.g., alignment, topic maintenance) bias lexical retrieval toward concrete word use. We discuss the significance of these results for understanding intergenerational communication and relationships between aging, executive functioning, and lexical retrieval in high-level discourse.",

          "abstract": "The capacity for language constitutes a cornerstone of human cognition and distinguishes our species from other animals. Research in the cognitive sciences has demonstrated that this capacity is not bound to speech but can also be externalized in the form of sign language. Sign languages are the naturally occurring languages of the deaf and rely on movements and configurations of hands, arms, face, and torso in space. This chapter reviews the functional and structural organisation of the neural substrates of sign language as identified by neuroimaging research over the past decades. Most aspects of sign language processing in adult deaf signers markedly mirror the well-known functional left-lateralization of spoken and written language. However, both hemispheres exhibit a certain equipotentiality for processing linguistic information and the right hemisphere seems to specifically support processing of some constructions unique to the signed modality. Crucially, the so-called “core language network” in the left hemisphere constitutes a functional and structural asymmetry in typically developed deaf and hearing populations alike: This network is (i) pivotal for processing complex syntax independent of the modality of language use, (ii) matures in accordance with a genetically determined biological matrix, and (iii) may have constituted an evolutionary prerequisite for the emergence of the human capacity for language.",

          "abstract": "We encounter situations each day that require our auditory system to quickly interpret our surroundings. Auditory scene perception involves complex processes that allow us to identify both the setting and the objects within a scene, which are essential for decision-making, and situational awareness. While there is substantial evidence for distinct cortical regions and pathways supporting visual scene and object recognition, far less is known about how the brain processes complex auditory scenes and objects. This study aimed to determine whether distinct mechanisms underlie auditory setting and object identification and whether these mechanisms interact to aid perception. Participants listened to 200 natural auditory scenes of varying durations (1, 2, and 4 sec) and identified the setting (e.g., café) as well as the objects (e.g., talking, espresso machine, music) within each scene. Overall, performance was highest on the object identification task, and there was a significant interaction between task and scene duration, with a greater benefit of longer durations for the object identification task. Different low- and mid-level acoustic features of the scenes predicted performance on the two tasks. These results suggest that the auditory system employs distinct (and potentially interactive) computations for setting and object identification, allowing for quick interpretation of complex, real-world auditory scenes. The interaction between task performance and scene duration further suggests object and setting identification may operate on different temporal scales; objects might require more time for accurate individuation, while settings may be recognized more efficiently through global properties of scenes, such as openness or naturalness.",

Increasing studies examined the dynamic associations between momentary fluctuations of anxiety and well-being, primarily focusing on the severity of general anxiety. Scant research has explored the co-fluctuations between different anxiety symptoms and mental health outcomes. \nMethod: Using eight items selected from the Screen for Adult Anxiety Related Disorders (SCAARED) scale, the current study evaluated the multi-level factor structure and assessed the subclinical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia (SP), and panic disorder (PD) in a sample of non-clinical young adults (N = 271, Mage = 18 years, 72% female, 68% non-White) who participated in a 30-day daily diary study. This study also measured participants’ emotional and peer problems using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, depressive symptoms with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale, and stress by the College Chronic Life Stress Survey.\nResults: Between persons, GAD, SP, and PD were positively correlated with depressive symptoms, stress, as well as emotional and peer problems. Within persons, both SP and PD were positively associated with stress, peer and emotional problems on the same day. Across days, there was positive reciprocal relation between PD and stress, whereas negative reciprocal link was observed between SP and emotional problems. \nConclusion: Current findings showed dynamic and distinct patterns in the associations between different anxiety symptoms and several mental health outcomes, which emphasizes the need to disentangle between- and within-person variation of anxiety symptoms with intensive longitudinal designs.",

Emerging research shows that impressions are formed through a variety of mechanisms—a multimodal process rooted in different underlying systems of learning and memory. In this Perspective, I describe the roles of episodic, semantic, instrumental, and Pavlovian memory systems in impression formation and updating. By considering the unique and interactive functions of learning and memory mechanisms, this memory systems framework expands and clarifies understanding of how impressions are formed, changed, and expressed in behavior, relative to prior accounts based only on semantic memory models. This framework also illuminates longstanding debates on the nature of implicit social cognition and how social information is represented in the mind.",

          "abstract": "Research suggests there are sex differences in social cognitive abilities, with females typically performing better on tasks involving emotion recognition and mental state attribution. However, many prior studies have demonstrated limited replicability, perhaps due to differences in methods employed or samples studied. Given that social cognition is a key determinant of social functioning, and that social dysfunction represents a transdiagnostic issue in neuropsychiatric populations, understanding sex differences in social cognition among individuals with varying levels of social functioning should broaden our understanding of the etiology, expression, and treatment of psychopathology. The present study examined sex differences in gaze perception, perceptual theory of mind, and social inference abilities in a sample (n = 172; 66.8% female) of adolescents and young adults (ages 14 to 30) ranging from minimal to clinical levels of social dysfunction. Females performed better on tasks involving perceptual theory of mind and eye gaze perception, and these sex differences remained even after accounting for general cognition, age, and psychopathology. Our findings suggest that females may be more sensitive to social signals related to the eyes and may more accurately identify social signals when there is subtle or limited information available. Findings indicate the importance of recognizing sex differences in the presentation of social functioning and, by extension, socially relevant psychopathology. Such differences may have implications for tailoring treatments for social dysfunction.",

          "abstract": "Background: Hue, saturation, and brightness are critical dimensions of color perception, and art students may experience color-related emotions differently from non-art students due to either their specialized training or innate artistic sensitivity. Despite this intriguing possibility, limited research has systematically examined these differences. This study aims to investigate how art and non-art students perceive and emotionally evaluate different colors.\nMethods: Using a questionnaire-based approach, participants rated the emotional valence of colors on a 7-point semantic differential scale, ranging from very negative to very positive. The colors were carefully selected from Munsell's color system, which enabled precise manipulation of hue, brightness, and saturation levels. The study included 36 art students and 36 non-art students, who evaluated colors under controlled experimental conditions.\nResults: The findings indicate that brightness and saturation significantly influence emotional responses to colors. Warmer colors, such as orange, elicited more positive emotional evaluations, whereas cooler colors, such as blue, received less positive ratings. Notably, art students differed from non-art students in their emotional responses, with the former group showing distinct sensitivity to variations in color dimensions.\nConclusion: This study highlights that art training shapes emotional color perception, as evidenced by the differing evaluations of art and non-art students. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how artistic training influences the emotional experience of color and underscore the role of education in enhancing perceptual and emotional sensitivity to visual stimuli.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, the importance of estimating demographic biases in research has become apparent. Here we provide a systematic review of the CHILDES database, the major source of naturalistic recordings of children’s linguistic environment. We analyzed the database according to four dimensions considered central to language learning: SES, urbanization, family structure, and language. We present descriptive statistics of each dimension to assess whether naturalistic recordings were biased regarding the demographics of the countries and the families recorded within them. We find that CHILDES’s recordings overrepresented wealthier countries and higher parental education levels; urban settings; and smaller households. Middle- and higher-class participants were likewise over-represented. The corpora were not representative of their countries in terms of urbanization either - with a larger percentage of families residing in urban settings than is overall true for their respective countries. In terms of family structure, nuclear families were more prevalent than in the countries where the data was collected. Last, we found that corpora were linguistically diverse, but we estimate that these recordings underrepresent bilingual and multilingual households. We conclude that researchers should be careful when generalizing from naturalistic recordings of children's input and output obtained from CHILDES.",

          "abstract": "An increasing number of real-world interventions aim to preemptively protect or inoculate people against misinformation. Inoculation research has demonstrated positive effects on misinformation resilience when measured immediately after treatment via messages, games, or videos. However, very little is currently known about their long-term effectiveness and the mechanisms by which such treatment effects decay over time. We start by proposing three possible models on the mechanisms driving resistance to misinformation. We then report five pre-registered longitudinal experiments (Ntotal = 11,759) that investigate the effectiveness of psychological inoculation interventions over time as well as their underlying mechanisms. We find that text-based and video-based inoculation interventions can remain effective for one month—whereas game-based interventions appear to decay more rapidly—and that memory-enhancing booster interventions can enhance the diminishing effects of counter-misinformation interventions. Finally, we propose an integrated memory-motivation model, concluding that misinformation researchers would benefit from integrating knowledge from the cognitive science of memory to design better psychological interventions that can counter misinformation durably over time and at-scale.",

          "abstract": "Over the past decade, the anxiety-related attentional bias to threat, widely investigated\nthrough the dot-probe task, has faced challenges. First, at an early stage of processing, it\nremains unclear whether this bias follows a static pattern (vigilance) or fluctuates between\nvigilance and avoidance. Second, methodological and theoretical concerns have been raised\nregarding the reliability of the dot-probe task in measuring threat-related attentional bias. The\npresent study aimed to test the hypothesis of a static early expression of attentional bias to\nthreat using both a classical dot-probe task and a novel eye-dot-probe task, in which responses\nwere made via ocular saccades. Additionally, we hypothesized that the relationship between\nattentional bias to threat and anxiety follows an exponential rather than linear trajectory. Non-\nclinical participants completed both tasks along with an anxiety questionnaire. Results\nshowed no consistent relationship between anxiety and either static or fluctuating attentional\nbias in the classical dot-probe task. However, in the eye-dot-probe task, an exponential\nrelationship emerged between anxiety and static attentional bias toward threat, with a\nsignificant bias observed in high-anxious individuals. These findings provide theoretical and\nmethodological insights, suggesting that early attentional bias toward threat is static, best\ncaptured using eye-movement responses, and follows a non-linear relationship with anxiety,\nemerging only beyond a critical threshold.",

Model comparisons showed that TCC-Intrusion had a superior\nfit to memory error distributions across three delayed-estimation tasks with distraction (N = 220)\ncompared to other candidate models. According to the model, distractor intrusions decreased\nalong with target-distractor dissimilarity, in accordance with the sensory recruitment hypothesis.\nMoreover, TCC-Intrusion successfully replicated divergent effects of distraction on memory\nbias, precision, and guess using this one intrusion mechanism.

Analysis of naming response times (RTs) showed that constraining contexts enable preplanning of both lexical-semantic and phonological representations (Experiment 1). Using a picture-word interference version of the same task (Experiment 2), we found that speakers preplan the phonological form of the whole word, however, only the subset of constraining trials with the shortest RTs indicated preplanning. The results confirm previous findings from turn-taking, which suggested that speakers can complete later stages of lexical access in advance, but also highlight that the presence of preplanning varies from trial to trial.",

We used a contrastive vignette technique in two experiments (combined N = 1041, nationally representative for age, sex, and ethnicity) to study the attitudes of US participants toward a fictional character who lost 50 pounds through one of the three described methods. Weight loss through diet/exercise was deemed most effortful and most praiseworthy, whereas Ozempic use, even when combined with diet/exercise, was rated as both less effortful and less praiseworthy than diet/exercise alone. Ozempic use with no mention of diet/exercise was rated as least effortful and least praiseworthy. Compared to diet and exercise alone, Ozempic use also decreased perceptions that the individual had really changed as a person, or experienced a change in their underlying values. We discuss potential implications, address study limitations, and provide suggestions for further work.",

          "abstract": "Social video gaming has become an integral part of adolescent life, yet its impact on well-being remains unclear. This longitudinal study examines how social gaming relates to loneliness and depressive mood among adolescents, considering both within-person and between-person associations. Additionally, it explores the moderating roles of gender and age. Data were collected from a large sample of Czech adolescents across four waves, with social gaming assessed using an adapted version of the Social Interaction Potential Assessment (SIPA) tool. A random-intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) was employed to distinguish stable between-person differences from within-person fluctuations over time. Findings revealed that while adolescents who generally played more social games reported higher loneliness at the between-person level, an increase in social gaming was associated with a decrease of loneliness at the within-person level. No direct link between social gaming and depressive mood was observed. Gender differences emerged, with social gaming reducing loneliness and depressive mood for boys but increasing both for girls at within-person level. Additionally, younger adolescents were more likely to increase social gaming in response to depressive mood, whereas older adolescents showed the opposite pattern. These results suggest that while social gaming may provide temporary relief from loneliness, particularly for boys, it may also reflect underlying vulnerabilities, especially for girls. The findings highlight the need for a nuanced understanding of social gaming’s role in adolescent well-being, considering individual differences in gender and age.",

          "abstract": "There are large differences across individuals in the ability to perceive foreign-accented speech, and the sources of this variability are poorly understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that individual differences in auditory processing help drive variability in accented speech perception. We asked L1 English speakers to perceive prosodic features in Mandarin-accented English. Individuals who could precisely discriminate pitch and accurately remember melodic sequences, and who placed more emphasis on pitch information during prosodic categorization, were better able to perceive accented speech. Individuals with more musical training also demonstrated enhanced accented speech perception. Finally, we found that better accented speech perception was linked to more robust neural encoding of speech harmonics. These findings suggest that the precision of sound perception and robustness of memory for sound sequences are major factors driving variability in accented speech perception, and so auditory training could potentially help remediate poor perception of accented speech.",

          "abstract": "To perceive speech listeners must decide how to prioritize information from multiple acoustic dimensions. Over the course of language learning, individuals form stable perceptual strategies which reflect the strength of the statistical relationship between values along particular acoustic dimensions and linguistic categories. However, despite this underlying stability, listeners respond to evidence about shifts in the reliability of acoustic dimensions as cues to categorization, changing their strategies. Here we show that such changes are maximally efficient: listeners will adjust after hearing just a single stimulus in which the relationship between acoustic cues diverges from the expected pattern. Furthermore, these shifts in strategy vanish as quickly as they appear, lasting only a single trial before returning to baseline. Finally, we show that shifts in cue weighting are resistant to distraction, occurring equally when speech is presented in quiet versus in informational masking. Speech perception strategies, therefore, are characterized by short-term fluctuation and long-term stability.",

While research has established that user beliefs, or an artificial agent’s appearance, can shape social outcomes with artificial agents, little is known about how these factors interact. We used virtual reality (VR) with eye- and motion-tracking, to examine the extent to which people attend to and use an agent’s gaze in a collaborative task. Participants initiated and responded to joint attention bids using hand gestures, while coordination could be implicitly facilitated by attending to the agent’s eye gaze. However, this did not result in any behavioural differences. Participants persistently used these gaze cues, reflected in coordination accuracy, face-looking frequency, and reaction times. Participants who *believed* their partner was human, rather than an AI system, subjectively reported more gaze-following and positive social experiences. When the agent *looked* like a human, rather than a robot, participants looked less frequently at the eyes, responded faster, and reported more negative social experiences. Our data suggests that social AI systems are approached more like humans than computers, irrespective of explicit beliefs about their humanness. Furthermore, when the artificial agent appeared in a non-human form, believing that it was human- rather than AI-controlled improved subjective experiences, highlighting how beliefs about AI systems may shape subjective social outcomes. This suggests that disclosure around the true intentional stance of artificial agents (e.g., in online VR contexts) may be important for shaping subjective social outcomes.",

Across two samples collected in separate countries (UK and Germany; N = 658 and 972 respectively), a large number of male and female names were rated on multiple social traits, with mean trait ratings for each name then being entered into a Principal Components Analysis. In both samples, and for both male and female names, the same four component structure was found: these included components corresponding with valence/warmth, dominance/competence, age, and familiarity. We propose that this four component model could provide an overarching theoretical framework that could help unite research on name bias and generate new testable hypotheses.",

          "abstract": "Loneliness is a pressing global health issue, yet traditional interventions often fall short due to scalability limitations and the individualized experiences of loneliness. The rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled synthetic relationships (SRs)—ongoing associations with AI companions designed to simulate human-like social bonds. SRs offer, among other aspects, constant availability, adaptability, and emotional responsiveness, which potentially address loneliness. However, their growing integration into social life raises critical psychological, ethical, and societal questions. This paper examines the opportunities and risks of SRs through the lens of relationship science, psychology, and AI companionship research. We first highlight how existing loneliness interventions face the challenges of availability, scalability, and personalization. We then outline how SRs present a novel alternative to overcoming these challenges. Drawing mainly on social penetration, attachment, and interdependence theory, we analyze how SRs may foster companionship, reduce social anxiety, and improve interpersonal skills, potentially mitigating loneliness. However, we also identify significant risks, including emotional over-reliance, distorted social expectations, and privacy concerns. The widespread adoption of SRs may reshape human-human relationships, altering norms of intimacy and social connection. To navigate these challenges, we outline a research agenda promoting interdisciplinary theory development longitudinal studies, drawing on representative samples to address the ethical concerns of SRs. We argue that SRs hold promise as a social intervention when ensuring they complement rather than replace human relationships.

          "authors": "Samuli Kangaslampi; Morten P. Lietz",
          "abstract": "Rationale\n\nSince the earliest LSD research, psychedelics have been claimed to enhance autobiographical memory. Revisiting and processing autobiographical memories has further been suggested to be a major component of the therapeutic action of psychedelics. However, modern psychedelic research has largely neglected autobiographical elements of psychedelic experiences, and many vital questions remain unanswered.\n\nObjectives\n\nWe present and discuss six open questions related to psychedelics and autobiographical memory: 1. Do psychedelics enhance autobiographical recall? 2. Is recall and processing of significant autobiographical (e.g., traumatic) memories a common part of psychedelic experiences? 3. Do psychedelics promote the development of false or inaccurate memories? 4. How do autobiographical memories change if they are recalled and reconsolidated under the effects of psychedelics? 5. What are memories of psychedelic experiences like? 6. Are autobiographical experiences under psychedelics of particular importance for their therapeutic effects?\n\nResults\n\nWe present the background and current limited state of evidence for each question and provide suggestions on how future studies could best address them. \n\nConclusions\n\nBesides advancing basic research, answering these pressing questions is highly relevant for the possible therapeutic use of psychedelics, both in terms of developing and optimizing new interventions and for avoiding iatrogenic harms. Ideally, future psychedelic-assisted interventions could harness the possible synergies between the effects of psychedelics and existing memory-based therapies.\n\nKeywords: Psychedelics, autobiographical memory, LSD, psilocybin",

          "abstract": "Successful personalized treatment requires a thorough understanding of the complex dynamic processes underlying disorders. Intensive longitudinal methods (e.g., experience sampling) that ask patients to complete multiple-item questionnaires several times a day are ideally suited for this. However, collecting such data entails severe patient burden, especially for those with low energy and little concentration (e.g., patients suffering from Chronic Cancer-Related Fatigue and/or psychological disorders such as Somatic Symptom Disorder). This burden is currently predominantly lightened with single-item measures, but these cannot validly capture complex conditions, leading to a catch-22 situation: Capturing complex dynamic processes and effective personalized treatment require intensive longitudinal patient data on multiple-item questionnaires, but patients cannot provide this type of data because it is too taxing. To solve this problem, we developed a personalized missingness design that presents an individualized and time-varying minimal subset of items on each occasion, thereby striking an optimal balance between thoroughly mapping patients’ symptoms and keeping the number of items a person needs to answer to a minimum. The design builds on multilevel factor analyses to determine which sets of items are most informative, which can change over time. Expert-informed simulations validated our new design. While the design can be universally applied to any measurement of (psychological) symptoms (e.g., to inform cognitive behavioral therapy), we tailored our simulations to patients suffering from Chronic Cancer-Related Fatigue in collaboration with experts in Psycho-Oncology. In the near future, the design will be implemented in the widely used experience sampling app m-Path in collaboration with the developers.",

          "authors": "Bowen Xiao; Noham Wolpe",
          "abstract": "Effort is a critical component of daily goal pursuit, both as the work invested in achieving a goal and as the subjective experience that accompanies it. While the roles of work and reward have been extensively studied in decision-making, relatively little is known about the influence of other cognitive and motor contributors when selecting between actions. Progress feedback, i.e., information on one’s progress towards a goal, has been suggested to be intrinsically valuable. In this pre-registered study, we tested whether people preferred physical work involving progress feedback, even when it was accompanied by more work. We further examined whether preference for progress feedback could be explained by lower perceived effort, improved effort exertion characteristics, or mental health factors. Participants (n=114) performed an online effort-based decision-making task, choosing between options with progress feedback (PF+) or with no progress feedback (PF-). We recorded continuous movements during effort exertion with mouse-tracking. Overall, participants preferred to receive progress feedback. Preference for progress was positively associated with social motivation, as measured using the Apathy Motivation Index, but not with traits previously linked to information seeking. At a group-level, participants did not rate PF+ trials as less effortful compared to PF-. Progress feedback did not improve effort exertion efficiency, as movements in PF+ were more variable and less smooth than movements in PF-. These results suggest that progress feedback is innately valuable despite its potential costs. The correlation with social motivation highlights a potential link to external validation, which warrants testing in future studies.",

          "abstract": "Objective \nA previous study (Iha, 2023) showed that division of labor occurs spontaneously when a man and a woman are simply paired. It also showed that when division of labor does occur, men undertake more costly tasks than women. However, it is still unclear whether men always undertake high-cost tasks and women always avoid such tasks. Therefore, it was examined when men and women do and do not undertake a high-cost task. \n\nMethods \nUsing an online scenario experiment, 1247 participants from four countries were randomly assigned to one of two conditions (compete/choose) to determine whether participants differed in their likelihood of making a high-cost choice depending on the relationship with their imaginary opposite-sex partner. \n\nResults \nOverall, men were more likely than women to make a high-cost choice, and both men and women who participated in the compete condition (participant loved their imaginary opposite-sex partner) were more likely to make a high-cost choice than those who participated in the choose condition (participant was loved by their imaginary opposite-sex partner). In addition, all observed effects were consistent across the four countries. \n\nConclusion \nThe results of the current study support the mutual mate choice model in that women can be competitive to obtain a desirable mate, but also support the males-compete/females-choose model in that men overall have a greater tendency to compete for a potential mate.",

          "authors": "Yuqing Shi; DongWon Oh",
          "abstract": "First impressions from faces present inherent uncertainties, forcing people to make quick personality assessments with limited information. People vary in how they handle this uncertainty, with some experiencing greater discomfort in ambiguous situations. We propose that individuals with higher uncertainty avoidance process facial impressions in a more fine-grained manner, suggesting a specific cognitive strategy to manage this uncertainty. Across two studies, we found that both individuals (Study 1: N = 105) and cultures (Study 2: N = 10,552, 40 regions) with higher uncertainty avoidance formed more distinctly separated personality trait impressions from faces. The relationship between uncertainty avoidance and impression separation was mediated by the strength of trait concept dissociations that individuals held (Study 1). This tendency to separate different personality traits may help reduce the ambiguity of social judgments. Our findings reveal how even basic cognitive tendencies shape social perception at both individual and cultural levels.",

Collectively, however, the boundaries among these variables remain unclear. In the current research, we examined the extent to which measures of relationship quality and other important relationship constructs are empirically separable from one another. Across two studies of US census-matched participants (total N = 3,439), we applied latent variable techniques (e.g., exploratory bifactor analysis) on broad pools of items representing various prominent relationship-specific constructs. Results revealed robust evidence that a single general factor Q (representing global relationship sentiment) accounts for a vast majority of common variance across distinct relationship measures. Thus, respondents appear to draw primarily on their overall global relationship evaluations when reporting on an array of presumably-distinct relationship facets. This is consistent with a ‘sentiment override’ perspective. Our findings provide novel empirical evidence for a relationship-specific response bias that challenges prevailing assumptions and practice in the field, including the widespread use of self-report methods to capture meaningful aspects of relationship functioning.",

          "abstract": "Flora et al. (1992) found that intense noise increased impulsive responses during a task in which college students chose between smaller-sooner (SS) and larger-later (LL) options to earn points exchangeable for money (SS – impulsive option; LL – self-control option). Furthermore, the removal of the aversive noise did not result in increments in LL responses, and vice versa (i.e., self-control preference continued when the noise was later introduced). Considering human physiological responses to pictures of human mutilation resemble those produced by aversive stimuli (e.g., heart rate changes), we explored if the disruptive effects of aversive stimuli on self-control behavior could be reproduced with images of mutilation. Matching-to-sample trials depicting the images of mutilation were interspersed between the choice trials with different probabilities (Random-Time 0 s, 20 s, and 30 s). A delay-discounting task was introduced before and after the choice task to obtain k and Area Under the Curve (AUC) values, which were used to explore a relationship with performance during the choice task. A within-subjects design with 24 participants was implemented. Each probability of matching mutilation images was an experimental condition. Initial exposure to high probability of matching overall produced indifference (~ 50% LL responses). Proportion of LL responses increased when the probability of the images was reduced. Participants not initially exposed to the images developed preference for the self-control option and maintained it during subsequent conditions when probability of matching images changed. Delay-discounting measures were not related to performance during the choice task, possibly because of a magnitude effect (smaller reinforcers are discounted more steeply than larger reinforcers). Future studies must address the divergent results in this line of research, especially the fact that noise and visual stimulation produced mostly indifference, whereas cold water (Flora et al., 2003) is the only stimulus that has been shown to increase impulsive choice beyond indifference.",

Here we use multiple methods (N = 5,376) to test an intriguing claim entailed by this work: People think that women are morally superior to men. Using reverse-correlation methods, we show that mental representations of the face of “a morally good person” is a woman’s face. Next, using a novel profile-generation task, we find that people are more likely to ascribe more morally good traits to women than to men, both when they are spontaneously thinking of a woman (vs. a man) and when they are assigned to do so. Further, using a large database of 1,864 normed behaviors, we find that behaviors associated with moral goodness are also stereotyped as feminine. Finally, we use a novel impression updating task to explore a potential consequence of this phenomenon. Specifically, we find that immoral behavior is more diagnostic for women than men. As a result, equivalent moral transgressions lead to larger negative character updating for women than for men. In sum, these findings reveal that moral goodness is closely linked to gender concepts: people think women are morally superior to men.",

          "abstract": "Of the 330 million residents of the United States, over 40 million were born abroad. Such individuals are routinely referred to using labels such as “alien,” “foreigner,” and “noncitizen.” In this multimethod project relying on data from 5,437 U.S. citizens in experimental studies and 193,649 U.S. citizens in archival studies, we examine implicit (automatic) evaluations of non-Americans in the United States, their effects on impression formation, and their ecological correlates in the form of real-life outcomes. In Studies 1A–1C, the labels “alien,” “foreigner,” and “noncitizen” were found to be highly and similarly implicitly negative. In Studies 2A–2D, applying these labels to specific individuals created immediate implicit negativity toward them, irrespective of their gender or race. Finally, pro-American/anti-foreigner implicit evaluations predicted anti-immigrant policy positions at the level of individuals (Study 3A), and a conceptually and statistically related implicit White–American/Asian–foreign implicit stereotype predicted anti-immigrant voting patterns in 18 relevant ballot initiatives at the level of U.S. counties (Study 3B). Across studies, implicit anti-foreigner bias generalized across participant demographics but was somewhat stronger among men and political conservatives. Together, this work highlights the cognitive underpinnings and real-world correlates of robust and pervasive anti-foreigner biases in the United States.",

          "abstract": "Background:\nThe recent increase in online health information-seeking prompted extensive user appraisal of encountered content. Information consumption depends crucially on the quality of encountered information and the user’s ability to evaluate it; yet, within the context of online, organic search behavior, few studies take into account both these aspects simultaneously.\n\nObjectives:\nWe aimed to explore a method to bridge these two aspects and grant even consideration to both the stimulus (webpage content) and the user (ability to appraise encountered content). We examined novices and experts in information retrieval and appraisal to demonstrate a novel approach to studying Information Foraging Theory: Stimulus-Engagement Alignment (SEA).\n\nMethods:\nWe sampled from experts and novices in information retrieval and assessment, asking participants to conduct a 10-minute search task with a specific information goal. We employed an observational and a retrospective think-aloud protocol to collect data within the framework of an interview. Data from three streams (think-aloud, human-computer interaction, and screen content) were manually coded in the ROCK standard and subsequently aligned and represented in a tabularized format with the R package {rock}. SEA scores were derived from designated code co-occurrences in specific segments of data within the stimulus data stream versus the think-aloud and human-computer interaction data streams. \n\nResults:\nSEA scores represented a meaningful comparison of what participants encountered and what they engaged with. Operationalizing codes as either “present” or “absent” in a particular data stream allowed us to inspect not only which credibility cues participants engaged with the most frequency, but also whether participants noticed the absence of cues. Code co-occurrence frequencies could thus indicate case-, time-, and context-sensitive information appraisal that also takes into account the quality of information encountered.\n\nDiscussion:\nEmploying SEA allowed us to retain epistemic access to idiosyncratic manifestations of both stimuli and engagement, but also, via utilizing the same coding scheme and designated co-occurrences across participants, be able to pinpoint trends within our sample and subsamples. We believe our approach lends a powerful analysis encompassing the breadth and depth of data, both on par with each other in the feat of understanding organic, online search behavior.",

          "abstract": "Co-rumination, defined as when individuals perseverate on problems with each other, focus excessively on negative feelings, and cyclically discuss the causes and consequences of problems, is often examined from the perspective of the person seeking support about a problem or by averaging both dyad members’ individual ratings of co-rumination. This approach muddles how each dyad member contributes to the “co” of co-rumination and may have implications for understanding prior work that has shown associations between co-rumination and intrapersonal and interpersonal well-being. We leveraged state space grids to examine co-rumination as a dyadic and dynamic system, as constituted by the temporal unfolding of each dyad member’s self-rated social rumination throughout their discussion. From 2019-2020, 85 primarily White and female college-aged close friend dyads engaged in a support discussion. After, friends viewed their recorded discussion and rated their individual contributions to the co-rumination process (i.e., social rumination) every 30 seconds across the eight-minute conversation. Results revealed that the more both dyad members got “stuck” engaging in mutually high social rumination (i.e., co-rumination), the more they perceived each other as responsive and supportive and viewed the problem as more solved. In contrast, the more that only the person disclosing the problem was stuck in high levels of social rumination or when dyads more flexibly engaged in social rumination, the more individuals with the problem benefited from the conversation, but responders benefited less. Examining co-rumination dyadically and dynamically can reveal when and for whom co-rumination processes are associated with costs and benefits.",

          "abstract": "The pleasurable urge to move to music (“groove”) has been shown to be greatest for moderately complex musical rhythms. This is thought to occur because temporal predictions from the motor system reinforce our perception of the beat when there is a balance between expectation and surprise. The supplementary motor area (SMA) has been identified as the potential origin of these temporal predictions. Thus, to causally test the role of the SMA in the experience of groove, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to disrupt activity in this region or an active control site (V1) before and after non-musicians listened to and rated musical clips that varied in rhythmic complexity and perceived groove. Following stimulation over left SMA, participants preferred moving to music with higher rhythmic complexity while after V1 stimulation, they preferred moving to music with lower rhythmic complexity. Pleasure ratings, however, were unaffected. These results suggest that the SMA weighs the precision of beat-based predictions generated by the dorsal auditory stream. Therefore, stimulating the left SMA may have disinhibited either the dorsal striatum or other nodes generating the beat-based predictions themselves. In summary, these findings provide causal evidence that the SMA plays a critical role in embodied rhythm processing.",

We propose a distracted-from-doing-good hypothesis: compared with distraction-free environments, distracting environments lead people to rely more on the default options, particularly self-serving ones. In a preregistered experiment, participants made repeated allocation decisions involving monetary trade-offs between personal gain and charity donations. We manipulated the default type (prosocial vs. self-serving), the presence (vs. absence) of distractions and measured individual differences in mind wandering and social value orientation. Results did not support the hypothesis but offered valuable insights: On average, participants were more likely than chance to accept prosocial defaults, and they accept more prosocial than self-serving defaults. We found evidence that some individuals use self-serving defaults to justify selfish decisions, particularly those with a prosocial orientation. Interestingly, the aggregate effects were driven by 60 percent of participants; the remaining 40 percent were uninfluenced by defaults, acting according to their social preferences. Individual differences in mind wandering—how easily one is distracted—further moderate the default effects. We discuss how the results inform our understanding of prosocial behaviors in combination with individual heterogeneity and how defaults are a good tool to promote overall prosociality.",

          "abstract": "Before the 2020 and 2024 U.S. Presidential elections, several scientific journals publicly endorsed the Democratic candidates or opposed the Republican candidate. We conducted three highly-powered, pre-registered online experiments (N = 6,281) to examine how these endorsements affected trust in science.

          "authors": "Qiang Xie; Victoria Amo; Inbal Nahum-Shani; Simon Goldberg",
          "abstract": "Objectives: Meditation-based interventions (MBIs) hold promise for enhancing health and well-being. However, substantial barriers impede engagement in traditional forms of these interventions. Innovations in mobile health offer an avenue for overcoming barriers associated with traditional MBIs. This paper examines the potential of a particular mobile health innovation – Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMIs) – as a strategy to enhance the accessibility, acceptability, and efficacy of MBIs. Methods: We discuss the historical context, conceptual foundations, motivation for adoption, and empirical evidence supporting the potential of EMIs. Additionally, we explore the conceptual intersections between EMIs and both traditional contemplative sources and contemporary secular MBIs. Furthermore, we describe empirical studies integrating EMIs into MBIs (i.e., meditation-based [MB]-EMIs). Results: Studies have demonstrated diverse approaches to integrating EMIs into MBIs. These studies exhibit variability in key dimensions, including the MBI with which the EMI is integrated and the characteristics of the EMI itself. MB-EMIs have therapeutic potential, but there are many important scientific questions about them that have not yet been answered. Discussion: Future studies should continue to examine the impact and safety of meditation-based EMIs, leverage innovations in passive data collection, explore user experiences, develop these interventions for and with marginalized populations, and emphasize informal meditation practice.",

          "abstract": "Well-being is often defined in terms of a person’s comfort, happiness, functioning and flourishing. Scholars distinguish subjective well-being (i.e., perceiving one’s life as pleasant) from psychological well-being (i.e., perceiving one’s life as meaningful). Advances in natural language processing have yielded automated assessments of psychological states and traits from language alone, including subjective well-being. However, the strength of these tools for assessing psychological well-being remains unstudied. Across three studies (one preregistered), we examined the strength of language-based assessments of self-reported subjective and psychological well-being components. Participants gave verbal or written responses to queries regarding their satisfaction with life and autonomy, along with questionnaire measures of subjective and psychological well-being. We then tested the strength of contextual word embeddings generated from AI-based transformers applied to verbal responses in predicting self-reported satisfaction with life and psychological well-being. Predictions generated from word embeddings of open-ended assessments correlated significantly with questionnaire measures of corresponding well-being constructs (rs = .16 &lt; r &lt; .63) and they also generalized across well-being components (rs = .15 &lt; r &lt; .50). However, the strength of these relations was lower than previous studies (rs = .72 &lt; r &lt; .85), and sense of autonomy was consistently less predictable than satisfaction with life. These findings demonstrate that although linguistic measures can significantly correlate with one’s sense of autonomy, it appears to be more challenging to assess than other forms of well-being.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Mental health issues among international students are concerning. However, international students tend to underutilize and benefit less from traditional mental health services compared to their domestic counterparts. The current paper proposes digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) as a promising approach to bridge mental health inequities faced by international students. Methods: We explore the definition, types, and efficacy of DMHIs. We outline the unique promise of these interventions in reducing barriers to health service access encountered by international students. To illustrate these points, we discuss example studies of DMHIs for international students. Results: Recent studies have supported the potential benefits of DMHIs for improving international students’ psychological distress, well-being, and help-seeking outcomes. However, many scientific questions remain unsolved. Discussion: To optimize the potential of these interventions for international students, researchers should conduct well-powered randomized controlled trials, examine correlates of intervention use, design single-session interventions, co-develop interventions with the international student community, integrate interventions within the larger system, incorporate ecological momentary assessment and digital phenotyping, and leverage immersive and interactive digital technology.",

          "abstract": "Filtering is a cognitive mechanism that regulates how information is encoded into working memory. It minimizes the retention of irrelevant information while facilitating the maintenance of task-relevant information. While prior studies have examined the filtering of task-irrelevant distractors, it remains unclear whether information that needs to be briefly processed—but not maintained—can be partially filtered out. To address this, we developed a novel complex-span task involving three conditions: a pre-cue condition, where stimuli are identified as memory items or distractors before they are processed thus allowing for filtering; a retro-cue condition, where this information is given only after processing, preventing filtering; and a control condition without distractors. Across three experiments, memory performance in the pre-cue condition was comparable to the retro-cue condition but worse than the control condition. Additionally, using the Memory Measurement Model (Oberauer &amp; Lewandowsky, 2019), we estimated the memory strength of distractors and found the same strength of distractors retained in working memory in both pre- and retro-cue conditions. These findings suggest that information requiring processing cannot be selectively filtered out during encoding into working memory.",

Yet, it is to date unclear how precisely relevant factors are shaping referential choice and which of these are most important during discourse production across languages. Using computational modeling on a naturalistic corpus of spoken narratives across 16 diverse languages, we systematically investigated the predictability of 16 functional factors on referential choice. We moreover used a novel technique from explainable artificial intelligence to get precise insights into the decision making processes of our models, in order to draw inferences on the precise relationship of the factors with referential choice. We show that 1) referential choice is multifactorial, 2) anaphoric distance, referent salience in local discourse, and syntactic function a referent is allocated to, are most predictive of referential form, 3) many other factors discussed prominently in the literature, like referent competition, topic persistence or the presence of agreement, have little to no predictive power, 4) and that these factors are generally shared across languages, with large differences across languages mostly pertaining to idiosyncratic properties of languages, such as word order or the expression of nominal number. Our study is the first large-scale study of referential choice across diverse languages using naturalistic corpus data.",

In two experiments (N = 187), participants interacted with members of two groups in an interactive social decision task. Prior to the task, participants were exposed to positive or negative group stereotypes that were moral or nonmoral in content. Although players from each group were, on average, equally likely to provide reward feedback, participants formed choice preferences for players from positively-stereotyped over negatively-stereotyped groups. Importantly, this effect was stronger and more resistant to change when stereotypes contained moral content. Computational modeling indicated that moral stereotypes induced more extreme initial reward expectancies and influenced how reward associations were updated over time. Additionally, moral stereotypes generalized more strongly to subsequent evaluations of novel group members, suggesting that the biasing effect of moral stereotypes on learning contributed to group-level prejudice.",

          "abstract": "We have recently found that during naturalistic encoding (freely viewing images without knowing a memory test will follow) bigger images are remembered 1.5 times better than smaller images. These results supported our hypothesis that larger images recruit more visual system processing resources from earliest processing stages, and this leads to higher quality signals transferred downstream to higher visual- and memory-related areas resulting in better memory. It is unclear, however, if these results represent naturalistic vision outside the lab. Here in a more naturalistic-like and less-controlled online experiment (n=132) we successfully replicated our lab-based findings and consistently found that larger images were remembered more than 1.7 times better than smaller images. Our replication (performed on desktops and laptops) provides stronger evidence that bigger images are better remembered in more naturalistic-like environments outside the lab. These results provide initial insights on how visual physical salience affects cognitive performance during everyday visual behavior. Given the enormous increase in usage of handheld devices for multiple everyday purposes as communications with practitioners and education it is valuable to investigate in future studies how visual physical salience transferred through such communication channels influences perception, comprehension, learning, and memory.",

          "abstract": "The capacity for voluntary action is a distinctive feature of human minds. However, experimental studies of volition struggled to capture defining features of human voluntariness. Here we developed a competitive game which incentivised participants to innovate their action choices to find the right time to avoid a collision with an opponent who predicted the timing of the participant’s action choice. One group of participants received explicit information about the competitor’s action-selection rules, while a second group had no information about the competitor. Both groups showed increased behavioural stochasticity when adapting to a competitor who punished participant’s choice biases. However, the group who had no explicit information generated their action choices in a way that avoided the action that the competitor was likely to take. In contrast, the group who explicitly knew the competitor’s action-selection rules avoided the same action they took in preceding trials so that the competitor could not easily exploit the participant’s behavioural patterns. These findings suggest that people can develop beliefs about other agents in the social environment within which they work, and can adapt voluntary action choices accordingly. However, explicit explanations about the other agent facilitate model-based planning in the voluntary generation of novel action patterns.",

This is a well-replicated effect, demonstrated across a wide variety of task factors and age groups. However, it is not clear if individuals with symptoms of ADHD are able to do this effectively, as there is some evidence this group struggle to allocate attention in working memory tasks. Two experiments were conducted online to investigate this. Participants were presented with series of four coloured shapes, and asked to report the colour of each shape in a counterbalanced order following a brief delay. In some trials (equal value condition), all shapes were equally valuable with the correct recall of each shape gaining the participant 2 points. In other trials (differential value condition), the first item presented during the encoding phase was more valuable than the rest (5 point for the first item vs 1 point for the other items). Trial-by-trial feedback was either provided (Experiment 1) or omitted (Experiment 2). Across both experiments, there was a clear prioritization effect at the first (targeted) serial position, with higher accuracy in the differential value condition relative to the equal value condition. There were also clear costs at some of the less valuable serial positions. These effects did not differ as a function of ADHD symptoms. There were also no significant correlations between scores on the Adult ADHD Self-Report Screener and the prioritization effects. Taken together, this demonstrates that the ability to prioritize particularly valuable information in working memory is not impaired in individuals with symptoms of ADHD.",

Traditionally, joint attention has been experimentally investigated by means of the gaze cueing task in screen-based settings. Recently, the gaze cueing task has been implemented in more naturalistic and interactive settings with the embodied iCub robot, allowing for the investigation of concurrent factors influencing joint attention. Previous studies found that a communicative gaze before the gaze cue (i.e., mutual or avoiding gaze with the participants) influenced the subsequent joint attention by eliciting the gaze-cueing effect only in the mutual gaze condition. In the present work, we first manipulated the attribution of the intentional stance toward the robot by letting participants share a familiar context. Subsequent to this shared experience, we integrated the gaze-cueing paradigm with the iCub robot, such that the robot cued participants’ attention after establishing either mutual or avoiding gaze with them. In contrast to previous studies where the adoption of the intentional stance was not manipulated, our current results show that when the robot was perceived as an intentional agent, a gaze-cueing effect was present for both mutual and avoiding gaze, thereby suggesting that participants might have interpreted both gaze conditions as intentional (and, thus as communicative signals).",

Eye contact and repeated averted gaze shifts are key cues for gaze-based communication and joint attention, but it remains unclear how the temporal and perceptual dynamics of these gaze cues combine to signal an interlocutor's intention to communicate. This study examines three key perceptual properties of dynamic eye gaze displays, and the extent to which they influence the perception of communicative intent. Both autistic (n = 126) and non-autistic (n = 118) participants completed a semi-interactive task with an on-screen agent that displayed dynamic eye movements on each trial searching for a target among three objects. Participants had to decide whether the agent was privately inspecting the objects or requesting the participant to ‘give’ them one of the blocks (i.e., attempting to communicate). Across trials, we manipulated whether the agent displayed eye contact and made repeated averted gaze shifts at the same object and the duration of gaze displays. We measured the frequency of ‘give’ responses (indexing perceived communicative intent) and reaction times (indexing response certainty). Participants were most likely to perceive communicative intent when the agent displayed eye contact and repeated averted gaze shifts. Gaze duration was a less potent signal of communicative intent. However, longer gaze durations increased perceptions of communicative intent in the absence of eye contact and repeated averted gaze displays. Autistic and non-autistic participants exhibited similar overall patterns, challenging the traditional view of autism as a condition in which people have a reduced tendency to understand the social meaning of gaze cues.",

Music training improved fine-motor skills and auditory memory relative to controls, but it had no effect on emotion recognition or other cognitive and socioemotional abilities. Both music and basketball training improved gross-motor skills. Study 2 (N = 192) compared children without music training to peers attending a music school. Although music training correlated with better emotion recognition in speech prosody (tone of voice), this association disappeared after controlling for socioeconomic status, musical abilities, or short-term memory. In contrast, musical abilities correlated with emotion recognition in both prosody and faces, independently of training or other confounding variables. These findings suggest that music training enhances fine-motor skills and auditory memory, but it does not causally improve emotion recognition, cognitive abilities, or socioemotional functioning. Observed advantages in emotion recognition likely stem from preexisting musical abilities and other confounding factors such as socioeconomic status.",

          "abstract": "Misinformation continues to pose a challenge to information integrity, making it critical to\nidentify novel ways to reduce its spread. Building on previous intervention studies, we\ninvestigated the role of creating misleading headlines as an inoculation strategy to improve\nsubsequent truth discernment in an online mixed (pre-post within and between-groups) preregistered\ndesign. Indian participants (N = 646, 388 men, 255 women, Mage = 30.46 years) were\nassigned to one of the three conditions: misinformation (active generation of misleading\nheadlines based on common tactics used in fake news), depict (passive reading of these tactics),\nor a control group (no intervention). Discernment was measured based on reliability, sharing\nintention, and confidence ratings on true and false headlines, presented before and after the\nintervention. Both misinformation and depict conditions improved truth discernment, but\nintervention effects were cancelled out when individual difference variables of political ideology\nand dark personality traits were added in models. Overall, there were imprecise intervention\neffects of both conditions, where sharing intention was reduced, but for all headlines, not just\nfalse ones. In the misinformation condition, headlines created by participants were also rated for\nfluency, creativity, valence, and task-appropriateness. More creative and misleading headlines\nwere associated with lower sharing in general on the post-test, indicating greater caution in\nsharing any news, reflective of critical evaluation. Future research can refine this intervention to\nassess its effectiveness over time and across contexts.",

          "abstract": "Perceptual content is integrated as it unfolds in real-time within temporal windows. Understanding the dynamics of temporal integration requires understanding influences by an ongoing temporal context. Towards this goal, we developed a novel paradigm of temporal integration where two halves of a Kanizsa square are integrated together (seen as a full square) or segregated (not seen as a full square) as a function of temporal gap between them. The two halves are embedded within a preceding and succeeding context of rotating Kanizsa discs leading up to and trailing away from them. We wanted to investigate whether integration is subject to frames of interest or whether the dynamics of the context influence form-part integration. Through three experiments, we manipulated the nature of the rotation: (1) the context being temporally correlated or random in Experiment 1, (2) variance of the temporally correlated context in Experiment 2, and (3) mean of the temporally correlated context in Experiment 3. Our results showed that the sensitivity of seeing an integrated square was better when the context aided anticipation of the target frames, the effect being selective at different ISIs depending on the properties of the context. We interpret these results in the light of a probabilistic view of temporal windows of integration. Our results provide evidence for an inherent adaptiveness in the extent or window of temporal integration. The results also reinforce the general account of extended temporal processing and iterative updating and inform rough timescales of context effects on this process.",

          "abstract": "The evolution of music, speech, and sociality have been debated since before Darwin. The social bonding hypothesis proposes that these phenomena may be interlinked: musicality may have facilitated the evolution of social bonding beyond the possibilities of spoken language. Although dozens of experimental studies have argued that synchronised rhythms can promote bonding, methodological issues including publication bias, sample bias, experimenter effects, and appropriateness of experimental controls make it unclear whether synchronous singing reliably and generally enhances bonding relative to speaking. Here, we propose a Registered Report to overcome these issues through a global experiment in diverse languages aiming to collect data from 1800 participants across 60 sites. The social bonding hypothesis predicts that bonding will increase more after synchronous singing than after spoken (sequential) conversation or (simultaneous) recitation, while alternative hypotheses predict that song will not increase bonding relative to speech. Regardless of outcome, these results will provide an unprecedented understanding of cross-cultural relationships between music, speech, and sociality.",

          "authors": "Berthine Ommensen; Kate Sofronoff; Tony Attwood; Nancy A. Pachana",
          "abstract": "Background\nMuch of the research on autistic ageing is framed by what is known about the developmental trajectory of autism throughout childhood and into middle age. There is also the risk that common negative stereotypes about ageing distract from exploring the potential for developmental gains in later life such as those seen in the non-autistic population and some other conditions. The research presented here is part of a broader body of work aimed at addressing these gaps. To do this we explored older autistic adults’ experiences of social and emotional changes over the lifespan and their concerns for the future.\nMethods\nIn semi-structured one-on-one interviews we explored changes in social and emotional functioning over the lifespan and into later life and concerns for the future from the perspectives of six male and four female older autistic adults (Mage = 63.30 years; age range 53-74 years). Using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA), we conducted an iterative process of analysis and interpretation to identify and organise patterns and connections in the data into representative themes. \nResults\nParticipant interviews revealed a bittersweet but nonetheless positive outlook on life. Sub-themes of independence and autonomy, awareness and acceptance, positive reframing, family focus and humour supported an overarching theme of poignancy and positivity.\nConclusions\nParticipants’ positive outlook on life suggests the potential for developmental gains in autistic later life that parallel similar patterns in the general population. In the context of evidence from gerontological studies of social and emotional ageing, this work challenges existing negative expectations and stereotypes about old age and suggests opportunities to reframe future autism research and clinical practice to promote successful and healthy autistic ageing.",

          "abstract": "While death is a universal experience, how bereaved family members express and cope with the grief that follows varies across cultures. In East Asian cultures death is heavily tied to rigorous cultural practices and rituals, and so are grieving processes. This scoping review is the first to explore the potential impact of grief rituals for bereaved people from East Asia. A systematic review of existing literature was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of A reference was selected if: a) the study was conducted in either an East Asian or Southeast Asian country, b) described post-funeral rituals, and c) addressed grief outcomes. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify common themes when carrying out death rituals. Ten studies were included for review. Quantitative findings revealed correlations between funeral satisfaction and physical health, as well as funeral satisfaction and decreased distress over time. Qualitative studies suggested the following themes: 1) death as taboo, 2) family support, 3) public display of grief, and 4) continuing bonds. Our scope review suggests rituals as a mechanism for recovery from the death of a family member. Mourning rituals do not just provide support at the time of death but also help them adjust over time. Mental health providers can consider addressing identified ritual themes when working with grieving clients of East Asian cultural backgrounds.",

This study will investigate if UAP sighting\ndistributions exhibit fractal scaling spatially and temporally. Using\nNational UFO Reporting Center data, we will calculate fractal\ndimensions and Hurst exponents, comparing these to aircraft flight\npatterns. Significant fractal patterns will support hypotheses of\nscale-invariant UAP behavior, while non-fractal results will suggest\nconventional explanations, advancing empirical UAP analysis.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nUnidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) have gained scientific traction\nthrough declassified footage and civilian reports spanning decades,\nrevealing behaviors like rapid scale shifts and object splitting [1].\nThese patterns, documented in sources like the National UFO Reporting\nCenter (NUFORC), suggest potential fractal properties—self-similar\nstructures observed in systems from galaxy distributions to biological\nnetworks [2]. Fractal analysis offers a rigorous, empirical approach\nto study UAP without assuming their nature, addressing a gap in\nquantitative assessments of such phenomena.\n\nThis research will test whether UAP sightings exhibit fractal scaling,\nmotivated by eyewitness accounts of geometric objects splitting (e.g.,\nfrom 1 to 12 units) and mathematical patterns like iterative scaling\n(0.3333333333, ÷10, ×9), hinting at multi-scale dynamics [3].\nTheoretical constructs, such as string theory’s 11 dimensions or\nspeculative infinite-dimensional frameworks, inspire this inquiry,\nthough they remain untestable here [4]. We will focus on two research\nquestions: do UAP spatial distributions show fractal clustering, and\ndo their temporal patterns display long-range dependence? Hypotheses\nare:\n\nHypothesis 1: UAP sighting locations will yield a fractal dimension D\n&lt; 2, unlike uniform distributions (H0: D = 2).\n\nHypothesis 2: UAP sighting times will show a Hurst exponent H &gt; 0.5,\nindicating persistence (H0: H = 0.5).\n\nThese predictions, detailed in Table 1, will be tested using NUFORC\ndata against aircraft controls. Significant fractal metrics will\nsuggest non-random, scale-invariant patterns; non-significant results\nwill align UAP with conventional phenomena. Bayesian methods will\nensure robust interpretation of all outcomes, avoiding over-reliance\non null hypothesis significance testing (NHST).\n\n\n\nMethods\n\nWe will extract UAP sighting data from NUFORC and aircraft flight\nrecords from the FAA. Spatial analysis will use the box-counting\nmethod, overlaying grids (1 km to 1,000 km) to estimate D via N(δ) ∝\nδ^(-D). Temporal analysis will apply DFA to daily sighting counts,\ncalculating H over scales of 10 to 1,000 days. Positive controls will\ninclude random point distributions (D ≈ 2, H ≈ 0.5). Data collection\nand analysis will not be performed blindly to the conditions of the\nexperiments.\n\n\n\nEthics Information\n\nThis study will use anonymized, publicly available data, requiring no\nethical approvals or participant consent.\n\n\n\nPilot Data\n\nA preliminary analysis of 5,000 NUFORC sightings (2010–2020) will\nyield D ≈ 1.7 and H ≈ 0.65, differing from random baselines (D = 2, H\n= 0.5). Full details will be in Supplementary Information.\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nThe study will employ comparative observational design, analyzing UAP\nand aircraft data for fractal properties (Table 1).\n\n\n\nSampling Plan\n\nWe will sample ≥1,000 UAP sightings post-2000 with valid coordinates\nand timestamps, excluding duplicates. Aircraft data will match this\nsize. Power analysis, based on pilot r = 0.3, ensures 95% power at α =\n0.05 with N = 1,000.\n\n\n\nAnalysis Plan\n\nSpatial D and temporal H will be computed for UAP and aircraft data.\nDifferences will be tested using Bayesian inference (Bayes Factor &gt; 10\nfor H1 or H0). Preprocessing will normalize spatial data by population\ndensity. Contingencies: if data are non-normal, we will use robust\nBayesian models.\n\n\n\nData Availability\n\nRaw data will be shared on OSF upon Stage 2 acceptance, with pilot\ndata available now under embargo.\n\n\n\nCode Availability\n\nPython/R scripts will be shared on OSF upon Stage 2 acceptance, with\npilot analysis code available now under embargo.\n\n\n\nAdditional Information\n\nCompeting Interests: The author declares no competing interests.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] National UFO Reporting Center.

Understanding the predictors of afterlife beliefs is crucial for gaining insight into religious tenets and their broader impacts on individuals and societies. This retrospective longitudinal study used the first wave of nationally representative data from the Global Flourishing Study, covering 22 countries (N = 202,898), to examine 13 potential childhood predictors of afterlife belief in adulthood. We applied modified Poisson regression to analyze how these predictors influenced afterlife belief. Random-effects meta-analyses aggregated results for the 11 common predictors across all countries. Our results indicated that religious service attendance at age 12 was the most consistent predictor of afterlife belief in adulthood. Negative early experiences—such as childhood abuse and feelings of being an outsider—along with a strong maternal relationship, were linked to higher levels of afterlife belief. Additionally, female gender were associated with an increased likelihood of afterlife belief. This study is the first to use multinational data to provide evidence that a combination of childhood factors are related to afterlife beliefs in adulthood.",

While several national surveys highlight differences in afterlife beliefs across countries, none have explored the sociodemographic factors associated with these beliefs. Using data from Wave 1 of the Global Flourishing Study (N=202,898), weighted to be nationally representative, we estimated the proportion of people affirming belief in an afterlife in 22 countries. Primary analyses with demographic variables were conducted separately by country and then pooled using meta-analytic techniques. We examined variations in afterlife belief across nine sociodemographic characteristics: age, gender, marital status, employment status, education level, immigration status, frequency of religious service attendance, religious affiliation, and racial/ethnic identity. The overall proportion of the populations believing in life after death ranged from 95% in Indonesia to 21% in Japan. Meta-analytic results indicated cross-national heterogeneity across all sociodemographic categories, though the degree of variation differed. Random effects meta-analytic results highlighted religious service attendance as a key factor, with the highest belief in the afterlife observed among those attending services at least once per week. These findings provide a foundation for understanding population-level beliefs in the afterlife and continued exploration of their complexity across different contexts.",

          "abstract": "Background: Food cravings and binge eating behaviors are critical components of eating disorders, contributing to maladaptive eating patterns, weight gain, and psychological distress. Despite the growing recognition of their importance, there is a lack of culturally adapted assessment tools to evaluate these phenomena in Brazil.\nAims: This study aimed to perform the cross-cultural adaptation and validation of two key instruments—the Craving Experience Questionnaire (CEQ) and the Functions of Binge Eating Scale (FBES)—for use in the Brazilian population, ensuring semantic, content, and cultural relevance.\nMethods: The process included translation, synthesis, back-translation, expert committee review, and pre-testing. Content validity was assessed using the Content Validity Index (CVI) and inter-rater agreement via the Finn Coefficient. A panel of six experts in psychology, psychiatry, and nutrition evaluated the semantic equivalence, content alignment, and item relevance.\nResults: The CEQ demonstrated excellent validity in terms of semantics, content, and relevance. There was perfect agreement among raters for content and relevance. The FBES showed strong validity for content and relevance, with slightly lower validity for semantic equivalence. Minor revisions were made to enhance clarity and cultural appropriateness.\nDiscussion: The adaptation process confirmed the instruments' conceptual integrity and cultural fit. The CEQ effectively assesses craving intensity, imagery, and intrusiveness, while the FBES captures eight motives underlying binge eating, such as emotion regulation and self-punishment.\nConclusion: The Brazilian versions are reliable instruments for assessing food cravings and binge eating motives. Their integration into clinical and research settings will enhance specificity within established diagnostic categories, increasing the accuracy of binge eating disorder treatments by considering the integration of various areas of care. In this way, interventions will achieve more specific outcomes beyond the mere remission of binge eating episodes.",

However, cognitive decline occurs gradually and recent findings suggest that subtle alterations in autobiographical cognition may be evident earlier in the trajectory towards dementia, before AD-related symptoms emerge or a clinical diagnosis has been given. The current study used the Autobiographical Interview to examine the episodic and semantic content of autobiographical past and future events generated by older adults (N=38) of varying cognitive functioning who were grouped into High (N=20) and Low Cognition (N=18) groups based on their Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. Participants described 12 past and 12 future autobiographical events, and transcripts were scored to quantify the numbers of internal (episodic) or external (non-episodic, including semantic) details. Although the Low Cognition group exhibited a differential reduction for internal details comprising both past and future events, they did not show the expected overproduction of external details relative to the High Cognition group. Multilevel modelling demonstrated that on trials lower in episodic content, semantic content was significantly increased in both groups. Although suggestive of a compensatory mechanism, the magnitude of this inverse relationship did not differ across groups or interact with MoCA scores. This finding indicates that external detail production may be underpinned by mechanisms not affected by cognitive decline, such as narrative style and the ability to contextualize one’s past and future events in relation to broader autobiographical knowledge.",

In this study, we aim to determine whether the coupling between structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) is linked to symptoms trajectories in a longitudinal sample of individuals diagnosed with ADHD in childhood and followed into adulthood. Specifically, we will test whether differences in SC-FC coupling within a network of neural regions centered on two specific white matter tracts (the cingulum angular bundle and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus), previously found to be altered in adults with ADHD histories, are associated with the persistence or remission of ADHD symptoms. We will also examine how to SC-FC coupling in these neural pathways relate to developmental trajectories of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms from childhood. By focusing on the interplay between SC and FC, we aim to uncover neural signatures that differentiate adults with persistent ADHD symptoms from those whose symptoms have remitted. Findings could provide new insights into the neurodevelopmental processes underlying ADHD and may help identify neural markers predictive of symptom persistence as well as inform targeted interventions contributing to more personalized treatment strategies for individuals with ADHD across the lifespan.",

Although previous studies identified experimental conditions under which humans and non-human animals show increased variable decision-making, we have only a limited understanding of its underlying cognitive mechanisms. Using a reinforcement learning model, we simulate the use of three different theorized strategies in an adversarial reward learning environment that requires very high variability. Model simulations with a policy-gradient meta-learning algorithm show that agents could respond more optimally in such environments by (1) relying on a stochastic generator, (2) increasing one’s learning rate to allow for faster interactions between reinforcement learning and extinction, or (3) strategically upvalue unchosen actions using a frequency-based memory. After demonstrating the theoretical benefit of each of these strategies, we fitted our model on existing datasets of human-, pigeons- and rat behavior in adversarial environments. We show that, while all three species can engage in highly variable behavior, only humans strategically upvalue unchosen actions as a strategy to achieve variability.",

          "abstract": "Animal research has shown that repeatedly performing a rewarded action leads to its transition into a habit—an inflexible response controlled by stimulus-response associations. Efforts to reproduce this principle in human populations have yielded mixed results.  Only two laboratory paradigms have successfully demonstrated behavior habitualization following extensive instrumental training compared to minimal training conditions: the forced-response task and the ‘aliens’ outcome-devaluation task. Notably, these paradigms measure behavior habitualization through distinct measures. The forced-response task focuses on the persistence of a trained response when a reversal is required, whereas the outcome-devaluation task measures reaction time switch costs—slowdowns in goal-directed responses that conflict with the trained habit. Although both measures have produced results consistent with those expected from learning theory—showing stronger evidence of habits in overtrained conditions—their construct validity remains insufficiently established. In this study, participants completed four days of training in each paradigm. We then examined the reliability of each measure and evaluated their convergent validity. Habitual responses in the forced-response task and reaction time switch costs in the outcome-devaluation task demonstrated good reliability, allowing us to assess whether individual differences remained stable across measures.  However, the two measures were not associated, providing no evidence of convergent validity. This finding suggests that these measures capture distinct aspects of the balance between habitual and goal-directed control. Our results highlight the need for further evaluation of the validity and reliability of current measures used to investigate habit control in humans.",

One manifestation of this is the rich pattern of semantic similarity effects found in immediate serial recall tasks. These effects differ from the effects of similarity on other dimensions (e.g., phonological similarity), which renders them difficult to explain. We propose a comprehensive mechanistic explanation of semantic similarity effects by extending a standard connectionist architecture for modeling immediate serial recall to incorporate semantic representations. Central to our proposal is the selective encoding of categorical features shared among multiple list-items. The selective encoding of shared semantic features is made possible via a tagging mechanism that enables the model to encode shared feature retrospectively. Through this category-encoding mechanism, our model accounts for the majority of semantic similarity effects. Our results imply that working memory represents semantic information in a more restricted way than phonological information.",

This paper employs a correlation-based network construction method to investigate the colexification networks of the two concepts in 58 + 68 Tibeto-Burman languages. A total of 104 concepts colexified with ‘fruit’ and 99 concepts colexified with ‘stone’ are organized into macro semantic classes. Semantic networks on the basis of the similarities in colexification patterns of concepts, as well as languages networks on the basis of the similarities in colexification patterns of languages, are constructed for ‘fruit’ and ‘stone’, respectively. The results indicate that classifiers for small round objects evolved from either ‘fruit’ or ‘stone’ are directly colexified with class terms in compound nouns denoting varieties of fruits/stones and the shape class of small round objects, indicating that they are diachronically related. However, ‘fruit’ and ‘stone’ differ significantly in their modes of deriving a classifier. Moreover, languages that have developed classifiers from ‘fruit’ are mostly from the Ngwi subgroup, whereas languages whose classifiers are colexified with ‘stone’ evolved independently.",

However, the emergence of machine learning (ML) algorithms has opened new opportunities for exploring variable relationships beyond linear constraints. To interpret the outcomes of these \"black-box\" algorithms, various tools for assessing feature importance have been developed. However, most of these tools are descriptive and do not facilitate statistical inference. To address this gap, our study introduces two versions of residual permutation tests (RPTs), designed to assess the significance of a target feature in predicting the label. The first variant, RPT on Y (RPT-Y ), permutes\nthe residuals of the label conditioned on features other than the target. The second variant, RPT on X (RPT-X), permutes the residuals of the target feature conditioned on the other features. Our simulation study demonstrates that RPT-X eﬀectively maintains empirical Type I error rates within acceptable bounds and exhibits appreciable power in both regression and classification tasks. These findings suggest the utility of RPT-X for hypothesis testing in ML applications.",

In Floatation-REST, an individual lies on the surface of highly saline water in a dark and silent environment, which typically leads to profound physical and mental relaxation. Prior research on Floatation-REST highlighted its benefits for both physical and mental health in otherwise healthy individuals as well as anxiolytic and antidepressant effects in people with a spectrum of anxiety and stress-related disorders.\nMethods: To delineate the float experience, a qualitative-empirical approach was employed engaging ten healthy participants, each of whom completed a 60-minute float session followed by a focused interview on the perception of silence, darkness, and gravity. The data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis and MAXQDA software.\nResults: Silence was largely perceived as pleasant, evoking feelings of security, relaxation, and trust. Silence heightened sensitivity to auditory stimuli and deepened awareness of thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations. Darkness, although generally experienced as less pleasant than silence, similarly facilitated enhanced introspection and mental-process awareness. Regarding gravity, sensations of weightlessness and the dissolution of body boundaries were associated with mental relaxation, security, and a feeling of lightness. \nConclusions: Floatation-REST is being employed in studies to induce altered states of consciousness (ASC), as well as in therapeutic contexts to treat mental disorders. Similar to our study, future work could selectively focus on exploring the impact of the three major aspects of the floatation experience we assessed on ASC and therapeutic success.",

We conducted a conjoint experiment (N = 1,500) to test Indians’ support for the 2070 goal depending on differences among possible policy features including economic programs, allocation of funds collected via coal taxes, policies to mitigate pollution, who participates in the policy-making process, and adaptation policy. We find that Indians express stronger support for the 2070 goal when it includes jobs programs for Indians who lose their job in a coal-fired power plant, policies to mitigate pollution, investment or redistribution of funds collected via coal taxes, and adaptation policies to protect the most vulnerable Indians and critical infrastructure.

          "abstract": "In experimental psychology and behavioral neuroscience, habits are considered stimulus-response (S-R) associations formed through extended reward training. Accordingly, habits are assessed using one of two tests: 1) Outcome devaluation, in which the value of the outcome (reward) is reduced, making it less desirable, and 2) Contingency degradation, in which the response-outcome association is reversed so that responding prevents the delivery of a reward. If a behavior is controlled by S-R links, then it should remain unaffected by these two manipulations. Animal research using the outcome devaluation test has shown that initially goal-directed actions can become habitual after extended operant training. However, replicating this transition in human research has proven challenging, representing a significant problem for translational research. Notably, the contingency degradation test has rarely been used in human research. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate a shift from goal-directed to habitual control through three pre-registered experiments. Participants were trained in two S-R-O (stimulus-response-outcome) mappings for three days, with one condition (the ‘overtrained’) occurring four times more frequently than the other ('standard’). Importantly, we assessed the habitualization of both responses by using a degraded contingency test. Overall, we found no evidence of an overtraining effect — that is, the ‘overtrained’ condition did not lead to increased habitual responding. We discuss the theoretical and applied implications of these findings and explore further directions for studying habitual behavior.",

          "abstract": "The current study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of eight executive function (EF) tasks designed for use in infancy and early childhood. Modern measurement theory and item response theory (IRT) frameworks were applied to examine the underlying latent ability influencing children’s performance on EF tasks. Longitudinal assessments at 8 months, 2.5 years, and 5 years were conducted as part of the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study, and 830 participants from the larger cohort were included in the present study. The results indicated that the tasks included in the study were effective in measuring children’s EF abilities with a certain level of discrimination power. The difficulty level of each task varied across time points. In 8-month-old children, the A-not-B task scores were the most informative for assessing above-average levels of EF ability. At 2.5 years of age, the two EF tasks (Spin the Pots and Snack Delay) provided the most informative assessments for children with low to moderate levels of EF ability. Among 5-year-old children, three EF tasks measured ability levels only below the sample mean, whereas two additional tasks captured a broader range of EF abilities. The discussion highlights the benefits of applying IRT analysis to EF measurements and emphasises the need for reliable and scalable tools to assess how executive function changes among individuals during early childhood.",

          "abstract": "Empathy allows us to infer the affective state of another individual and resonate with it. Accumulating evidence suggests that on a neural level, empathizing relies on ‘shared neural representations’, i.e., patterns of neural activation recruited both during the first-hand and the empathic experience of a specific affective state. Studies employing placebo analgesia have shown consistent reductions in behavioral ratings and neural activity for both first-hand and empathic pain. The mechanistic interpretation of such effects, however, remains elusive, as placebo analgesia could exert its effects on empathy either via pharmacological actions or via top-down cognitive processes on pain and empathy beliefs. To address this limitation, we conducted a double-blind, within-subjects study administering either an opioid antagonist (naltrexone) or an inactive placebo in two separate testing sessions (N=35 healthy, neurotypical individuals, 21 female), and participants experienced both pain first-hand and pain empathy. We predicted that naltrexone would similarly increase first-hand pain and empathy for pain. The results, however, show reduced ratings of first-hand pain and empathy for pain, and thus, unexpectedly, hypo- rather than hyperalgesic effects. However, the coherence in their directionality confirms the hypothesis of shared opioidergic mechanisms being involved in the first-hand experience of pain and empathy for pain.",

          "authors": "Pablo Martínez-López; Antonio Vázquez-Millán; Francisco Garre-Frutos; David Luque",
          "abstract": "Animal research has shown that repeatedly performing a rewarded action leads to its transition into a habit—an inflexible response controlled by stimulus-response associations. Efforts to reproduce this principle in human populations have yielded mixed results.  Only two laboratory paradigms have successfully demonstrated behavior habitualization following extensive instrumental training compared to minimal training conditions: the forced-response task and the ‘aliens’ outcome-devaluation task. Notably, these paradigms measure behavior habitualization through distinct measures. The forced-response task focuses on the persistence of a trained response when a reversal is required, whereas the outcome-devaluation task measures reaction time switch costs—slowdowns in goal-directed responses that conflict with the trained habit. Although both measures have produced results consistent with those expected from learning theory—showing stronger evidence of habits in overtrained conditions—their construct validity remains insufficiently established. In this study, participants completed four days of training in each paradigm. We then examined the reliability of each measure and evaluated their convergent validity. Habitual responses in the forced-response task and reaction time switch costs in the outcome-devaluation task demonstrated good reliability, allowing us to assess whether individual differences remained stable across measures.  However, the two measures were not associated, providing no evidence of convergent validity. This finding suggests that these measures capture distinct aspects of the balance between habitual and goal-directed control. Our results highlight the need for further evaluation of the validity and reliability of current measures used to investigate habit control in humans.",

          "abstract": "Habitual behaviour is commonly assumed to operate outside of conscious awareness, driven by stimulus-response (S-R) associations rather than goal-directed evaluation. However, whether habitual instrumental behaviours can be triggered by stimuli that are not consciously perceived remains an understudied question. In a preregistered within-subjects study (N after exclusions = 75), we examined this question by employing a symmetrical outcome revaluation task. Participants underwent extensive instrumental training, forming strong S-R associations, before completing two testing stages: a conscious stage with fully visible stimuli and an unconscious stage where stimuli were rendered subliminal via visual masking. In the conscious condition, participants exhibited habitual control, responding more accurately to habit-congruent (still-valuable, still-non-valuable) stimuli than to habit-incongruent (upvalued, devalued) stimuli, replicating prior findings. However, in the unconscious condition participants did not exhibit above-chance accuracy, and responses were not biased toward habitual actions, suggesting that subliminal stimuli were unable to elicit either habitual or goal-directed responses. These findings challenge the notion that habitual control of instrumental behaviour can function independently of stimulus awareness and suggest that conscious access to action-relevant cues may be necessary even for well-established S-R associations to guide behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition involving widespread pain, fatigue, and cognitive impairment. Evidence-based interventions for fibromyalgia, such as education and exercise, often require prolonged, cognitive and/or physical effort, involving immediate costs (effort) for delayed benefits (improved pain/function). Initiation of, and adherence to, these interventions is often difficult. While assumed to reflect low motivation, these difficulties may reflect pain-related alterations in an individual’s attitudes towards effortful and delayed rewards. Here we explored whether individuals with fibromyalgia differed from age- and sex-matched pain-free controls in such attitudes. In Study 1, individuals with fibromyalgia (N=19) and controls (N=19) completed tasks offering real rewards (raffle tickets) for performing actual physical or cognitive effort or enduring real delays. Despite individualising task difficulty to each participant’s unique capacity, those with fibromyalgia required higher incentives to engage in the physical effort task (treadmill walking), especially at higher effort intensities, but showed no differences in the cognitive effort task, indicating no general motivation deficit but rather a shift in attitudes toward physical exertion. Additionally, participants with fibromyalgia showed a greater willingness to wait for rewards, particularly at lower reward levels, suggesting an increased motivation driven by rewards. Study 2, conducted online (N=43 fibromyalgia, N=139 controls), replicated these findings, reinforcing that fibromyalgia does not involve a broad motivational deficit based on reward magnitude. Instead, we found specific changes in physical effort discounting and indications of heightened sensitivity to rewards in delay discounting. These insights may help inform tailored intervention strategies for individuals with fibromyalgia.",

          "abstract": "Engraved ochres and ostrich eggshells from the South African Blombos Cave and Diepkloof Rock Shelter are among the earliest expressions of human symbolic behaviour. They appear to document a continuous practice of non-figurative mark-making across ~40.000 years. During this time, the engraved markings change from simpler unstructured patterns to more complex, ordered and symmetric markings such as cross-hatchings. To inform discussions of the possible function of the engravings, we conducted a two-part experimental study. Based on the assumption that artifact use will motivate incremental adaptive refinements, we used a transmission chain experiment to reconstruct the cultural evolutionary trajectory of the engraved marking. Each transmission chain was seeded with drawings derived from the early Blombos and Diepkloof engravings. We then conducted five experiments to assess the cognitive implications of the changes to the drawings and compared these results to a similar analysis of the original engravings. The drawings became increasingly easier to discriminate and increased in their perceived intentionality over the experimental generations. There was no evidence of a systematic change in drawing saliency or memorability, and the drawings did not acquire stylistic properties over the experimental generations. Although we observe interesting qualitative similarities between the original engravings and the transmission chain drawings, our findings suggest that cognitive biases and working memory constraints are not sufficient to generate the patterns observed in the archaeological record, highlight the significance of social and functional contexts in shaping early symbolic artifacts. By integrating archaeological and experimental research we can better inform inferences on sparse records of early symbolic behaviour. Our study thus leads to a broader consideration of the role, strengths and potential limitations of the transmission chain approach in analysing trajectories of early symbolic behaviour.",

However, existing methods for meta-regression have limitations, such as inadequate consideration of model uncertainty and poor performance under publication bias. To overcome these limitations, we extend robust\nBayesian meta-analysis (RoBMA) to meta-regression (RoBMA-regression). RoBMA-regression allows for moderator analyses while simultaneously taking into account the uncertainty about the presence and impact of other factors (i.e., the main effect, heterogeneity, publication bias, and other potential moderators). The methodology presents a coherent way of assessing the evidence for and against the presence of both continuous and categorical moderators. We further employ a Savage-Dickey density ratio test to quantify the evidence for and against the presence of the effect at different levels of categorical moderators. We illustrate RoBMA-regression in an empirical example and demonstrate its performance in a simulation study. We implemented the methodology in the RoBMA R package. Overall, RoBMA-regression presents researchers with a powerful and flexible tool for conducting robust and informative meta-regression analyses.",

          "abstract": "Background. The experience sampling method (ESM), also known as ecological momentary assessment, is gaining popularity in physical activity research. This method involves assessing participants’ behaviors and experiences repeatedly over time. One key advantage of ESM is its ability to temporally separate the dependent and independent variable of interest, reducing the risk of reverse causality. However, temporal separation alone is insufficient for establishing causality. This methodology paper illustrates the importance of the identification phase in drawing causal conclusions from ESM data. In the identification phase the causal effect of interest (or estimand) is specified and the assumptions under which a statistical association can be considered as causal are visualized using causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Methods. We demonstrate how to define a causal estimand and construct a DAG for a specific ESM research question. The example focuses on the causal effect of physical activity performed in real-life on subsequent executive functioning among older adults. The DAG development process combines literature review and expert consultations to identify time-varying and time-invariant confounders. Results. The developed DAG shows multiple backdoor paths creating confounding bias, even with temporal separation of the exposure (physical activity) and outcome (executive functioning). Two approaches to address this confounding bias are illustrated: (1) physical control using the within-person encouragement design, where participants receive randomized prompts to perform physical activity in their natural environment, and (2) analytic control, involving assessing all confounding variables and adjusting for these variables in the analysis phase. Conclusions. Implementing the identification phase enables ESM researchers to make more informed decisions, thereby enhancing the validity of causal inferences in studies aimed at answering causal questions.",

          "abstract": "In experimental psychology and behavioral neuroscience, habits are considered stimulus-response (S-R) associations formed through extended reward training. Accordingly, habits are assessed using one of two tests: 1) Outcome devaluation, in which the value of the outcome (reward) is reduced, making it less desirable, and 2) Contingency degradation, in which the response-outcome association is reversed so that responding prevents the delivery of a reward. If a behavior is controlled by S-R links, then it should remain unaffected by these two manipulations. Animal research using the outcome devaluation test has shown that initially goal-directed actions can become habitual after extended operant training. However, replicating this transition in human research has proven challenging, representing a significant problem for translational research. Notably, the contingency degradation test has rarely been used in human research. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate a shift from goal-directed to habitual control through three pre-registered experiments. Participants were trained in two S-R-O (stimulus-response-outcome) mappings for three days, with one condition (the ‘overtrained’) occurring four times more frequently than the other ('standard’). Importantly, we assessed the habitualization of both responses by using a degraded contingency test. Overall, we found no evidence of an overtraining effect — that is, the ‘overtrained’ condition did not lead to increased habitual responding. We discuss the theoretical and applied implications of these findings and explore further directions for studying habitual behavior.",

          "abstract": "The present work investigated changes in well-being from shortly before graduating from upper secondary education to approximately one year later. The motivation for a post-school pathway and perceptions of the impact of moving out of home, ending a relationship, and entering a new relationship were examined as potential predictors of between-person differences in well-being trajectories. German-speaking high school graduates (N = 897) reported on their affective well-being in up to four surveys over approximately one year and indicated their motivation for their post-school pathway and life events they had experienced. At three measurement occasions, participants also participated in a three-week experience sampling phase, in which they reported on their daily well-being. Latent change models revealed an initial increase in well-being after graduation, but mixed evidence for subsequent trajectories, as both positive and negative affect decreased on average. Changes in well-being were more pronounced for global assessments of affective well-being. We did not find associations of the motivation for a post-school pathway and the life events with well-being trajectories. Overall, these findings highlight the complexity of well-being trajectories during the transition out of upper secondary education and the importance of using multiple time points and assessment methods to understand these dynamics.",

In support of our first hypothesis, we found an overall negative relationship between reflective thinking and BiG; and in support of our second hypothesis, we found an overall positive relationship between intuitive thinking and BiG. Contrary to our third hypothesis, we found no evidence that completing the CRT before eliciting BiG influenced BiG scores by priming reflective thinking. Given that this is the first large cross-cultural test of these hypotheses to have a preregistered analysis plan, to hold education constant across countries, and to use both Bayesian and frequentist methods, these results considerably bolster the evidence in support of the first two hypotheses and against the third hypothesis.",

          "authors": "Philip Gerrans; Hugh MGovern; Jakob Hohwy; Lena K L Oestreich",
          "abstract": "Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD) is a newly recognized diagnosis that is distinguished from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) through additional symptom clusters beyond re-experiencing, avoidance, and a persistent sense of threat. In addition to these core PTSD symptoms, C-PTSD is characterized by disturbances in self-organization, including affective dysregulation, negative self-concept, and interpersonal difficulties. These disruptions often result in persistent emotional instability, deep-seated feelings of worthlessness or guilt, and challenges in forming and maintaining relationships. While PTSD often arises from discrete traumatic events, C-PTSD is more commonly associated with prolonged or repeated interpersonal trauma, such as childhood maltreatment, domestic violence, or prolonged captivity. Here, we propose a novel model that explains these differences, identifies their neural substrates, and outlines the potential role of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in C-PTSD treatment. Drawing on active inference theories of cognition, we apply the concept of self-modelling to elucidate the insula’s role in affective regulation and adaptation to adversity. This framework clarifies the insula’s involvement not only in C-PTSD but also in other conditions affecting self-awareness and emotional processing. By integrating insights from neuroscience and psychopharmacology, we discuss how MDMA-assisted therapy may recalibrate affective regulation and reinforce a more stable self-model, offering a promising avenue for treatment. Theoretical and clinical implications are explored, emphasizing the need for further empirical research into MDMA’s therapeutic potential for C-PTSD.",

          "abstract": "Parental rules have been curiously neglected from a conceptual and measurement perspective. The first half of this paper reviews the literature to show that there is no commonly used, standardized measure of rules. Rules are typically measured either with unvalidated ad hoc standalone items or incidentally measured with 1-2 items on multi-item scales assessing a broader parenting construct (e.g., discipline). Construct definitions are rarely stated, often circular, and inconsistent between authors. As a result, the empirical literature on parental rules is difficult to appraise and synthesize. The second half of this paper proposes a new framework for conceptualizing parental rules that includes an explicit, non-circular construct definition and delineates 7 dimensions along which a parental rule can vary. The framework is designed to be universally applicable across youth behaviors and scientific fields and enable a more rigorous science of parental rules.",

          "abstract": "Despite increased public interest and research on intensive high-dose mental health interventions, much remains unknown about the mental health effects and safety of multi-day intensive high-dose mindfulness meditation training. Accordingly, we aimed to study its salutary and adverse effects on mental health. We conducted a preregistered prospective intervention study among 89 adults who registered for 6-day insight mindfulness meditation retreats and 46 matched controls (Mage(SDage) = 33.75(9.50), 56.3% female). Controls were selected from a pool of 543 people recruited from the same community of meditators as retreat participants and matched to retreat participants on age and lifetime meditation experience. Retreat participants demonstrated significant improvements in well-being, negative affect, perseverative thinking, brooding rumination, and depression symptoms at 2-week follow-up compared to matched controls (η² range = .04–.08, ps &lt; .05). Importantly, the % of participants exhibiting statistically reliable deterioration in mental health outcomes at 2-week follow-up were equal or lower among retreat participants than among matched controls in the entire sample, as well as in a sub-sample with clinically elevated depression and/or anxiety (ORs &lt; 1). These findings suggest that a 6-day mindfulness meditation retreat can produce rapid improvements in mental health, comparable to effect sizes of much longer 8-week mindfulness-based programs. These findings also challenge concerns about adverse effects of intensive high-dose meditation training and suggest that it may be a safe and effective intervention modality, even for clinically vulnerable adults struggling with depression or anxiety.",

In contrast, for addition they are taught to decompose the smaller digit to make 10 (e.g., 8 + 6 = 8 + 2 + 4). We hypothesized that these learning experiences would be reflected in the preferred order of operands, that is, min-first for multiplication and max-first for addition.

          "abstract": "This study investigates the clinical utility of rhythmic digital markers (RDMs) in schizophrenia. RDMs are digital markers capturing behavioral rhythms over different timescales - within 24 hours span (ultradian), at a span of 24 hours (circadian), or over cycles of more than 24 hours (infradian). While previous research has explored digital markers for schizophrenia, the focus has primarily been on sensor data variability rather than rhythmic patterns. This study introduces two RDMs: an entropy RDM, which quantifies uncertainty in activity distribution over the infradian cycles, and a dynamic RDM, which is derived from models of transitions in entropy and psychotic symptom intensity using Markov chain analysis. Data were ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) of 39 activities collected from 390 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and controls. We assessed associations between RDMs and symptom severity and whether participants could be differentiated based on these RDMs. We found that participants with schizophrenia significantly differed on dynamic RDMs, suggesting a potential diagnostic utility. However, dynamic RDMs were not associated with symptom severity, and entropy RDM had no significant clinical correlate. Our findings contribute to the growing evidence on digital markers in psychiatry and highlight the potential of rhythmic digital markers (RDMs) in characterizing digital phenotypes for schizophrenia.",

This study investigates how weight loss method—Ozempic, diet/exercise, or a combination of both—impacts moral judgments and perceptions of effort, praiseworthiness, and identity/value change. We used a contrastive vignette technique in two experiments (combined N = 1041, nationally representative for age, sex, and ethnicity) to study the attitudes of US participants toward a fictional character who lost 50 pounds through one of the three described methods. Weight loss through diet/exercise was deemed most effortful and most praiseworthy, whereas Ozempic use, even when combined with diet/exercise, was rated as both less effortful and less praiseworthy than diet/exercise alone. Ozempic use with no mention of diet/exercise was rated as least effortful and least praiseworthy. Compared to diet and exercise alone, Ozempic use also decreased perceptions that the individual had really changed as a person, or experienced a change in their underlying values. We discuss potential implications, address study limitations, and provide suggestions for further work.",

          "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that our perception of time is tied to the embodiment of space. In particular, they suggest that time intervals are perceived or reproduced differently for stimuli at different distances from our body, and that this interaction of space and time is altered when we interact with spatial distances using tools. To corroborate these findings, we performed a series of experiments in physical and virtual setups, testing 218 participants on a time reproduction task for stimuli presented at three distances from the body (60, 120 &amp; 240 cm). In between testing sessions participants performed tool-use training, whereby they either used physical or virtual tools to manipulate objects at distances between 120 and 200 cm from their body. Prior to training, the reproduced intervals were overall longer for stimuli at an intermediate distance (120cm) compared to near the body (60cm). Tool-use training significantly shortened the reproduced intervals for stimuli at 120 cm, hence the distance at which tool-use training was operated. Participants' sensitivity to the presented intervals did not differ between distances prior to training, but was significantly reduced by tool-use training systematically at all distances. We observed qualitatively similar results for experiments in physical and virtual setups. Yet, the effect sizes for individual experiments were small, pointing to systematic but weak effects. Overall, this supports previous claims that time perception is tied to space and our interaction with this, though further work is required to understand the robustness and specificity of these effects.  \n\nKeywords: Time perception, Peripersonal Space, Space Representation, Active Tool-use",

          "abstract": "Petitionary prayers—requests made to a deity for specific outcomes—are widely practiced across religious traditions. While their efficacy remains a subject of theological debate, they exhibit remarkable resilience to disconfirmation. In three pre-registered studies—a field study in China and two global surveys via Prolific (total n=1800)—we examined how religious believers (Christians, Muslims, local deity worshippers, and Hindus) update beliefs and behaviors in response to prayer successes or failures for both hypothetical co-religionists and themselves. Results indicate that belief updates generally follow a Bayesian pattern, with increases after prayer successes and decreases after failures, though with an asymmetry favoring belief reinforcement. Notably, participants from the Prolific sample exhibit sensitivity to the prior probability of prayed-for events, attributing greater belief increases to improbable outcomes. Muslims predict belief increases even after failed prayers, consistent with doctrines framing hardships as divine tests. Across traditions, believers estimate continued prayer regardless of past outcomes, with monotheists displaying stronger resilience. These findings illuminate the cognitive and cultural mechanisms that buffer religious beliefs against counter-evidence, contributing to debates on the evidential vulnerability of religious credence and its parallels with epistemically self-sealing belief systems.",

          "abstract": "Psychological researchers are interested in how things change over time and routinely make claims about age effects (e.g., personality maturation), cohort effects (e.g., generational differences in narcissism), and sometimes period effects (e.g., secular trends in mental health). The age-period-cohort identification problem means that these claims are not possible based on the data alone: Any possible temporal pattern can be explained by an infinite number of combinations of age, period, and cohort effects. This concern holds regardless of the study design (it also applies to longitudinal designs covering multiple cohorts) and the number of observations available (it also applies if we observe the whole population). Researchers usually rely on statistical models that impose constraints to pick one specific decomposition of effects. Unfortunately, these constraints often remain opaque, resulting in a lack of scrutiny of the underlying assumptions. How can we reason more transparently and systematically about age, period, and cohort? Here, I summarize advances in our understanding of the precise nature of the identification problem, provide an overview of ways to move forward, and highlight one approach that is particularly transparent about assumptions: bounding analysis, a framework developed by sociologists Ethan Fosse and Christopher Winship. To illustrate this approach, I analyze how age, period, and cohort affect attitudes toward working mothers in the German General Social Survey.",

A volume of evidence encompassing social, cognitive, and applied psychology has established Implementation Intentions as an effective strategy for goal pursuit over simply intending to pursue a goal (Goal Intentions). In this Perspective, we propose a computational framework for intention formation (Implementation vs. Goal vs. No Intention) and how it impacts goal pursuit. Our framework explains a broad range of findings within the intention formation literature including seemingly contradictory ones, while making novel empirically testable predictions. Importantly, it establishes normative conditions under which forming Implementation (vs. Goal) Intentions is an optimal strategy considering its benefits and costs. Finally, current formal models of value-based decision-making rarely consider ecological timescales of human intentions. Interfacing with this work, we lay the groundwork for a neurocognitive understanding of intention formation and its impact on goal pursuit.",

          "abstract": "Human brain, as the carrier of memory and consciousness, has become a hot topic in neuroscience research recently, the study of memory may be the hottest one. However, many questions remain unanswered, including how the information is stored and recalled; where the information is stored; how multiple engrams interact. In this article, I propose the model of long-term memory of human brain, as a hypothesis of architecture of memory in human brain. This model can answer the following questions: 1) What is architecture of long-term memory of human brain? 2) Where is the information of memory stored? 3) How is the new information integrated into the network of memory without influencing the old memory? It also can explain some questions about contextual fear conditioning (CFC) in mice, such as why engram cells can retain memory under retrograde amnesia. This model demonstrates the whole framework of neuronal network for long-term memory, and also can be used for computer modeling of neuronal network of long-term memory. This model is the foundation of brain-inspired AI.",

          "abstract": "Can active inference model consciousness? We offer three conditions implying that it can. The first condition is the simulation of a reality or generative world model, which determines what can be known or acted upon; namely an epistemic field. The second is inferential competition to enter the world model. Only the inferences that coherently reduce long-term uncertainty win, evincing a selection for consciousness that we call Bayesian binding. The third is epistemic depth, which is the recurrent sharing of the Bayesian beliefs throughout the system. Due to this recursive loop — in a hierarchical system (such as a brain) — the world model contains the knowledge that it exists. This is distinct from self-consciousness, because the world model knows itself non-locally and continuously evidences this knowing (i.e., field-evidencing). Formally, we propose a hyper-model for precision-control across the entire hierarchy, whose latent states (or parameters) encode and control the overall structure and weighting rules for all layers of inference. This Beautiful Loop Theory is deeply revealing about meditation, psychedelic, and altered states, minimal phenomenal experience, and provides a new vision for conscious artificial intelligence.",

          "abstract": "In the context of task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), cognitive modes can be defined as task-general cognitive/sensory/motor processes which reliably elicit specific blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal pattern configurations. A number of cognitive modes are detectable with task-based fMRI. Here we present Focus on Visual Features (FoVF), a cognitive mode that demonstrates both activation and deactivation depending on the task context. The BOLD signal configurations associated with FoVF are modulated by a range of tasks, and here, we present six. For each task, we report: (1) specific pattern-based (as opposed to coordinate-based) anatomical details essential for distinguishing FoVF from other BOLD-based cognitive modes, and (2) task-induced BOLD signal changes associated with FoVF over a range of task conditions. In order to facilitate recognition, we playfully nicknamed the anatomical patterns specific to the FoVF cognitive mode as follows: (1) Stay Puff and (2) Old Blue Eyes. Evidence for the FoVF cognitive mode was derived from the timing and magnitude of task-induced BOLD signal changes elicited by the following types of tasks: working memory (verbal and spatial), thought generation, evidence integration, task switching, and handedness. This evidence consistently supported the FoVF cognitive mode as involving activation when there is focus on the features of the visual display to enhance task performance, and deactivation when features of the visual display are irrelevant to the task, or when attending to the features may detract from task performance.",

          "abstract": "Financial exploitation of older adults has become an increasingly urgent public health issue, with annual losses exceeding $10 billion in the US annually. This exploitation often stems from age-related cognitive deficits, such as impairments in working memory and cognitive flexibility, which are linked to deterioration of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). A critical yet understudied component of age-related cognitive decline is confirmation bias—the tendency to interpret new information in a way that conforms to one’s pre-existing beliefs. As older adults focus more on present-oriented goals related to social and emotional satisfaction, their ability to recognize and respond to exploitative situations may decrease. This problem worsens with the progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders, increasing vulnerability to fraud. Despite these links, little is known about how confirmation bias is associated with future cognitive decline and risk for fraud. Two main challenges impede progress: the lack of knowledge about the latent processes that shape confirmation bias in this population, and the reliance on correlations between brain responses and behavior that do not clarify causal mechanisms. To address these issues, this chapter provides an overview of confirmation bias and its connection to aging. It then addresses adverse effects of confirmation bias before highlighting strengths of noninvasive brain stimulation as a method of investigating these relationships further.",

The current study investigates the temporal course of joy, as reported on daily diary cards, in adults with BPD receiving a 6-month course of comprehensive DBT (N=95). BPD severity was measured every four weeks. Results showed that joy increased significantly during treatment, whereas negative affect decreased. Semi-parametric time-varying effect models showed that increases in joy were steeper earlier in treatment and plateaued around month four of treatment. Additionally, within-person increases in joy during a given month predicted decreases in BPD severity at the end of that month. Our results suggest that PA may be an important treatment target deserving of further clinical attention in in DBT, given that it prospectively predicts reductions in BPD symptom severity. Our finding that joy increases during DBT, particularly in early stages of treatment, may be an important incentive to bolster treatment uptake and commitment.",

          "abstract": "The population correlation coefficients are the indices of the correlational strength of two variables, X and Y. However, when asked what it means, people often suggest that a positive correlation means a higher value on variable X is coupled with a higher value on variable Y. Then, they implicitly and even explicitly expect that if sample A is higher on variable X than sample B, sample A's value on variable Y is also higher than that of sample B. But this inference is not always correct unless the correlation coefficient is one. The present study analyzed the triad relationship between the probability of such inferences' accuracy, the strength of the correlation, and the standardized distance between two X values of samples A and B. The conclusion is that such practice has very limited usefulness in realistic situations. The article proposes using a 95% range of variability of Y when one needs to expect the Y value based on the paired X value, or reporting the probability of dominance when comparing two samples is necessary.",

Multilevel analyses including participants with and without cLBP showed that greater momentary fear of movement, lower momentary pain self-efficacy, and higher momentary levels of leisure-time physical activity were associated with higher pain intensity (β=.05, p=.042, β=–.15, p&lt;.001, and β=.04, p=.001).

          "abstract": "This study explores the semantic depth of grammatical number in Ukrainian through a distributional semantic approach. In Ukrainian, the number category is considered a morphological category with a semantic dominance (Vykhovanecj, 2004). This view suggests that some forms are semantically motivated, while others express number only formally. By utilizing the semantically annotated General Regionally Annotated Corpus of Ukrainian (GRAC) and word embeddings from the TenTen Corpus for Ukrainian, this research analyzes the distributional representations of grammatical number to uncover its semantic nuances. The observed patterns in the usage of singular and plural forms in Ukrainian nouns align with the heterogenity of the number category. As such, the distribution of singular and plural forms does not strictly follow grammatical patterns. Instead, semantic factors play a significant role in determining the choice between singular and plural forms in Ukrainian nouns. In Ukrainian, a language with a rich morphological system, the semantics of grammatical number extends beyond simple quantification, touching on nuances of meaning, cultural usage, and syntactic dependencies.",

          "abstract": "Background\nOne of the most prominent theories of drug addiction is the incentive sensitization model. Individual differences in the tendency to ascribe motivational salience to cues that predict reward, and their ability to promote reward-seeking behaviour have been identified as potentially important in understanding vulnerability to addiction and relapse. However, to date this behaviour has not been assessed in a treatment-seeking clinical population, highlighting a significant gap in the literature pertaining to incentive sensitization and drug addiction.\n\nMethods\nIndividuals accessing drug and alcohol services with alcohol as primary drug of concern were recruited to participate in an intervention study. At the baseline session, participants completed various self-report measures (including the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test; AUDIT) in addition to a visual search task measuring sign-tracking to cues predicting monetary reward. Self-reported abstinence at 3-month follow up was primary outcome measure. All analyses and hypotheses were pre-registered.\n\nResults\nAt baseline (49 participants), AUDIT scores correlated with sign-tracking to signals of monetary reward, a relationship that cannot be explained by overall response time in the task or demographic variables. Sign-tracking, gender and craving during the sessions predicted return to use at 3-month follow up (41 participants). \n\nConclusions\nOur work demonstrates that involuntary sign-tracking to cues signalling non-drug reward is associated with problematic alcohol use and return to use at 3-month FU, in a treatment-seeking sample. Whether this automatic prioritisation of cues signalling reward is a consequence or vulnerability for problematic drug use remains to be seen.",

          "abstract": "This work aims to characterize the segregation of Research Support Staff (RSS) in CONICET Argentina by gender, area of ​​knowledge and others characteristics through the request for public data of this personnel. It was determined that in August 2024, there are 2,931 active support staff working in 348 Institutes, and the amount of RSS assigned to each institution varies between 1 and 47. The institutes with the largest number of support staff by area of ​​knowledge are: the INTEMA (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencia y Tecnología de Materiales) in the KA area (Agrarian, Engineering and Materials Sciences) with 47 RSS, followed by the MACNBR (Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales) in the KB area with 42 RSS, the CADIC (Centro Austral de Investigaciones Científicas) in the KE area with 38 RSS, and in the KS area there are two institutes that compete to be in first place with 14 RSS, which are: the CEIL (Centro de Estudios e Investigaciones Laborales) and the CAICYT (Centro Argentino de Información Científica y Tecnológica).\tRegarding gender segregation by area of ​​knowledge, the feminized areas are: KB (Biological and Health Sciences), KS (Social Sciences and Humanities) and the masculinized areas: KA (Agrarian, Engineering and Materials Sciences); KE (Exact and Natural Sciences) and Not Applicable. The KT (Technology) area does not count any RSS personnel. It's curious that for the case of KA area (Agrarian, Engineering and Materials Sciences), the trend found for CONICET researchers is not reproduced by RSS because for them it is feminized, making it necessary to investigate the reasons for this deeply. The two areas with the largest number of support personnel assigned are KE: Exact and Natural Sciences; being masculinized, and KB: Biological and health sciences, being feminized. This analysis is a contribution to comprehension of the characteristics of CONICET's teem infrastructure roles, in order to advance the understanding of their work problems and barriers to professional growth.",

          "abstract": "AI agents are the newest addition to our repertoire of intelligent machines. Powered by large language models and connected to other tools and robots, AI agents not only perform tasks, but they can design a workflow and employ other available tools and digital resources like datasets to carry out a compound task. AI agents are also being employed by researchers to conduct multi-step experiments or stimulate human behavior to perform social science studies. AI agents can transform various research endeavors through efficiency gains, increased productivity and reducing human errors in research and education. However, given their limitations like errors and biases, they also introduce specific risks. In this paper we highlight six specific risks such as errors and biases, loss of research jobs, loss of critical thinking and deskilling scientists, increased possibility of machine-driven misconduct and the increased rate of unverified research results. We conclude that researchers need training in areas such as algorithmic and AI literacy, to be able to identify biases, errors, and other problems in tasks conducted by AI agents. Institutions need to pay more attention to the development of these technologies and provide guidance about their use.",

          "authors": "Casey Roulette",
          "abstract": "Background: Tobacco use and food insecurity (FI) often co-occur and may influence each other bidirectionally. While cross-sectional studies primarily focus on tobacco use's impact on FI, they typically rely on self-reported measures of tobacco use. This study aimed to investigate the effects of food insecurity on cotinine concentrations, a biomarker of nicotine exposure, and evaluate mediating and moderating factors. \nMethods: Data from the 2015–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were analyzed for 2,843 adult smokers. Cotinine was log-transformed and modeled using generalized linear models, adjusted for socio-demographic covariates, body mass index (BMI), and depression score. Casual mediation analysis and structural equation modeling assessed mediation and moderation effects, with interaction terms between FI and covariates to test for moderation. \nResults: Each unit increase in FI severity was linked to a 33.6% rise in cotinine concentrations, controlling for covariates. Depression partially mediated this relationship, while college graduation moderated it. Among females, but not males, BMI mediated and depression moderated the association. In a subset of participants, smoking frequency also moderated the link, with FI weakening the relationship between smoking frequency and cotinine levels. \nConclusions: FI may be an independent risk factor for higher cotinine concentrations, separate from smoking behavior and depression. These findings suggest that addressing FI could enhance tobacco cessation efforts. Future research should explore how FI influences nicotine metabolism and smoking patterns.",

In this paper, we discuss our game of “broken telephone” where instructions and objects were passed on to each other in a game of iterative play. In our year-long engagement, multiple instances of play formed a series of intertextual interventions that allowed us to co-encounter and co-experience each other’s sites. In this process, emergent attunements at one site were passed on as further and transposable provocations to the next player, allowing each of us to re-engage with our individual site in different registers while recomposing subsequent offerings for the next player. Our experience taught us the value of collaborative play and the spirit of experimentation in exploring alternative modes of conducting fieldwork. Our research further addresses the moments of vulnerability and loneliness behind ethnographic fieldwork by emphasizing how common associations can be created and drawn upon to design a more collective field experience.",

          "abstract": "The way we perceive the movement of two intersecting discs can be influenced by auditory information. When a brief tone is played while these discs overlap, people tend to report that the discs bounce off each other instead of streaming past each other. This is known as the auditory-induced bouncing/streaming illusion. Both perceptual/attentional as well as decisional processes have been discussed as explanations for the bouncing/streaming illusion. In four experiments, we study how the abruptness of tone onsets and offsets affects the bouncing/streaming illusion. We found that tones with more abrupt onsets and offsets resulted in a higher proportion of bouncing impressions than those with smoother ones (Experiment 1). This effect was not due to differences in loudness between the tones (Experiment 2). Additionally, we found that the abruptness of the tone onset, rather than the offset, caused the increase in bouncing impressions (Experiment 3). This effect was observed regardless of the temporal alignment of the tones with the moment of visual overlap (onset-aligned vs. centered vs. offset-aligned; Experiment 4). In sum, our results revealed evidence in favor of a chain of perceptual as well as decisional processes contributing to the reported bouncing/streaming impressions, and we discuss how both might interact during the resolution of the ambiguous bouncing/streaming display.",

          "abstract": "Preventing undesired pregnancies in different-sex relationships requires ongoing actions and decisions from both partners. However, the burden of contraception is not equally shared. Most modern contraceptive methods are designed for female bodies, and women are typically responsible for managing contraception, from obtaining prescriptions to dealing with side effects. This contraceptive labor encompasses financial, time, physical and emotional costs – forming an often-overlooked aspect of unpaid labor that parallels housework and childcare in its gendered distribution.\nUsing 2021 data from the German Family Demography Panel (FReDA), we build on the “ContraIndex” to quantify the costs and risks of different contraceptive methods. Situating contraception within the framework of the gendered division of labor, we examine how women’s relative resources and gender ideology shape their contraceptive labor using OLS-regression techniques. \nOur findings suggest that higher-educated women use contraception requiring more contraceptive labor, while those working equal or greater hours than their male partners perform less contraceptive labor. Traditional gender ideology is linked to higher contraceptive labor, also for women who inherit higher relative resources than their male partners. Our results highlight a complex interplay between within-couple predictors and contraceptive behavior, underscoring the need for further research on contraceptive labor as an overlooked dimension of gender inequality.",

Nevertheless, these platforms depend on intricate algorithmic systems to execute various analytical processes and functions, which are fundamental to algorithmic operations. Algorithms go through large chunks of user data and how users behave in order to maximize user engagement. On the other hand, this infrastructure is developed with the intention of keeping the users on the platform for prolonged periods by serving content, ads and videos that are in sync with a user’s interests or likely to get a response. The research looks into the algorithmic work of social media — specifically, how algorithms of social media curate, filter and prioritize a content based upon user data. This study builds on work that has begun to explore algorithmic processes on social media platforms, focusing on how algorithms combine user data to curate, filter, and frontage content.

          "abstract": "Crimmigration scholarship examines the intersection of criminal law and migration control, and has \nlargely focused on the excessive criminalization of people on the move and solidarity activists. This, \nhowever, captures only part of the story: While migration is increasingly criminalized, state-perpetrated crimes against people on the move are rarely penalized in criminal justice systems, despite widespread accounts of border violence and serious harms suffered by migrants at the hands of Western states. This perspective has not yet been thoroughly addressed within the crimmigration \ndebate – a gap that is filled in this paper. Drawing on critical criminology and the concept of ‘criminal \nselectivity’, this article unveils state-perpetrated crimes against migrants as another face of \ncrimmigration. It illustrates how Western states use criminal law both excessively against migrants \nand solidarians, and sparingly against public officials, in the pursuit of controlling migration. These \ninterrelated mechanisms – conceptualized as over- and under-criminalization – form two sides of the \nsame coin, and capture the instrumentalization of criminal law in Western migration governance. By \nunpacking this selective criminalization, the paper contributes to a more holistic crimmigration \ndebate, developing a counter story to the predominant crime-migration nexus by shifting the focus \naway from migrant criminality towards criminal state conduct. This reframing not only challenges \nthe selective focus of crimmigration scholarship, but also lays the theoretical groundwork for \nreducing impunity around harmful migration control practices through the application of criminal \nlaw.",

          "abstract": "While the fundamental link between place and inequality is well investigated, causal studies on neighborhood effects are limited. Using nationwide administrative data from Germany and a quasi-experimental identification approach, we investigate how employed network ties and role models in the residential neighborhood shape individual-level employment. In exploiting variation over time, within cities and between 1x1 kilometer grid cells, we provide a causal estimate of gendered neighborhood employment effects on refugee women's employment probability. Results support direct job referral effects of full-time employed female neighbors, which is most potent for other neighborhood women from refugee countries. Analyses of locally prevalent female work norms show a positive one-off effect of higher part-time employment shares of native neighbors indicating that neighbors serve as role models only before other structures are settled. In analyzing neighborhood effects by sex and nationality, our study reveals that even weak neighborhood ties can provide valuable resources for disadvantaged social groups in the labor market. Hence, the study stresses the necessity to break down dichotomies such as gender and ethnicity when not only explaining but also finding alternative pathways for circumventing combined hurdles of intersectionality.",

However, these percentages were computed incorrectly. Data from the NSFG are re-analyzed, ensuring comparable sample universes by age, correctly applying sampling weights, and including data from 2002. Following a small decline between 2006 and 2015 (10.7%-12.1%), the percent of men who were childfree between 2015 and 2019 (14.2%-15.7%) returned to the levels observed in 2002 (14.3%). Bozick's (2023) original conclusion, that the percentage of men who are childfree has grown considerably, is inconsistent with these revised analyses. Childfree men, and childfree adults in general, are a large and understudied demographic group that warrants greater attention, but researchers should exercise caution when studying trends in childfree prevalence.",

This novel approach offers a comprehensive evaluation of childcare arrangements, revealing, under a potential outcome framework, their overall relevance and the specific channels driving social disparities: unequal exposure (prevalence), heterogeneous effects, and selection (within-group treatment propensity) Using the newborn cohort of the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS - SC1), we assess the impact of early childhood education and care (ECEC), family day-care, grandparental care, and exclusive parental care on children’s competencies in mathematics and vocabulary at ages 4 and 5. Findings reveal center-based ECEC as the most effective in reducing social disparities, benefiting children from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Conversely, exclusive parental care and family day-care widen disparities, favoring higher socio-economic groups while negatively affecting those from lower ones. This approach proved highly useful in identifying both beneficial and detrimental impacts, offering valuable insights into the nuanced role of childcare arrangements in shaping early social inequalities in children’s competencies.",

          "authors": "Yuhan Fang; Kohei Kawaguchi",
          "abstract": "In response to growing privacy concerns, many browsers have implemented restrictions on third-party cookies and cross-site tracking in online advertising. Advertisers are concerned that such retargeting prohibition policies could lead to a reduction in ads' click probability, thereby affecting the bid values. This paper investigates the economic consequences of prohibiting retargeting in online advertising by analyzing data from a demand-side platform (DSP). Our analysis shows that the DSP's bid values for non-retargeted impressions on Google Chrome are more than 60\\% lower than those for retargeted impressions. Yet this difference understates the true disparity in bid values, as retargeting status is observable only for internal auction winners. By modeling the internal auction process and estimating advertisers' valuations, we identify even larger differences between retargeted and non-retargeted impressions: 76.04% for Android and 71.40% for Windows. Our counterfactual simulations indicate that a complete ban on retargeting would substantially reduce expected bid values—by 30.06% for Android and 49.84% for Windows users. These results underscore the significant economic tradeoff between enhancing privacy protection and maintaining advertising market efficiency.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Exposure to alcohol advertising is a key influence on adolescent alcohol consumption. Zero-alcohol drinks (&lt;0.5% alcohol by volume) resemble and often share brands with alcoholic drinks, so may function as surrogate alcohol marketing. We examined whether exposure to zero-alcohol advertising was associated with adolescents’ attitudes and consumption intentions toward alcohol.\nMethods: N=382 Australians aged 15 to 17 years completed an online survey where they viewed zero-alcohol advertisements from four parent alcohol brands and reported past exposure and liking of each advertisement, attitudes and consumption intentions toward alcohol products from the parent brand, general attitudes and consumption intentions toward alcohol, self-reported location-based exposure to zero-alcohol advertising, prior consumption of alcohol and zero-alcohol, and demographics. Associations between exposure and liking, attitudes, and consumption intentions were examined using linear mixed effect models and linear regression. \nResults: In unadjusted models, attitudes toward and intentions to consume alcohol from the parent brand were associated with advertisment exposure (attitudes: B=0.55, p&lt;0.001; intentions: B=0.37, p&lt;0.001) and liking (attitudes: B=1.45, p&lt;0.001; intentions: B=0.70, p&lt;0.001). Adjusting for prior zero-alcohol and alcohol consumption, gender, and parent presence during survey completion, associations with liking remained significant (attitudes: B=1.42, p&lt;0.001; intentions: B=0.66, p&lt;0.001). No associations were found between self-reported location-based exposure to zero-alcohol advertising and general attitudes and consumption intentions toward alcohol.\nDiscussion and Conclusions: Findings that adolescents who see and like zero-alcohol advertisements have more favourable attitudes toward and stronger intentions to consume parent alcohol brands suggest these advertisements serve as surrogate marketing and should be included within alcohol advertising regulations.",

          "abstract": "This commentary critically examines Jesper Sørensen’s Why Cultures Persist: Toward a Cultural Immunology, which applies a complex adaptive systems (CAS) perspective to cultural persistence and transformation. Sørensen introduces the metaphor of a \"cultural immune system,\" paralleling biological immunity to processes of cultural regulation, resilience, and adaptation. While this metaphor provides an interesting lens for understanding social dynamics, we argue that it lacks structural precision, empirical support, and integration with other complex systems frameworks.\n\nThe book's strengths lie in its emphasis on distributed biological metaphors, the CAS framework, the Free Energy Principle, and the notion of ritual as a key constitutive element. However, it falls short by inadequately considering the interlocking effects between metabolism, reproduction, and immunity, failing to provide a theoretically usable definition of \"interaction sphere,\" and insufficiently connecting to relevant complex systems research across various fields. Moreover, it risks overextending a limited metaphor, leading to potential misapplications. Sørensen’s work would benefit from incorporating network theory, systems theory, and game theory to provide a more rigorous explanatory framework.\n\nWe question whether \"cultural immunology\" offers substantial conceptual breakthroughs or merely repackages existing insights under a novel terminology. The absence of precise models and empirical validation further limits its theoretical utility. Additionally, cultural persistence likely depends on multiple biological and social analogies—metabolic, reproductive, and nervous system models may be more relevant than immunity alone.\nUltimately, while Sørensen’s work is ambitious and thought-provoking, it falls short as a comprehensive model of cultural evolution. Future research should seek greater precision and empirical grounding, avoiding the pitfalls of overly broad metaphors in explaining cultural dynamics.",

The submission seeks to highlight important considerations relating to the use of technology in secondary schools by SEND students. We place a focus on four key areas: the disparities in digital infrastructure between schools, the tension between digital inclusion and digital stigma, inadequate 'personalisation' of adaptive software, and the lack of evidence for schools to draw on when making decisions about EdTech. We call for a) greater acknowledgement of the disparities in school resources and digital infrastructures that enable and constrain the possible applications of EdTech in secondary school classrooms, and the risk that these disparities will work to exacerbate inequities in SEND student experiences across the country; b) interrogation of the underpinning logic and pedagogies of EdTech and their claims to ‘personalise’ learning for SEND students; and c) a broader evidence base of efficacy or suitability of products for learners with additional needs. Finally, we argue for improved support for teachers and school leaders in developing the skills and knowledge they need to decide which technologies to use in their classrooms, and how best to effectively use them to support SEND students.",

          "abstract": "To address complex societal challenges, governments increasingly need to make evidence-based decisions and require the best available data as input. As much of relevant data is now in the hands of the private sector, governments increasingly resort to purchasing data from private sources. There is, however, scant empirical evidence and a lack of understanding of how governments go about data purchasing. Therefore, we develop a new conceptual-analytical framework to analyze three models of data purchasing by governments: purchasing raw or aggregated data, data analyses, and data-based services. Next, based on Dutch data purchases, we explore the utility of our framework and create an evidence base detailing what data, data analyses, and data-based services Dutch governments purchase from whom, how, and for what purposes in the context of societal challenges. Our results map buyers and sellers of data in the Dutch context, as well as the types of data sold and in which policy domains. We expose a serious lack of transparency in government reporting on data purchasing. We further discuss our results in view of possible archetypes of data purchases and what purchasing strategy implications they have. Lastly, we propose several recommendations to practitioners and a research agenda for academics.",

          "abstract": "The use of advanced analytics in public health policy remains hindered by a disconnect between researchers, policymakers, and technical experts. Bridging this gap requires intentional knowledge translation strategies that facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and real-world application of research findings. Hackathons, which bring together diverse stakeholders in a time-bound, solution-oriented format, offer an approach to addressing this challenge. In January 2025, the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis (MRC-GIDA) and the Centre for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (CEMA) at the University of Nairobi organized the Bridging the Gap Hackathon (BTGH), designed to strengthen collaboration between academia, policy, and public health practitioners in Kenya. The hackathon convened researchers, software engineers, and policymakers to co-develop data-driven tools tackling public health challenges identified by Kenya's Ministry of Health and the Directorate of Veterinary Services. Over five days and using a structured multi-stage process, six interdisciplinary teams developed prototype solutions to improve outbreak surveillance, vaccine deployment, data quality monitoring, and health workforce estimation. This paper reflects on the hackathon’s structure, participant experiences, and project outcomes, highlighting key lessons for future knowledge translation initiatives. Our findings suggest that hackathons can serve as effective platforms for accelerating interdisciplinary research impact, fostering engagement between policymakers and researchers, and promoting the development of public health solutions.",

          "abstract": "Criminological research frequently examines ordinal outcome data, yet the common practice of treating these data as continuous using linear models can obscure patterns, introduce imprecision, and bias estimates. We advocate for the appropriate analysis of ordinal outcomes with ordered regression models. We demonstrate how linear models misrepresent ordinal distributions using simulated data before reanalyzing select results from Pickett, Graham, and Cullen's (2022) study on racial differences in fear of police. Our analysis showcases how ordered regression models, coupled with effective visualization techniques, provide more accurate estimates than linear models—revealing that linear approaches substantially underestimate racial disparities. For instance, cumulative probit models correctly estimate that nearly one-third of Black participants are “very afraid” of police killing them, while linear models underestimate this by nearly two-thirds. By respecting the ordinal nature of data, criminologists can move beyond broad directional statements and quantify effect magnitudes with greater precision, fostering a more robust, evidence-driven discipline capable of addressing its “precision crisis.”",

Despite this substantial body of empirical research, the knowledge is fragmented across disciplines, emphasizing the need for integration to establish a cohesive framework. As laying the groundwork for a unified framework begins with identifying relevant phenomena, this systematic review analyzed 4019 research articles using text mining to detect phenomena associated with radicalization. Author keywords and abstracts were analyzed by examining term frequency as an indicator of relevance and term co-occurrence as an indicator of association. The results reflect themes commonly featured in theory, such as ideology, identity, and social networks, but also identified themes not well-developed in theory. Macro-level phenomena, including the role of the state, economy, elections, policy, and regional factors, as well as micro- and meso-level phenomena like the internet, social media, adolescence, personality, language, education, and mental health, are not sufficiently embedded in theory. The findings further provide the first empirical evidence confirming the fragmentation of research on radicalization. This review represents a crucial step toward synthesizing existing knowledge and advancing a unified understanding of radicalization.",

          "abstract": "Parental leave uptake by fathers represents one pathway to redress the typically unequal division of early childcare. Following the Nordic schema, the Finnish leave system is designed around this concept to encourage leave uptake, but a substantial share of fathers refrain from it. Though there is a substantial body of literature on policy and individual-level motivators of leave uptake, the decision to take leave often occurs in the context of the workplace. Workplace factors are often cited as typical barriers to uptake. We systematically investigated how the most important workplace characteristics are associated with fathers’ parental leave decisions. We used administrative, linked employee-employer Finnish register data and a multilevel Bayesian approach to examine employed first-time fathers’ use of the father’s quota in 2013–2017. Contrary to our expectations, the probability of taking father’s quota did not vary by the gender composition of or gender wage gap within the workplace. Workplace educational level was important, but only for tertiary educated fathers. Increased competitiveness of the workplace lowered the probability of taking the quota. Our findings call for further study on the interplay of individual and contextual factors in fathers’ parental leave uptake.",

          "abstract": "Background: Perinatal mental health conditions are the leading underlying cause of maternal mortality, with 80% of deaths considered preventable. However, factors contributing to or protecting against the development of perinatal mental health conditions remain poorly understood. This study aimed to explore the perspectives of pregnant and postpartum individuals to understand how they experience pregnancy and postpartum, and how such experiences influence their mental health during both perinatal periods (i.e., pregnancy, postpartum). \n\nMethods: Data were obtained from a subset of participants (n = 17) enrolled in a larger prospective cohort study. Semi-structured interviews during pregnancy (n = 10) and postpartum (n = 15) were conducted remotely (i.e., Zoom, phone). Interviews were independently analyzed using inductive thematic analysis, respective to each perinatal period. \n\nResults: Resource accessibility emerged as an overarching theme, with five resources (themes) acting as barriers or facilitators to mental well-being depending on their accessibility. Three resourcessocial support, logistics, and physical healthwere considered influential across both perinatal periods, to varying degrees. When resources were inaccessible during pregnancy, they became barriers to mental well-being, contributing to experiences of loneliness, frustration, worry, an increased mental load, and ultimately, increased stress. These experiences were often intensified postpartum due to unmet expectations of having increased support to manage increases in logistical demands (e.g., domestic labor, caregiving) amid postpartum recovery and workforce participation. Conversely, when resources were accessible, this facilitated mother’s perceived ability to cope with the stress induced by the demands of this life-stage, the COVID-19 pandemic, and other logistical responsibilities.\n\nConclusions: Findings indicate perinatal individuals view their mental health as being shaped by interactions within their socioenvironmental contexts, highlighting societal norms and institutional practices that are perceived to impose unrealistic expectations on perinatal individuals to independently manage caregiving, domestic labor, and workforce participation amid resource inequities. Further research is needed, particularly among groups disproportionately impacted by maternal mortality and social determinants of health (SDoH), to guide policy reforms and public health interventions that create more inclusive, supportive environments to promote perinatal mental health and, in turn, the health of children, families, and the broader population.",

Despite rapid technological advancements, extant literature on human-AI collaboration in healthcare inadequately addresses the intersection of strategic management theories, user-centered design principles, interpretability, and ethical imperatives. This protocol delineates a scoping review designed to map the multifaceted landscape of AI adoption, thereby establishing a robust foundation for further inquiry.\nObjectives:\nThis scoping review protocol aims to systematically map the existing body of evidence on AI adoption and utilization in resource-constrained healthcare settings, with a particular focus on how AI supports decision-making, knowledge exchange, and overall organizational performance. It further seeks to identify and critically evaluate the theoretical frameworks that have been employed in these studies, scrutinizing their relevance to strategic management practices and human-AI collaboration. Additionally, the review will analyze the barriers and enablers influencing AI adoption, propose strategic management insights, and highlight theoretical gaps to inform future research directions that address user-centered design, interpretability, and the ethical dimensions of AI-driven health services.\nEligibility Criteria:\nThe review will include studies investigating AI-enabled interventions (e.g., machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing) in resource-constrained healthcare settings, irrespective of publication date, provided they are available in English. This approach is intended to capture a comprehensive snapshot of the evolving literature.\nSources of Evidence and Methods:\nA systematic search will be conducted across major databases, including SCOPUS, PubMed, and EBSCOhost-Web of Science, in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. An iterative search process will be refined through pilot testing of search strings, and data will be extracted using a pre-specified framework in Covidence. NVivo will be employed to facilitate the thematic synthesis of key analytical categories, including decision-making support, knowledge exchange, operational efficiency, and strategic management dimensions of AI adoption.\nExpected Outcomes:\nThis review is expected to elucidate the multifaceted roles of AI in resource-constrained healthcare settings, reveal limitations within current theoretical frameworks, and provide strategic insights for future research and practice. By integrating perspectives from strategic management and human-AI collaboration, the review aims to contribute toward more sustainable, interpretable, and ethically grounded AI implementations in healthcare.",

As children more commonly live with both of their parents post-separation, discovering the distributional impact of shared residence on parents’ household costs and the level of shared residence child’s cost are of importance. With Reference Budget calculations from Finland, we find a nuanced impact on the costs of children depending on the age of the child, their living arrangement and whether the point of view is mother’s or father’s. These aspects should be carefully considered when assessing the impact of shared residence on households’ economic needs.

To demonstrate this, we use disaggregated data from the US Census Bureau that contains the number of Hispanic people in each ZIP code in the United States broken down by their regional origin (country or territory), along with ZIP code level data of economic connectedness, a strong predictor of socioeconomic mobility created using digital data from social media. Our results show Hispanics of Mexican, Central American, Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Cuban origin tend to live in areas with less economic connectedness than Hispanics of South American and Spanish origin, trends which mirror the overall trends discussed in the current literature. These latter groups, in some cases, have higher indicators of economic connectedness than the average American, Hispanic or not. Better understanding of the nuances among the coherent ethnic subgroups that fall under the panethnic Hispanic umbrella has implications for our understanding of social inequality.",

          "authors": "Renato Fakhoury; Adam B. Lerner; Jarrod Hayes",
          "abstract": "Climate change represents a profound theoretical challenge for IR and adjacent disciplines. It consists simultaneously of a series of disasters, in need of repair and redress, and a creeping unjust structural condition—a new normal with growing pernicious effects that transcend borders, recur over time, and disproportionately burden marginalized communities. Though scholars have developed frameworks for assessing both the episodic and structural aspects of climate change, they have failed to grasp their entangled, compounding effects. To address this gap, we theorize dual vulnerability to climate change as a unique position in debates over climate justice. We do so by drawing on Iris Marion Young’s dichotomy between interactional and structural injustice, but integrating her models to highlight how distinct forms of injustice reinforce and compound each other. The dually vulnerable, we argue, are not merely victims of catastrophic climate events, but also the most disadvantaged by the uneven global playing field climate change creates. The concept of dual vulnerability contributes to IR by highlighting the complex entanglement of discrete environmental damages and structural climate injustice, as well as how the dually vulnerable face a temporal challenge of simultaneously pursuing backward-facing compensation and forward-facing collective reparation action. To highlight our concept’s utility, we apply it to analysis of the UNFCCC’s recently created Loss and Damage Fund.",

          "abstract": "Humanity faces a complex and dangerous global risk landscape, and many different terms and concepts have been used to make sense of it. One broad strand of research characterises how risk emerges from the complex global system, using concepts like systemic risk, Anthropocene risk, synchronous failure, negative social tipping points, and polycrisis. Another strand focuses on possible worst-case outcomes, using concepts like global catastrophic risk (GCR), existential risk, and extinction risk. Despite their clear relevance to each other, only limited connections have been made between these two strands. Here we provide a framework which synthesises the two and shows how emergent properties of the global system contribute to the risk of global catastrophic outcomes. Specifically, the global system generates hazards, amplification, vulnerability, and latent risk, as well as challenges for GCR assessment and mitigation. This systemic lens helps us understand the origins of GCR, provides a useful interface between two deeply related but infrequently connected bodies of work, and provides important insights for risk reduction.",

          "authors": "Barbara Turk Niskac",
          "abstract": "The litter-raking stands of Bela Krajina in Slovenia are taken as a reference point to examine the entanglements of human and more-than-human worlds through the concept of work as an activity that places humans in a relationship with other living beings. In the domestic agricultural economy of the past, the litter-raking stands were used as pastures for livestock in the spring and summer. In the fall, people gathered litter and cut bracken for bedding the livestock that returned to the barns before winter. The practice led to soil degradation and acidification, so that only sparsely growing birch, pine, and undergrowth of bracken, spring heath, and common heather grew on these lands. In the process of modernization and de-agrarization these activities have been abandoned since the 1960s, and the most litter-raking stands have since become overgrown. Today, some of these stands are protected as natural heritage under Natura 2000. They are home to various birds, butterflies, insects, fungi and orchids and are cut only to preserve biotic diversity. Fast reforestation in this context thus points to the importance of moderate human disturbances for biodiversity conservation. Based on a case study of litter-raking stands, this paper acknowledges the ethic of care as inherent to work as a life-sustaining practice where human and non-human well-being are entangled (Krzywoszynska 2020). Furthermore, it explores whether it is possible to consider work as a life-sustaining practice embedded in a more-than-human relationality, reciprocity, and care that recognizes “work of nature” (Battistoni 2017) for ecosystem maintenance as well.",

          "abstract": "Sound causal inference is crucial for advancing the study of science. Incorrectly interpreting predictive effects as causal might lead to ineffective or even detrimental policy recommendations. Many publications in science studies lack appropriate methods to substantiate causal claims. We here provide an introduction to structural causal models for science studies. Structural causal models, usually represented in a graphical form, allow researchers to make their causal assumptions transparent and provide a foundation for causal inference. We illustrate how to use structural causal models to conduct causal inference using regression models based on simulated data of a hypothetical structural causal model of Open Science. The graphical representation of structural causal models allows researchers to clearly communicate their assumptions and findings, thereby fostering further discussion. We hope our introduction helps more researchers in science studies to consider causality explicitly.",

          "abstract": "This essay provides an overview of statistical methods in public policy, focused primarily on the United States. I trace the historical development of quantitative approaches in policy research, from early ad hoc applications through the 19th and early 20th centuries, to the full institutionalization of statistical analysis in federal, state, local, and nonprofit agencies by the late 20th century. I then outline three core methodological approaches to policy-centered statistical research across social science disciplines: description, explanation, and prediction, framing each in terms of the focus of the analysis. In descriptive work, researchers explore *what exists* and examine any variable of interest to understand their different distributions and relationships. In explanatory work, researchers ask *why does it exist* and *how can it be influenced*. The focus of the analysis is on explanatory variables (X) to either (1) accurately estimate their relationship with an outcome variable (Y), or (2) causally attribute the effect of specific explanatory variables on outcomes. In predictive work, researchers as *what will happen next* and focus on the outcome variable (Y) and on generating accurate forecasts, classifications, and predictions from new data. For each approach, I examine key techniques, their applications in policy contexts, and important methodological considerations. I then consider critical perspectives on quantitative policy analysis framed around issues related to a three-part \"data imperative\" where governments are driven to count, gather, and learn from data. Each of these imperatives entail substantial issues related to privacy, accountability, democratic participation, and epistemic inequalities—issues at odds with public sector values of transparency and openness. I conclude by identifying some emerging trends in public sector-focused data science, inclusive ethical guidelines, open research practices, and future directions for the field.",

          "authors": "Andrés Castro Araújo; Nicolas Restrepo Restrepo Ochoa",
          "abstract": "Contemporary sociology finds itself in an awkward position. Despite having declared the death of functionalism, some form of functionalist argument still remains cryptically present in much substantive research. We argue that this inability to talk plainly about functions is a major hindrance for theory building in the discipline. As such, this article has two goals. The first is disambiguation. What does it mean to attribute a function to something? We answer this question by elaborating on the distinction between proper functions (responding to why-is-it-there questions) and role functions (responding to how-does-it-work questions). The second is to introduce a typology of functional arguments that builds upon this distinction. This allows us to recast “functionalism” as a set of general explanatory strategies and not as a substantive theory about society. This framework enables us to better evaluate, challenge, and improve upon much of the sociological research that currently relies on these forms of argument. Importantly, these forms of argument are not burdened with the problems associated with the organicist framework many sociologists have in mind when they think of functionalism.",

          "abstract": "Current research funding systems are subject to structural imbalances, where formal criteria such as the H-index and the number of publications dominate over the potential and actual scientific prospects of researchers. This leads to the suppression of potential breakthrough research directions and limited access to grants for stochastic (innovative) researchers. In this paper, we propose a dynamic agent-based model of research grant redistribution that takes into account the adaptive mechanism of funding redistribution on the basis of the quality of stochastic research.\n\tThe simulation was conducted on a sample of 21,534 Kazakhstani researchers with 30 iterations, during which the growth of the formal features of stochastic scientists was analyzed under different grant distribution scenarios. A grant redistribution parameter λ was introduced, which controls adaptive funding. The results showed that at λ=0.15, stochastic scientists begin to catch up with formal scientists in terms of productivity without destabilizing the scientific system.\n\tOn the basis of the data obtained, a principle called the Haderach principle was proposed. It consists of a dynamic balance between formal (stable) and stochastic (informal) science. The developed approach can be used to optimize grant systems, allowing the elimination of barriers to new scientific directions and potential achievements without losing the stability of traditional schools.\n\tNew concepts and terms of scientific vocabulary are introduced: the Haderach principle, excluded science, supplemented science, grant monopoly, and so on.\n\tArticle structured V new IRPAS (Induction, Related Works, Processing, Analysis, Synthesis) notations.",

          "title": "Bail out the money printer?  The impact of fiscal indemnity on central bank profitability",
          "authors": "Dianyi Yang",
          "abstract": "Since 2022, central bank losses have been prevalent in advanced economies due to previous quantitative easing and recent inflationary pressures. This paper focuses on the unique case of the United Kingdom, where the government promised in advance to cover any central bank losses arising from quantitative easing. This promise is known as the indemnity. A game-theoretical model is proposed to explain the causes and effects of such indemnity. The model's predictions about the indemnity's effect on central bank profitability are empirically examined. Using the novel Dynamic Multilevel Latent Factor Model (DM-LFM), the indemnity is found to have significantly boosted the Bank of England's profits in the deflationary environment after 2008, but exacerbated its losses under the recent inflationary pressure since 2022. The theoretical model suggests the pronounced effects are due to the Bank of England's high sensitivity to losses and the UK government's moderate fiscal liberalism. Therefore, the British experience should not be generalised. Nevertheless, the theoretical and empirical lessons can inform policy-makers about future institutional designs concerning the fiscal-monetary interactions and the public finance-price stability trade-off.",

          "authors": "Allison Goldberg",
          "abstract": "This study examines the movement against “progressive” prosecutors in the United States. Prosecutors have significant discretion at the front-end of the criminal legal system, including over charges, bail recommendations, and plea deals. Although prosecutors have traditionally wielded their power in a way that contributes to mass incarceration, “progressive” prosecutors have been elected in growing numbers since 2016 on pledges to mitigate the racialized harms of the criminal legal system. While scholars tie the rise of progressive prosecutors to the Movement for Black Lives (BLM), less is known about the countermovement efforts – such as recalls, impeachments, and suspensions – challenging these prosecutors’ discretion and tenures. To address this gap, I constructed an original database of all local prosecutors in 2012 and/or 2022 in the country's 300 most-populous jurisdictions. Through archival research, I documented prosecutor demographics, state politics, and extra-electoral challenges, which I define as organized efforts to remove prosecutors from office or constrain their power outside of regularly-scheduled elections. Findings reveal that extra-electoral challenges disproportionately target women of color prosecutors, disproportionately occur in Republican-controlled states, and have nearly tripled over the last decade. I argue that extra-electoral challenges constitute a novel movement repertoire used by the political right to legally mobilize against racial justice efforts following BLM.",

          "abstract": "Malaysia has been one of the oldest and most unwavering allies of China in South East Asia.\nIt was the first country to diplomatically recognize China in the region and continues to\nmaintain a close diplomatic and economic relationship with China. Chinese territorial claims\nover the potentially resource-rich South China Sea waters and its islands have caused great\nunrest among the littoral countries, especially Vietnam and the Philippines. The problem is\ncompounded by the multitude of claims made by these same countries over each other’s\nterritory. The parties to this dispute, with the exception of China, happen to be members of\nASEAN. Chinese claims, based on their own interpretation of historical and jurisdictional\nevidences; challenge the territorial integrity of these states. Malaysia, as one of the founding\nmembers of ASEAN and one of the largest economies in the region, wields significant\ninfluence over her fellow members-states and could have emerged as a crucial mediator and\npeacekeeper between the China and the South East Asian countries. However, Malaysia has\nadopted a cautious approach in dealing with the South China Sea issue, refraining from\nopenly condemning Chinese actions and lodging protests only when her own territorial\nintegrity is repeatedly challenged. Such caution has ensured Malaysia bountiful trade with\nChina, along with cordial diplomatic and even military relations which have brought the two\ncountries very close. However, recent events of Chinese aggression have led Malaysian\nleaders and the public to question their country’s stance. Ethnic Malays bear grudges for the\nethnic Chinese minority in Malaysia, considered disproportionately rich. Malaysian\ngovernment will also be fearful of Chinese incursions in their territories which are rich in\npetroleum resources. It can therefore be assumed that although Malaysia will tolerate Chinese\nactions for reasons of trade and security, she will not abandon the other ASEAN states and\nopenly side with China. Malaysia’s policy in the South China Sea issue had been and in all\nprobability, will continue to be one of diplomatic tightrope walking.",

Using “A history of socialist thought from the precursors to the present” by Mukherjee and Ramaswamy (2000) as data, this paper utilizes qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) method to find the combination of characteristics that make up socialist thoughts, and political compass to visualize the positions of socialist thoughts. These common characteristics are categorized into groups of Goal and implementation, International view, Politics, Economy, Society, Democratic institution, Revolutionary action, and Revolutionary forces. Among them, Politics, Society, and Revolutionary action groups can be considered to have causal relationship with socialist thoughts. Most socialist thoughts are on the Libertarian left quadrant of the political compass. The methods in this paper have the potential to combine the strengths and limit the weakness of both qualitative and quantitative methods in more comprehensive research of socialist thoughts, for better application of socialism in practice in the future.",
