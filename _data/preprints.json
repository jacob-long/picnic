          "authors": "Malik Oyewale Salami; Corinne McCumber; Jodi Schneider",
          "abstract": "Post-retraction citation may be partly due to authors’ and publishers' challenges in systematically identifying retracted publications. To investigate retraction indexing quality, we investigate the agreement in indexing retracted publications between 11 database sources, restricting to their coverage, resulting in a union list of 85,392 unique items. We also discuss common errors in indexing retracted publications. Our results reveal low retraction indexing agreement scores, indicating that databases widely disagree on indexing retracted publications they cover, leading to a lack of consistency in what publications are identified as retracted. Our findings highlight the need for clear and standard practices in the curation and management of retracted publications, in order to reduce inadvertent post-retraction citation and draw sound conclusions.",

          "authors": "Charlotte Jeppsen; Bob McMurray",
          "abstract": "Purpose: The efficacy of the Cochlear Implant (CI) in listeners with single-sided deafness (SSD) was evaluated by comparing single-ear speech perception in SSD listeners and bilateral cochlear implant listeners (BCI).\n\nMethods: Consonant-nucleus-consonant (CNC) speech perception scores for the CI-only ear in SSD listeners (N=55) were compared to single-ear performance in age and device experience-matched  BCI listeners (N=55). Separate analyses examined: (1) the first-implanted ear in sequential BCI listeners, matched to the same ear in SSD listeners, and (2) the lower-performing ear in BCI listeners. Models included moderators like age, time since implantation, CI usage, and etiology. An additional analysis compared first and second implants for sequential BCI listeners.\n\nResults: SSD listeners consistently showed lower CNC scores than BCI listeners after controlling for age, time since implantation, CI usage, and etiology. Sequential BCI listeners exhibited lower CNC scores on their second ear, compared to their first ear. \n\nConclusion: Speech perception with CIs is reduced in SSD listeners compared to BCI users, likely due to blocking, where the normal-hearing ear diminishes reliance on the CI. Lower performance in the second implanted ear of sequential BCI listeners also suggests greater reliance on the more experienced ear. These findings highlight the need for additional training, resources, and support to optimize CI performance in SSD listeners, despite prior evidence of positive CNC outcomes.",

          "title": "It’s time to ConNECT: Towards a Comprehensive Understanding of Meaningful Interpersonal Moments in Psychotherapy and Beyond",
          "authors": "Niclas Kaiser; Juan Camilo Avendano-Diaz",
          "abstract": "Relational neuroscience struggles to capture the complex dynamics of shared interpersonal moments, leading to gaps in understanding whether and how interdependencies between interacting persons translate into something meaningful. Current neuroscientific research often focuses on motor synchronization and cognition rather than the implicit relational qualities central to psychotherapy. We argue that this disconnect stems from an over-reliance on simplified quantitative methods, a failure to centralize experiential factors, and the lack of convergent research. Drawing on emerging frameworks such as 4E cognition (embodied, enacted, extended, and embedded) and MoBI (Mobile Brain/Body Imaging), we advocate for integrating subjective and experiential elements with neural data. We propose focusing on \"qualities\" in multi-brain neuroscience—moving beyond binary or linear scales—to better capture the subtleties of relational moments. Finally, we emphasize the importance of convergence research across disciplines to better understand what interpresence holds. If psychotherapeutic knowledge is used to guide neuroscientists in what to look for, this multi-disciplinary approach holds promise for advancing the study of psychotherapy's relational processes, offering new insights into the neurobiology of meaningful moments in therapy and elsewhere. We propose ConNECT (Convergent research including Neuroscience and Experiences, Capturing meaningful dynamics with Therapists’ knowledge) as the path forward.",

          "authors": "Mirijam Schaaf; Garvin Brod; Jasmin Breitwieser",
          "abstract": "Implementation intentions could be a promising metacognitive strategy for self-regulated learning. They could help students increase the likelihood of studying by planning when and where to study. In a 42-day micro-randomized trial in an authentic real-world setting, we examined the effectiveness of planning prompts to increase children’s engagement with a vocabulary learning app. Children (N = 357) received mobile prompts in the evening asking them to formulate appropriate implementation intentions for the next day, that is, if-then plans specifying when and where they would like to study vocabulary.\nResults indicated that planning prompts were not effective per se; rather, the effectiveness of planning depended crucially on the quality of the plan. Using a newly developed rubric to classify plan quality based on the specificity, saliency, and contextual aspects of the plan, we show that the higher the plan quality, the more likely children were to study the next day. These findings suggest that well-formulated if-then plans are a useful metacognitive strategy for action control, helping to increase the likelihood of studying.\nFor children to use this metacognitive strategy to plan their own studying, researchers and teachers need to ensure that they explain it carefully, provide examples of high-quality plans, and preferably scaffold the creation of plans by providing feedback.",

          "authors": "Matthew O Parker; Jude Rolfe-Tarrant; Antony Wood; Ed Redhead",
          "abstract": "Spatial navigation problems are regularly reported in older adults and represent a significant challenge to quality of life. This study aimed to understand navigational strategies in older adults using a virtual honeycomb-shaped maze. We have previously shown in this maze that younger individuals, aged 18 to 40, typically adopt a strategy of alternating their turns at successive junctions, while those aged 70 and above show significantly fewer alternations. One theory explaining this behavior in older adults is diminished spatial working memory. In the current study, we tested ways to support spatial knowledge of the environment: by providing either distal cues or a map of the environment, with only the former expected to facilitate spatial working memory. We asked younger (n = 107, aged 18-40) and older (n = 77, aged ≥70) participants to navigate a virtual honeycomb-shaped maze.  Without additional cues, older adults made fewer sequential alternations compared to younger participants. However, when provided with distal cues, older adults increased their sequential alternations, whereas the map did not have the same effect. The findings suggest that spatial memory limitations in older adults affect navigational choices, but providing certain types of environmental cues, such as distal cues, can help compensate for these limitations. This could have implications for designing environments to enhance independence in older adults and in the design of cognitive tests for spatial working memory.",

Black, Hispanic, and Asian participants (Study 1; N = 931) and women (Study 2; N = 1207) from the United States imagined someone made a discriminatory comment to them and rated the likelihood of being supported by an individual who varied in identity and past solidarity-related behavior. Participants anticipated more support from their own racial/ethnic group for racism and from women for sexism, and then anticipated support by the following groups: Black &gt; Hispanic &gt; Asian ≥ White and women &gt; men. Past behavior boosted anticipated support, especially from outgroups. Strikingly, we found solidarity imbalances; groups consistently anticipated that Black people would support them, yet Black people anticipated lower support from racial/ethnic outgroups.",

This study assesses the benefits and challenges associated with a codesigned writing retreat for part-time doctoral students.\n\nDesign: This narrative case study draws on multiple data sources (including an online survey, a focus group, and event feedback forms) to discuss the co-production, delivery and evaluation of a residential writing retreat, designed with and for part-time doctoral students.\n\nFindings: The co-production stage of the project emphasised part-time doctoral students’ priorities in relation to the design of the retreat. This included focusing on creating a distraction-free environment for writing, holding the event across a weekend to accommodate other commitments, and offering travel bursaries for those that lived significant distances from campus. Data gathered from feedback forms showed that the timing, location and content of the retreat met the needs of attendees; enabling them to connect with other doctoral students and make good progress with their writing. The focus group highlighted benefits of the retreat in more detail, including: the importance of peer support, the opportunity for self-reflection and empowerment, and the rarity of an opportunity that met their needs. Implications for practice and challenges encountered are discussed.\n\nOriginality: The needs of part-time doctoral students are often overlooked. This study makes a unique contribution by applying co-production methods to design a residential writing retreat that meets the needs of this group.",

          "authors": "Cat Lucy Jones; Vasileios Sideropoulos; Olympia Palikara",
          "abstract": "Parental engagement is known to positively influence children’s educational outcomes. However, it remains unclear whether teachers in England are sufficiently equipped to facilitate effective parental engagement. We therefore conducted a national online survey of 1782 qualified teachers in England, to explore their parental engagement training, knowledge, skills and factors influencing those skills. \n\nWe identified concerning training gaps, with most teachers receiving no training in which types of parental engagement are most effective or how to identify and remove barriers to parental engagement. Only a minority of teachers recognised the importance of parent-child interactions in their conceptualisation of parental engagement, with many seemingly preoccupied with less effective school involvement activities. Teachers’ parental engagement skills were associated with their self-efficacy, experience, workload, training route and other factors. \n\nThe findings suggest that teachers require better training to prepare them to facilitate effective parental engagement with learning. This study makes an important contribution to the development of future training by pinpointing specific gaps in teachers’ parental engagement knowledge and skills, and identifying predictors of those skills. As such, it has implications for teachers, teacher educators, school leaders and policymakers, aiming to optimise parental engagement practices to enhance children's educational outcomes.",

          "authors": "Astrid Emilie Lund; Hayley Ridley; Kamilla Bobyreva; Juliet Foster; Charlotte Russell; Freiin von Stein zu Nord- und Ostheim1",
          "abstract": "Objectives: This study aimed to examine how older adults form beliefs about their memory and how these beliefs are influenced by their level of concern about dementia. Inaccurate beliefs and excessive worrying, indicative of erroneous metacognition, are associated with negative health outcomes. This research can help identify mitigation for these harmful effects. \n\nDesign: Qualitative focus groups; thematic analysis\n\nSetting: Focus Group discussion with healthy older adults hosted at a university in central London.\n\nParticipants: Thirty-five healthy older individuals (Female = 29) without any psychiatric or neurological diagnoses, over the age of 65 (mean 75.31, SD: 6.15). Thirteen participants were identified as having a high level of worry about dementia and 22 as having low worry. Groups were matched for cognitive performance on the Telephone Mini Addenbrooke’s cognitive assessment (Tele-MACE).\n\nOutcome Measures: Participants were assigned to a focus group depending on their level of worry about dementia. During focus groups a vignette prompted discussion around lifespan changes in memory and how this affected concerns around memory. This allowed investigation of the differences in beliefs about memory. \n\nResults: Thematic Analysis revealed two key themes. First, older adults appear to base their definition of ‘normality’ of their own memory on comparisons. These comparisons were between themselves and others; and between themselves now and their own past self. Second, there was a key difference between those with high versus low worry; those with high worry consistently attributed dementia as directly relevant to themself. \n\nConclusion: Comparison is a common metacognitive strategy used in forming beliefs about memory. Targeting the use of comparison is potentially valuable in interventions aiming to alleviate older adults’ memory concerns. Addressing self-focused thinking, e.g., with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, could improve harmful levels of high worry.",

          "abstract": "Nonlinear relationships among variables play an important role in psychological modeling and understanding changes over time from intensive longitudinal data (ILD). Most methods focus on linear models, with a few exceptions developed for specific nonlinear interactions or general system dynamics. Methods considering multiple possible nonlinear relationships among all variables remain sparse, hindered by challenges like overfitting and interpretation difficulties. This article examines the feasibility of applying such a method to psychological ILD, using the Regularization Algorithm under Marginality Principle (RAMP) alongside a local linearization method for interpretation. We evaluated its performance with simulated and empirical datasets using classification metrics, information criteria, and cross-validation. Results show this method often requires long series for satisfactory performance. While information criteria favor the nonlinear method in empirical datasets, cross-validation favors simpler AR models. Nonetheless, these challenges are comparable to those in linear idiographic modeling. Clear evidence of nonlinear relationships among variables supports the value of this method for exploratory studies. We developed an R package, quadVAR, as an implementation of this method.",

          "abstract": "Background: While growing research confirms the efficacy of transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (TD-CBT) by examining group-level changes from pre to post-treatment, less is known about inter-individual differences and dynamic changes during therapy. Understanding different symptom trajectories and their associations with treatment outcome would allow early detection of non-responders and treatment adjustments.\n\nMethods: Patients with anxiety disorders reported on demographics, clinical history, treatment motivation, and expectations before randomization to TD-CBT or wait-list. We analyzed data from the treatment group who provided symptom ratings every session and post-treatment follow-up (N = 64, 71.9% female, age: M = 32.67, SD = 11.91). Using latent class growth analysis (LCGA), we identified symptom trajectory classes and tested whether these could be predicted from baseline data. We also examined associations between classes and treatment outcome, using multilevel modeling and considering reliable change indices. \n\nResults: LCGA revealed four distinct trajectory classes: low severity - improved (32.81%), high severity - improved (29.69%), high severity-stagnant (18.75%), and low severity - worsened (18.75%). Only number of comorbidities emerged as a significant predictor of class, with patients in the high severity - stagnant group having more comorbidities. They also showed higher symptom severity at baseline and follow-ups compared to other classes, despite clear improvement.\n\nConclusions: During TD-CBT, latent classes of symptom change can be distinguished and point to malleable factors already present at pre-treatment. Particularly patients with high initial burden and a higher number of comorbidities may require monitoring and adaptive treatment strategies, which should be explored in future studies.",

          "abstract": "‘Association’ is certainly one of the most prevalent terms in cognitive sciences. However, its diversity of meanings is underestimated. We show that dozens of expressions are used to denote ‘associative' phenomena, mechanisms or models, which constitute an overwhelming galaxy of terms and hamper understanding of an apparently simple concept: association. This semantic divergence brings along conceptual issues and prevent associative accounts of brain function or behavior from being properly articulated, understood and criticized. We propose four main, distinct concepts that allow to clarify and identify what researchers mean with ‘association’ across various disciplines: neuroscience, psychology, AI, linguistics, philosophy. By providing clear definitions of the four concepts, together with guidance in assigning term meaning, we hope to promote interdisciplinary collaboration around the central explanatory notion of association, and acceptance of its complexity and richness.",

Experiment 2 (n = 62) demonstrated that applying anodal tDCS to the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) reduced this preference. Chronic exclusion also led to a preference for immediate rewards (Experiment 3, n = 170), but multiple anodal tDCS sessions in the right vlPFC lessened this effect, suggesting long-term benefits (Experiment 4, n = 36). We discuss how self-control mediates the link between exclusion and intertemporal decision-making, and highlight tDCS as a potential therapeutic tool for socially excluded individuals.",

          "authors": "Brandon Matthew Woo; Adrian Tsang; Kiley Hamlin",
          "abstract": "From their observations of others’ behavior, adults quickly form character impressions. These impressions can be “sticky”, such that adults prioritize information acquired earlier over later information. Developmental psychology has provided some evidence that infants, like adults, may form impressions based on others’ prosocial and antisocial behavior. But how do infants respond to inconsistent behavior? Do infants update their impressions when people behave inconsistently? The present, preregistered experiments examined 11-month-olds’ (N = 189) ability to incorporate inconsistency in their social evaluations. We first successfully replicated the finding that when actors behave consistently, infants prefer looking to helpers over hinderers (Experiment 1). In our key experiments, infants observed an actor who behaved inconsistently (either mostly helping or mostly hindering) paired with an actor who behaved consistently (either always hindering or always helping, respectively). Would infants prefer the actor who was on average more prosocial? We found that infants preferred looking to more prosocial actors, but they did not look longer when an actor’s behavior changed, suggestive that they did not notice the change in behavior. Finally, in Experiment 3, we found that infants’ evaluations of inconsistent actors in Experiment 2 may be due to a primacy bias: a focus on what an actor did first, rather than an ability to incorporate consistency. Together, these findings raise the possibility that infants’ social evaluations are based on their first impressions of others. These findings may reflect a developmental precursor to adults’ “sticky” character impressions.",

Using a nationally representative sample of religious leaders from the National Survey of Religious Leaders (N = 1,600), we tested preregistered hypotheses to examine psychosocial, religious, and spiritual correlates with LGBQ support, as well as potential congregational moderators. Results reveal relatively moderate LGBQ support among religious leaders (M = 2.61, range = 1.0–6.5), with psychosocial factors (e.g., identifying as White, woman, higher education, income) and religious/spiritual struggles associated with greater support, while literal Biblical interpretation and prayer practices associated with lower support. While congregation size did not moderate the relationship between literal interpretation and LGBQ support, the racial composition of congregations did. Together, these findings suggest that congregational dynamics may play a more significant role in shaping religious leaders' LGBQ support than previously recognized; we conclude by highlighting limitations and directions for future studies.",

          "abstract": "Objective:\nWide-ranging psychiatric assessments may improve patient outcomes when their results inform treatment decision-making. Specifically, symptoms relevant to diverse disorders may be expeditiously alleviated when etiology is correctly identified at outset. This study aimed to evaluate how MindMetrix, a wide-ranging statistic-driven assessment, affected the trajectory of symptom improvement in patients at a large outpatient center.\n\nMethods:\nIn this retrospective, pretest-postest non-equivalent study, all patients who initiated treatment at Rochester Center for Behavioral Medicine completed an intake appointment before being assigned to take MindMetrix (n = 97) or commencing treatment without additional assessment (n = 50). Before every visit, patients took a pre-visit survey, which included the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale-2, and the ADHD Symptom and Side Effect Tracking Scale (ASSET). To determine whether MindMetrix adjusted symptom improvement over time, moderation analyses with time in treatment, MindMetrix assignment, and an interaction term examined the interactive effect on PHQ-9, GAD-2, or ASSET scale scores. This analysis included all patient visits after they began treatment at RCBM.\n\nResults: \nThe moderation analyses found improvements in PHQ-9, GAD-2, and ASSET scales as patients proceeded through treatment, independently of their MindMetrix assignment. On the PHQ-9 and ASSET, MindMetrix significantly adjusted the effect of time in treatment, suggesting accelerated improvement.\n\nConclusions:\nResults suggest that MindMetrix is an effective tool that can be used to guide early clinical decisions. Improvements seen in patients who took the MindMetrix assessment support its clinical benefit and potential for broad application in behavioral health and primary care centers.",

Accordingly, numbers are assumed to be mentally represented on a “number line”, with smaller numbers on the left and larger numbers on the right in Western culture. Supporting this, prior findings show a numerical lateralization effect, where participants generating random numbers while turning their heads sideways produce more small numbers when facing left than when facing right. Here, we aimed to replicate and extend these findings by investigating the relative contributions of visual and proprioceptive signals to the spatial-numerical association. Our novel augmented reality setup enabled us to separate visual and proprioceptive cues for horizontal head rotation. We hypothesized that participants would generate more small numbers when facing left in the ordinary visual perspective (normal condition, i.e., proprioceptive and visual cues aligned), and that this tendency would be reduced when the visual axis was inverted (inverted condition). We also used a rod and frame task to assess the individuals’ visual dependency and a newly developed side detection task for head somatomotor rotation sensitivity. We hypothesized that visual dependency would correlate with numerical lateralization, while an inverted pattern would be observed for head rotation sensitivity. Results showed moderate evidence against the effect of head direction, indicating that we were unable to replicate the previously reported effect. Additionally, the moderate evidence against the effect of condition suggests that inverting the visual field did not reduce the frequency of small numbers generated when looking left. These findings imply that the spatial bias in number generation may be less robust or may not generalize to head-mounted display setups.",

          "authors": "Eliane Roy; Jordan Axt",
          "abstract": "Discrimination in the evaluation of others is a key cause of social inequality around the world. However, relatively little is known about psychological interventions that can be used to prevent biased evaluations. The limited evidence that exists on these strategies is spread across many methods and populations, making it difficult to generate reliable best practices that can be effective across contexts. In the present work, we held a research contest to solicit interventions with the goal of reducing discrimination based on physical attractiveness using a hypothetical admissions task. Thirty interventions were tested across four rounds of data collection (total N &gt; 20,000). Using a Signal Detection Theory approach to evaluate interventions, we identified two interventions that reduced discrimination by lessening both decision noise and decision bias, while two other interventions reduced overall discrimination by only lessening noise or bias. The most effective interventions largely provided concrete strategies that directed participants’ attention towards decision-relevant criteria and away from socially biasing information, though the fact that very similar interventions produced differing effects on discrimination suggests certain key characteristics that are needed for manipulations to reliably impact judgment. The effects of these four interventions on decision bias, noise, or both also replicated in a different discrimination domain, political affiliation, and generalized to populations with self-reported hiring experience. Results of the contest for decreasing attractiveness-based favoritism suggest that identifying effective routes for changing discriminatory behavior is a challenge, and that greater investment is needed to develop impactful, flexible, and scalable strategies for reducing discrimination.",

          "abstract": "What are the risky choices people are confronted with in our complex and fast-changing world? This article reports on a set of representative population surveys in Switzerland (N = 4, 380) that collected those risky choices people perceive to be relevant in their own lives or in the lives of a large number of fellow citizens. Based on this empirical basis we developed an inventory of 100 risky choices, which we analyzed to address several open issues of the behavioral sciences, such as regarding the structure of the current ecology of risk (e.g., life domains; stability). Moreover, we employed this inventory with an\nindependent follow-up study (N = 933) to thus address the generalizabilty of the psychological construct of risk preference to real-life choices that are relevant to various subgroups of the population. The five key insights that emerged from developing, analyzing, and employing this inventory may not only be useful for researchers studying decision making under risk and uncertainty (e.g., what criteria to use for the development of novel measurement instruments), but also for policy making and various applied settings (e.g., by mapping who will likely be confronted with which risky choices; how swiftly the\nrisks of modern life change, either spontaneously or in response to a global shock).",

          "abstract": "When solving problems with a clear goal, people often rely on backward reasoning by recursively breaking down a problem into subgoals. The cognitive mechanisms of backward reasoning are poorly understood, and no computational process models have been fitted on human data to explain this problem solving technique. We propose that backward reasoning can be seen as search through a space of subgoals and actions to attain them. We show that this space can be represented by an AND-OR tree, a structure first used in early artificial intelligence research to automate problem solving. We hypothesize that, when solving problems with a clear goal,  people reason backward by searching through AND-OR trees. To test this hypothesis, we collected data from a task where participants rearranged elements within a constrained space to achieve a specific goal. We then developed a psychologically plausible, single-parameter process model which we fit to data from the task on a per-participant basis. We found that our model successfully captured key trends in the data, unlike alternative models. Our results demonstrate a deeper understanding of the underlying cognitive mechanisms of human problem solving.",

          "abstract": "Synchrony has been proposed as a relevant phenomenon for investigating social neurophysiological and psychological processes, with inter-brain synchrony, in particular, presumed to facilitate the functional integration of multiple brains. However, the lack of an accepted definition and a cohesive theoretical corpus that allows hypothesis-based approaches, often combined with inadequate empirical methods, weakens this area of research. To address this, we propose a rigorous definition of inter-brain synchrony and link various theoretical contributions to justify the existence of meaningful temporal alignment between different brain activities. This article outlines a set of methods to provide valid evidence supporting this neural mechanism. Our approach entails extracting instantaneous phase data from Hilbert-transformed EEG time series recorded from individuals under different experimental conditions that account for confounding factors such as shared attention, cognitive, and motor dependencies. We then describe multiple data analysis approaches, including circular statistics combined with permutation testing, and mutual information. Finally, we present an example of a potential application within the context of cooperation in nuclear families. We believe that, by employing such methods consistently, the concept of inter brain synchrony is falsifiable. Whether this phenomenon is empirically supported or not, it will contribute to advancing our understanding of the social brain.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Cannabis is the most popular illicit recreational drug among youth globally. Evidence suggests that long-term heavy use of cannabis is negatively associated with important cognitive functions related to executive functioning, attention, and working memory, learning, and memory. Previous findings link the early onset of cannabis use to more extensive cognitive alterations. However, significant inconsistencies exist across studies. \nMethod: In this cross-sectional study, we examined associations between cannabis use and cognitive performance across a broad range of cognitive tests (including a new test of visuo-spatial abilities, The Ruff-Light Trail Learning Test) in a sample of 109 Danes aged 15-26 with varying risk of developing harmful cannabis use and varying levels of current use. Cannabis use was evaluated using the Cannabis Use Disorder Identification Test-Revised (CUDIT-R) and questions on recent use (past 30 days) and age of onset. Cognitive performance was assessed using subtests from WAIS-IV, WMS-III, and the Ruff-Light Trail Learning Test. \nResults: Findings show a negative association between recent cannabis use and specific cognitive functions of working memory and visual memory, while the CUDIT-R was not associated with cognitive functions. \nConclusion: Our findings nuance previous findings by suggesting differences in vulnerability across cognitive domains, while providing the first evidence of a negative association between recent cannabis use and visual memory based on visuo-spatial functions without requiring visuo-constructive abilities (Ruff-Light Trail Learning Test). Furthermore, findings suggest that past-month use may be a more relevant measure than CUDIT-R when evaluating cognitive correlates of cannabis use in youth. This has implications for treatment and preventive interventions in this age group.",

Participants completed personality questionnaires assessing the constructs of impulsiveness (UPPS-P), time perspective (CFC-14), and mindfulness (FMI). Consistent with previous research, a faster passage of time was associated with reduced attention to time, lower arousal and boredom levels, and more relaxation and positive affect. Mediation analyses revealed that, among all subjective experiences, boredom was the only significant predictor mediating the effect of personality traits on the perceived passage of time. Specifically, individuals (a) prone to rash actions under intense positive affect and (b) who prioritize immediate outcomes over distant future consequences of their actions tended to experience more boredom while waiting, which in turn led to a subjectively slower passage of waiting time. Potential explanations and directions for further research are discussed.\nKey words: waiting, time perception, passage of time, consideration of future consequences, impulsiveness, mindfulness, boredom",

          "abstract": "A great deal of research in dual process models has been devoted to highlighting differences in the structure and function of the implicit and explicit attitude constructs. However, the two forms of attitudes can also demonstrate important shared properties, and prior work suggests that one similarity may be in factors that determine measurement reliability. To better explore this issue, Study 1 analyzed the test-retest reliability in measures of both implicit and explicit attitudes within a single study session across 75 topics (N &gt; 35,000). Explicit attitudes had greater test-retest reliability than implicit attitudes, but each showed considerable heterogeneity across topics, even when measured within a single study session. Analyses also included several candidate moderator variables, such as attitude certainty or familiarity. While results were not identical, the moderators associated with greater test-retest reliability for implicit and explicit attitudes exhibited more similarities than differences. Specifically, attitudes experienced as more distinctive, more relevant to one’s self-concept, more certain, and more accessible had higher test-retest reliability for both forms of evaluation. Variation in short-term reliability for implicit and explicit attitudes was replicated in Study 2, and Study 3 revealed that topics low in short-term reliability were also lower in a longitudinal sample that completed measures separated by several weeks. These results advance our understanding of each attitude construct, and are consistent with a more dynamic relationship between an attitude and its measure, as even attitudes measured with high levels of conscious control could show remarkable short-term instability when assessed only minutes apart.",

For this concern to be founded, the illusory truth effect must act meaningfully on statements that are initially thought to be implausible. Using a large (N=974) online experiment, we test the relationship between the illusory truth effect and prior belief in trivia statements. In contrast to previous work, we measure the prior belief that an individual assigns to a specific statement to allow for a precise estimation of this relationship. Concerningly, we find that not only does the illusory truth effect appear meaningful for statements where participants have low prior belief, the effect is also stronger for these initially implausible statements. Our findings suggest that repetition can be particularly harmful when statements are initially seen as implausible.",

          "abstract": "Drowsy driving is one of the leading contributing factors to traffic accidents. As drivers continue driving despite being aware of their drowsy states, it is necessary to adopt active countermeasures to avoid them falling asleep behind the wheel. Based on the multiple resources model, this study proposed five countermeasure types using voice assistants (no countermeasure vs. meaninglessly listening vs. meaningfully listening vs. repeating vs. answering) and investigated their effects on countering drowsiness of younger (25-35 years) and middle-aged (36-65 years) drivers. A simulated manual driving experiment with 29 participants was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures on driving behaviors, physiological indicators, eye movement indicators, and subjective ratings. All results indicated that the repeating and answering conditions were the most effective in alerting drowsy drivers, suggesting that countermeasures involving more human resource stages can enhance alertness. The trend of higher alertness in the answering condition compared to the repeating condition highlighted the potential advantage of increasing cognitive load in countering drowsiness. Listening conditions showed limited effects on alerting drivers but no adverse effects on driving performance or worsening drowsiness. Regarding age, younger and middle-aged drowsy drivers did not differ on average in response to different countermeasures. However, considering individual differences in physiological activation in reacting to countermeasures, drowsiness countermeasures should be tailored to the individual needs, particularly for middle-aged drivers. Apart from facilitating the understanding of drowsiness countermeasure mechanisms, the present findings provided implications for vehicle designers and engineers in utilizing in-vehicle voice assistants as an effective drowsiness countermeasure.",

          "abstract": "Advances in AI-assisted voice technology have made it easier to clone or disguise voices, creating a wide range of synthetic voices using different accents, dialects, and languages. While these developments offer positive applications, they also pose risks for misuse. This raises the question as to whether listeners can reliably distinguish between human and AI-enhanced speech and whether prior experiences and expectations about language varieties that are traditionally less-represented by technology affect this ability. Two experiments were conducted to investigate listeners’ ability to categorise voices as human or AI-enhanced in both a standard and a regional Scottish dialect. Using a Signal Detection Theory framework, both experiments explored participants' sensitivity and categorisation biases. In Experiment 1 (N = 100), a predominantly Scottish sample showed above-chance performance in distinguishing between human and AI-enhanced voices, but there was no significant effect of dialect on sensitivity. However, listeners exhibited a bias toward categorising voices as “human”, which was concentrated within the regional Dundonian Scots dialect. In Experiment 2 (N = 100) participants from southern and eastern England, demonstrated reduced overall sensitivity and a Human Categorisation Bias that was more evenly spread across the two dialects. These findings have implications for the growing use of AI-assisted voice technology in linguistically diverse contexts, highlighting both the potential for enhanced representation of Minority, Indigenous, Non-standard and Dialect (MIND) varieties, and the risks of AI misuse.",

          "abstract": "Climate skepticism remains a significant barrier to public engagement with accurate climate information, because skeptics actively engage in information avoidance to escape exposure to climate facts. Here we show that generative AI can enhance engagement with climate science among skeptical audiences by subtly modifying headlines to align better with their existing perspectives, without compromising factual integrity. In a controlled experiment (N = 2000) using a stylized social media interface, headlines of climate science articles modified by an open-source large language model (Llama3 70B, version 3.0) led to more bookmarks and more upvotes, and these effects were strongest among the most skeptical participants. Skeptics who engaged with climate science as a result of this intervention showed a shift in beliefs toward the scientific consensus by the end of the study. These results show that generative AI can alter the information diet skeptics consume, with the promise that scalable, sustained engagement will promote better epistemic health. They highlight the potential of generative AI as a tool for truth, showing that while it can be misused by bad actors, it also holds promise for advancing public understanding of science when responsibly deployed by well-intentioned actors.",

          "abstract": "Visual search tasks are commonly used to study how people guide their attention amidst distraction. Developmental studies have used visual search to explore age-related differences in attention. Typical findings show that performance declines and sensitivity to distraction increases in older compared to younger adults. Such findings are taken as evidence of the declining abilities in goal-driven attention. However, standard visual search tasks use static displays and therefore fail to capture the challenges and opportunities in natural environments, which include predictive structures within extended contexts. To investigate how adults of different ages guide their attention in dynamic and extended contexts, we used our recently developed Dynamic Visual Search (DVS). In DVS targets and distractors compete over time and embedded spatiotemporal regularities afford prediction-led guidance of attention. Critically, we manipulated the levels of distraction to chart whether and how benefits of expectations and deficits from distraction varied with age. Younger and older adults searched for multiple visual targets as they faded in and out of the display among distractors while varying the number of distracting elements. Half the targets always appeared at the same time and approximate locations and could be predicted. While we found evidence for decrement and elevated sensitivity to distraction with increasing age, benefits from predictions occurred in all groups. Interestingly, regardless of age, effects of predictions were only significant during periods of high distraction. This work extends our understanding of attention control through ageing to dynamic settings and indicates a dissociation between goal-directed and learning-driven and attentional guidance.",

Through the lens of creating a special issue on identity and migration, this article examines the feasibility of RRs in fostering rigorous, transparent, and contextually grounded scholarship. Seven RRs are reviewed, encompassing diverse methodological approaches and sociocultural contexts, which collectively highlight the fluidity of social identities and the impact of migration on identity formation. In the current article, we reflect on both the content of these studies, as well as the process of cultivating a special issue based solely on RRs. Specifically, we advocate for tailored guidelines that respect the iterative nature of qualitative inquiry, while encouraging the broader adoption of RRs to advance global research on identity and migration.",

In a sample of 764 U.S. service workers who reported their feelings daily for up to 12 weeks, responses were provided in 1) numerical ratings, 2) short essays, and 3) descriptive words.

For external predictive validity across 24 traits, demographics, and behaviors, both language formats doubled the ratings’ accuracy, with words reaching an average of r = .18 and essays r = .24 (p &lt; .001). Beyond their greater accuracy, both language formats offered rich psychological insights, with words focusing on emotions and essays encompassing broader life domains.

Current gold standard approaches draw from two sources of information: simple cognitive assessments of reasoning ability and past forecasting accuracy. Cognitive assessments are well-studied and normed psychometric instruments, but have lower predictive value. Real-world forecasting problems are more challenging to norm a priori: they typically require a large comparison sample of forecasters to make predictive inferences. This paper develops the Forecasting Proficiency Test (FPT): a one-hour test that predicts more than 60% of the variation in out-of-sample forecasting accuracy, double the predictive utility of prior work. We highlight several key results: (1) Eliciting forecasts in a quantile format is considerably more psychometrically reliable, meaning it is more efficient at reducing measurement error about forecasters' expected accuracy with fewer items, than forecasts elicited using the standard probability format common to most judgmental forecasting tournaments. (2) Several cognitive tasks, novel to forecasting research, are highly predictive of forecasting ability. These include denominator neglect, Bayesian updating, and adherence to decision rules. (3) Although our methods do best at separating out the worst forecasters from the population, they are also remarkably effective at identifying elite talent in the upper range of the skill distribution.",

Listeners’ event boundaries were influenced by the amount of tonal context but also reflected nested phrase structure, and musicians were more sensitive to longer-timescale “hyper-phrase” structure (E3; n=95, age 20-42) and could better identify the amount of scrambling (E4; n=108, age 19-41). These results indicate for the first time that listeners integrate context across complex phrases to efficiently encode, predict, and segment naturalistic music and that in general, training has surprisingly little impact on this integration.",

          "title": "Uncertainty monitoring in reasoning: cue consistency is more important than belief-logic conflict",
          "authors": "Veronika Kosourikhina",
          "abstract": "Dual process accounts of reasoning posit that the interactions between automatic Type 1 processes and reflective Type 2 processes are regulated through the mechanism of conflict detection. Conflict detection is thought to be triggered when two or more incompatible responses to a problem are produced. Conflict detection can be viewed as an aspect of metacognition, as both are concerned with monitoring the outputs from the reasoning process as assessing one's certainty in them. In this paper we apply the self-consistency model of metacognition to analyse cues that inform confidence judgements in reasoning, to investigate the potential sources of responses to a given problem. In four experiments (total N = 524), we analysed the relationship between confidence and accuracy on the base-rate task and syllogisms, and used a solution-evaluation task format to manipulate uncertainty experimentally. We found that in both tasks, confidence and accuracy were influenced by many cues, rather than belief-logic conflict exclusively. Belief-logic conflict was a significant cue to confidence in the base-rate task, but not in syllogisms. Across all experiments, items identified as eliciting the most uncertainty, based on the self-consistency model, showed greater conflict detection effects. Introducing an additional cue that was inconsistent with the most common response generally increased uncertainty and conflict detection. These findings support the uncertainty monitoring account of conflict detection and link it with the broader metacognition research.",

          "abstract": "Most written systems share basic shape features with natural objects such as line junctions, a commonality thought to be at the basis of fluent reading. Studies that compared reading acquisition for different scripts used line-based scripts and investigated them in terms of complexity, novelty, or associations of stimuli from different categories. Here, we directly compared a novel, custom-made, line-based script derived from Braille (Line Braille) to visual Braille, a script that only includes patterns of dots and no line junctions. For four consecutive days, two groups of participants underwent online training, during which they first mapped new letters onto the Latin alphabet and then trained on full words. Each day, participants were tested by asking them to transcribe a set of stimuli (words and pseudowords) from the novel to the Latin script. Across sessions, we found no significant differences between scripts in the overall transcription accuracy nor in the time required to transcribe words. We only found a small delay in the learning trajectory of the Braille group represented through an interaction between group and session in overall accuracy, and slightly higher sensitivity for stimulus length in the Braille group. Overall, these results show that line junctions only provide a small and temporary benefit when learning a new script, contrasting with the idea that line junctions is a core visual features for learning orthography.",

          "authors": "Hadar Fisher; Haya Fatimah; Kristina Pidvirny; Hallie Brown; Emma Balkind; Brianna Pastro; Christian A. Webb",
          "abstract": "Objective: Difficulties in emotion regulation during adolescence—a critical period for the development of these abilities—have been linked to depression. Early identification of deficits in emotion regulation may help prevent the onset of depression. This study investigated whether emotion regulation dynamics, particularly the speed of regulation to one’s affective equilibrium (damping) inferred from the Damped Oscillator Model (DOM), could predict future depressive symptoms in adolescents. We hypothesized that the relationship between damping and long-term outcomes would depend on the position of an individual's equilibrium. Methods: Participants (N = 115) aged 12-15 completed smartphone-based EMA for 30 days, rating six emotions four times daily. The DOM was applied to each participant's time series data, yielding person-specific frequency of oscillations (η) and damping (ζ) parameters. These parameters were then used to predict depressive symptoms at 6- and 12-month follow-ups controlling for baseline levels of depression. Results: Results revealed that the interaction between the damping parameter and the equilibrium position significantly predicted depressive symptoms for sadness, but not for other emotions. For individuals with higher equilibrium levels of sadness, stronger damping predicted higher follow-up depressive symptoms. Additionally, higher frequency of oscillation around the equilibrium – representing greater elasticity and less rigidity – of two emotions (interest and happiness) predicted fewer depressive symptoms. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the adaptive value of rapid emotional recovery depends on one's baseline emotional state. Tracking emotion regulation dynamics of both positive and negative emotions may improve our ability to identify adolescents at risk for depression before symptoms emerge, thereby informing targeted intervention and prevention efforts.",

          "abstract": "Amid shifting patterns of market competition in Brazil, there is a growing trend among independent professionals, particularly clinical psychologists, to use social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube to promote their services. This report presents preliminary findings from an empirical study conducted by the LATRAPS Research Lab (UEMG, Brazil) aimed at examining the impacts of online counselling (mental health care) and social media content production on the health of clinical psychologists. The study employed mixed methods, with data collected between 2023 and 2024. The dataset comprises in-depth interviews with 10 clinical psychologists, along with a sociodemographic survey and the application of the Techno-Stress Scale (RED/TIC) to a sample of 170 Brazilian clinical psychologists. Key findings include the following: the majority of participants are women (84%), white (64%), aged 24–35 (60%), and childless (72%). Additionally, 50% are single, 65% hold a graduate degree (either lato or stricto sensu), and 61% undergraduated from private higher education universities. Regarding professional experience, 92% have been doing online counselling for less than five years, and 48% have at least two concurrent work affiliations. While 93% work as freelancers, 27% also hold a salaried position. Regarding mental health and work challenges, 32% reported cognitive and emotional exhaustion linked to the use of technology for clinical counselling. Additionally, 54% felt pressured by the productivity demands imposed by social media platforms. Among participants, 40% exhibited moderate levels of techno-stress, and 9% showed high levels. Within the dimensions of techno-stress, 32% demonstrated high levels of fatigue, and 20% reported significant anxiety related to the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). Among psychologists experiencing high levels of techno-stress, 93% are women, 73% felt pressured by the productivity logic of platforms, and 53% maintained two or more concurrent work affiliations. Furthermore, 40% struggled to disconnect from work, yet only 13% rated their emotional health for remote work as \"poor\" or \"very poor.\" This suggests that techno-stress often goes unrecognized by professionals in the short term. This study highlights the urgent need for a critical examination of how digitalization and platformization influence the well-being of clinical psychologists, offering valuable insights for future interventions and policy development.",

In each study, we manipulated (between-person) whether participants thought about intergroup conflict before completing a dictator game in which we manipulated (within-person) whether participants thought about God’s preferences when allocating real money to an outgroup member. Although participants who reflected on intergroup conflict gave less money away to outgroup members, thinking about God led to significant and comparable increases in intergroup prosociality regardless of whether participants thought about conflict. Results challenge widely held assumptions about the role of religious belief in intergroup conflict and raise questions about mechanisms that are often theorized to explain the spread of religious beliefs themselves.",

          "abstract": "Implementing existing green digital technology at scale could lead to a 20% reduction in global emissions annually. However, climate change has become a central focus of the \"culture wars\" providing a significant hindrance to the adoption of this technology. Using two survey experiments (total N = 2,089), we show that there is substantial heterogeneity in purchasing intentions when the same pro-environmental product is called \"smart\" or \"green.\" Environmental concern serves as an important moderator, with participants low in environmental concern showing a substantial aversion to green branding. We consider the marketing actions available to firms in this polarized environment and suggest that ideological sorting reduces the burden of targeting. We demonstrate that political party, an easily observable or inferred characteristic, provides a clean market segmentation correlating highly with environmental concern while capturing additional variation in the efficacy of green branding. Using simulations of multiple targeting schemes corresponding to different levels of sophistication and data access, we estimate that showing consumers the branding that aligns best with their political affiliation can increase purchasing intentions by 4%, performing just as well as a causal machine learning targeting approach. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that a 4% increase in purchasing intentions for just the five products tested here would reduce carbon emissions by approximately 1.2 gigatons by 2050, the equivalent of 5.4 million flights from London to New York City.",

          "abstract": "The digital revolution heralds the advent of the “écran global” era. The transformation of media has led to the miniaturization of screens and films (or videos). The micro-videos have emerged as one of the predominant forms of contemporary audiovisual expression. The key characteristics of traditional cinema have been redefined, leading to a “relocation” of the cinematic experience—reactivated and reproposed elsewhere than the place in which it was formed, with alternate devices (such as mobile digital apparatuses) and in new environments (such as the peripersonal space). This new form of experience is characterized by two distinct features. Firstly, the micro-videos, by virtue of being presented within peripersonal space, become within-reach. Secondly, the micro-videos, displayed on touchscreens, permit a dual haptic experience. On this basis, a new metaphor regarding screens is proposed—the “skin-screen”. The trajectory of the cinematic experience traces a multi-directional “topography of post-cinema”, aiming to provide a clearer delineation of the “state of post-cinema” and to facilitate more pertinent philosophical reflection.",

The insufficiency of mental health infrastructure, which is driving these problems, is even more pronounced in developing countries.

In this perspective, we argue for a possible utility of social media (SM) derived data combined with natural language processing (NLP) for the monitoring of individual-level mental health on a global scale. Using psychosis-spectrum disorders (PSD) as an example, we demonstrate how freely expressed speech can be processed automatically to predict and classify PSD with high levels of accuracy. We further outline the current state of PSD classification from SM-derived data and discuss methodological considerations that are hampering progress in this field. Finally, we delve into potential pitfalls of such systems and provide insight into how these may be navigated.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the varying effects of potential losses compared to gains on reflective thinking and problem-solving performance. Building on prospect theory and previous studies, we hypothesized that individuals would engage in longer reflection when faced with potential losses compared to equivalent potential gains, and that this extended reflection would enhance problem-solving performance, particularly in more challenging tasks. Two experimental studies were conducted. Study 1 established that participants reflected longer in tasks designed to avoid monetary losses than to achieve gains, confirming the hypothesis regarding prolonged reflection. However, this increased reflection did not translate into better performance across various tasks, suggesting that losses encourage persistence but do not inherently improve problem-solving efficacy. Study 2, which employed anagrams of varying difficulty, revealed that losses indeed correlated with longer reflection times but only improved performance in tasks deemed more difficult. These findings indicate that the effect of losses on reflection and performance is nuanced, highlighting the importance of task difficulty and the sensitivity of performance measures in understanding the interactions between loss aversion and cognitive processing. Overall, the results suggest that while losses prompt greater cognitive engagement, their influence on performance is contingent on task complexity, necessitating further exploration into the conditions under which losses enhance reflection and problem-solving capabilities.",

          "abstract": "Sexual harassment is highly prevalent, poses significant mental health challenges and profoundly affects professional and social functioning. Our broad goal was to study posttraumatic growth and the role of coping strategies in the context of sexual harassment experienced by Indian young adults, particularly investigating dysfunctional/avoidant coping styles and their contribution to posttraumatic growth, because of scarce extant data. We asked if dysfunctional/avoidant coping negatively mediates the positive effects of self-compassion and social support on posttraumatic growth employing a self-report online questionnaire and a cross sectional design. The sample consisted of 264 Indian young adults who completed validated measures of self-compassion, social support, coping, and posttraumatic growth. Hierarchical regression  analyses revealed that self-compassion and social support predicted posttraumatic growth and accounted for 31.2% of its variance. Coping and dysfunctional/avoidant coping accounted for an additional 16.4% of the variance in post-traumatic growth [ΔR² = 0.164, F(2, 259)= 41.0, p&lt;0.001], and combined, they accounted for 47.3% of the variance in post-traumatic growth. A mediation analysis showed that the relationship between self-compassion and posttraumatic growth was partially mediated by dysfunctional/avoidant coping [ꞵ=0.17441, z=4.293, p&lt;0.001] and the relationship between social support and posttraumatic growth was fully mediated by coping [ꞵ=0.24564, z=5.031, p&lt;0.001]. This finding expands and adds to the literature on posttraumatic growth in survivors of sexual harassment.",

Although commonly used by other social scientists, this tool remains largely unknown to psychologists. To address this issue, we offer a pedagogical primer tailored for this audience, complete with R, Stata, and SPSS scripts. This primer is organized into three parts. In PART 1, we show how fixed-effects modeling applies to clustered cross-sectional data. We introduce the concepts of ‘cluster dummies’ and ‘demeaning,’ and provide scripts to estimate the within-school association between sports and depression in a fictional dataset. In PART 2, we show how fixed-effects modeling applies to longitudinal data, and provide scripts to estimate the within-participant association between sports and depression over time in a fictional four-wave dataset. In this part, we cover three additional topics. First, we explain how to calculate effect sizes and offer simulation-based sample size guidelines to detect median-sized within-participant effects with sufficient power. Second, we show how to test two possible interactions: between a time-constant and a time-varying predictor and between two time-varying predictors. Third, we introduce three relevant extensions: first-difference modeling (estimating changes from one wave to the next); time-distributed fixed-effects modeling (estimating changes before, during, and after an individual event); and within-between multilevel modeling (estimating both within- and between-participant associations). In PART 3, we discuss two limitations of fixed-effects modeling: time-varying confounders and reverse causality. We conclude with reflections on causality in nonexperimental data.",

          "abstract": "This study explores how users perceive the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in various culinary scenarios. Using a hybrid model that combines Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling and a Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression Mixture Model, the research examines the influence of factors including the perceived accuracy of AI systems, general attitudes toward AI, and AI anxiety, on people’s trust in AI cooking applications—and how this trust, in turn, affects their intention to adopt such systems. Analysis of the data from 380 UK participants revealed two distinct consumer groups identified by the hybrid model: a small group of Engagers, who demonstrate openness to adopting AI-assisted cooking tools, and a much larger group of Avoiders, who refrain from using such technologies. Trust is shown to be a pivotal factor, with participants exhibiting higher trust levels (+ 1 SD) being 5.44 times more likely to be Engagers than Avoiders. However, adoption was found to be very much scenario-specific: AI is most readily accepted in cooking contexts that prioritize analytical and efficient solutions, such as using and combining leftover ingredients, but is less favoured in socially meaningful situations, such as hosting a dinner party. The results also reveal a demographic profile of those more open to AI cooking assistance, suggesting that younger, educated individuals are more likely to engage. This study contributes to understanding consumer dynamics in AI culinary applications, highlighting areas of opportunity for AI as a practical kitchen assistant and underscoring the challenges in achieving broad user trust.",

Using a state-of-the-art computational model to derive semantic transparency measures, we assessed the predictability of compound meanings from their constituents. Our regression model of experimental speech data revealed a notable duration difference between the first and second constituent and the third constituent for opaque compounds. For semantically transparent compounds, we find a shortening of the third constituent, diminishing the larger duration difference observed for less transparent compounds. These findings underscore the importance of semantic considerations in phonetic analyses of compound constituents, complementing prior research on morphological and phonological correlates of phonetic variation.",

          "abstract": "Social media presents both opportunities and risks to society. One risk includes the potential for the spread of disinformation, but methods for automatic detecting possible disinformation still mostly rely on low-level lexical cues. We present a new approach to the automatic detection of disinformation based on measuring discourse ‘derailment’ – messages that try to force the topic of discourse away from one topic and onto another. While this may include both malicious and benign derailment, it could serve as an important signal for early-warning systems. In this study, we implement a system for automatic detection of discourse derailment which uses a Large Language Model to generate expected replies and compares them to the real replies. We test this system on a set of human annotated data to show that the system outperforms various baselines and approaches the agreement between human annotators. This suggests that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be sensitive to discourse-level information. However, we also identify evidence of several limitations, including that the automatic system relies on different cues compared to human annotators, which leads to some amount of bias. Nevertheless, our project represents a considerable step towards understanding how to use LLMs to analyse discourse and a new angle on tackling disinformation.",

          "abstract": "The human visual system can recognise familiar forms, most notably faces, in other objects or patterns, a phenomenon known as pareidolia. The patterns that elicit pareidolia range from meaningful to ambiguous and random images, making it hard to generalise across the featural or configurational properties that trigger different types of pareidolia. Here, we aim to characterise the minimal stimuli associated with different types of pareidolia and investigate the extent to which pareidolia is tuned to variations in natural scene statistics and symmetry.  Participants in the current study viewed a range of synthetic noise patterns varying in their spatiotemporal spectral and symmetry characteristics and reported any shapes or structure perceived in these patterns. The patterns with spatiotemporal properties typical of natural scenes generated the highest number of responses with more animate, rather than inanimate, forms overall. While faces were the most reported animacy-related percept, responses covered a wide range of animate agents including animals and mythical creatures. The greatest number and the highest proportion of animacy-related percepts were observed in vertically symmetrical patterns compared to other types of pattern symmetry. Together, the current study establishes that pareidolia is tuned to natural scene statistics and biased towards animate forms, especially in patterns with vertical symmetry. It also demonstrates the usefulness of synthetic noise stimuli for pareidolia research.",

However, typical designs offer little information the immediate shape of affective responses following daily stressors, including the influence of situational and person-level variables. In a combined clinical and community sample (N=248; recruited between 2016 and 2018), we employed a high-density intensive-longitudinal protocol (observations N=1442) to capture the temporal dynamics of affect in response to daily stressful events using a microburst design. Specifically, we implemented an adaptive signal-contingent schedule, where an initial stressor report triggered an intense burst of prompts in 15-minute increments over the course of one hour inquiring about momentary affect. To model affective microtrajectories, we used multilevel structural equation modeling. A piecewise linear model consistently showed the best fit across all indices for both negative and positive affect. Affective responses to momentarily experienced stressors were best captured by a model that allowed for changes in affect trajectories over time (an initial steep decline/increase followed by gradual change), with more stressful situations amplifying these trajectories. Moreover, Extraversion significantly influenced the initial rise in positive affect, leading to more pronounced early changes in those with higher levels of Extraversion. In contrast, Neuroticism had an opposite effect on positive affect, dampening these early changes. Results offer a detailed understanding of daily stress dynamics by providing insights into the immediate and evolving nature of affective responses to stress, with implications for personalized stress management strategies.",

          "abstract": "Mastering prosody is a different task for adults learning a second language and infants acquiring their first. While prosody crucially aids the process of L1 acquisition, for adult L2 learners it is often considerably challenging. Is it because of an age-related decline of the language-learning ability or because of unfavourable learning conditions? We investigated whether adults can auditorily sensitise to the prosody of a novel language, and whether such sensitisation is affected by orthographic input. After 5 minutes of exposure to Māori, Czech listeners could reliably recognize this language in a post-test using low-pass filtered clips of Māori and Malay. Recognition accuracy was lower for participants exposed to the novel-language speech along with deep-orthography transcriptions or orthography with unfamiliar characters. Adults can thus attune to novel-language prosody, but orthography hampers this ability. Language-learning theories and applications may need to reconsider the consequences of providing orthographic input to beginning second-language learners.",

          "abstract": "How face perceptions unfold during ontogeny shapes how humans navigate adult social life. A vast literature implicates variation in sexually dimorphic facial characteristics in guiding judgments relating to suites of key life choices, ranging from partner choices to preferences for leaders. Although growing evidence supports that facial morphology underpins children’s first impressions from faces, whether these impressions influence children’s predictions about others’ behaviour remains unclear. We contrasted the influence of men’s facial hair, a highly sexually dimorphic masculine trait, on children’s explicit (Who looks strong/trustworthy) vs. implicit first impressions (Who do you want to tell your secret to/fight dragons?). While reading a storybook, children (N = 80; 4.5-12.0 years) and adults (N = 134), selected one of two twins (two images of the same identity, one bearded and one clean-shaven) to help them face a challenge requiring either a trustworthy or a dominant social partner. In control tasks, participants selected the strongest and most trustworthy member of each pair and then pointed to which face regions informed their decision. In the implicit task, both the probability of selecting a bearded partner and differential selection of bearded partners as a function of relevant trait increased with age. Selections in the explicit task were more adult-like and age-related changes in which facial cues participants used was surprisingly small. Thus, adult-like patterns in predicting other’s behaviour based on facial cues to trustworthiness and dominance lag behind adult-like patterns in inferring traits based on facial cues, potentially because first impressions are of unreliable.",

We tested a downward extension of the Climate Change Anxiety Scale (CCAS) in U.S. adolescents (n = 138) ages 13-17. Pre-registered four-, two-, and one-factor confirmatory analyses models were conducted, none of which met pre-registered fit criteria. Exploratory factor analyses revealed that items reliant on metacognition loaded poorly, and items that mixed emotional and cognitive/behavioral content cross-loaded. Dropping these items resulted in a three-factor model that fit the data adequately. Identified factors included impairment, experience with climate change, and behavioral engagement. The modified CCAS positively correlated with depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and heightened negative emotions about climate change.

          "abstract": "Suicide is a pressing global health issue, with alarming prevalence rates that have led\nthe World Health Organization to prioritize its prevention. Traditionally, suicidality is framed\nwithin medicine as a delusional symptom of mental illness. Contrastingly, another perspective\nviews suicide as an expression of free will, emphasizing the legitimacy of its motivations.\nThis paper seeks to reconcile these viewpoints by proposing that suicidality reflects a\nprofound rejection of life in its current form. Rather than endorsing the irreversible act of\nbiological suicide, this perspective suggests the true target of rejection is the individual's\nsocio-cultural existence and self-concept. Suicide, therefore, is a practical mistake, rooted in\nthe error of overly identifying with one's historical and socio-cultural circumstances.\nRecognizing this, health professionals might better support individuals by taking their desire\nfor transformation seriously—helping them redefine and rebuild their lives rather than merely\nattempting to treat suicidality as a delusional symptom. If it is actually only this socio-\ncultural life that an individual wishes to end, then the focus should be on addressing that\nwish.",

We question this assumption. We investigate consistency within individuals between its three forms—overestimation, overplacement, and overprecision— in multiple domains (Study 1a and 1b), at multiple times (Study 1b and 2), and with multiple measures (Study 3a and 3b). We find mixed evidence that does little to bolster claims that overconfidence qualifies as a trait. On the one hand, we do find some evidence of within-individual stability across domains and time points; on the other hand, we find little consistency across different measures of the same form of overconfidence. Instead, we find more consistent evidence that overconfidence varies situationally and contextually.",

But does endorsement of IB in principle translate to more uniform concern for others irrespective of relationship type?

Heightened concern for others in socially distant relationships was not “offset” by less concern for close ones; nor was IB associated with a motive to be generally admired but was instead linked to “communal striving.” Across different types of moral judgments, a commitment to IB thus entails caring much more than average about the well-being of socially distant others, while maintaining a high level of concern for socially close ones.",

          "authors": "Noel Danford Maturlu",
          "abstract": "This study explores the role of adversity and suffering, specifically operationalised as stress, in the relationship between spirituality and flourishing. The investigation focuses on both the mediating and moderating effects of stress in this context. The sample comprises 468 participants aged 17 to 34 years (mean age = 21.55, SD = 1.99), predominantly Christian (n = 314) and Muslim (n = 152). Gender distribution includes 213 females and 271 males. Most participants (n = 409) reported similarity to their religious group, with varied educational backgrounds for their parents and themselves. Descriptive statistics provided an overview of central tendencies and dispersions of the key variables. A correlation matrix assessed the relationships between spirituality, stress, and flourishing, revealing a weak but significant negative correlation between spirituality and stress, a weak but significant positive correlation between spirituality and flourishing, and a moderate, highly significant negative correlation between stress and flourishing.\nThe mediation analysis demonstrated that stress partially mediates the relationship between spirituality and flourishing. Higher levels of spirituality were associated with lower stress, which in turn was linked to higher flourishing. Moderation analysis indicated that stress does not significantly moderate the overall relationship between spirituality and flourishing. However, subgroup analysis showed a significant and positive interaction between spirituality and stress on flourishing in the high-spirituality, high-stress subgroup. This finding implies that for individuals with high spirituality, increased stress levels may enhance their sense of flourishing. These nuanced effects were further substantiated by 3D visualisation and robust bootstrapping estimates.\nThe results suggest that while spirituality generally reduces suffering and promotes flourishing, highly spiritual individuals might derive additional flourishing benefits under intense suffering. These insights have practical implications for integrating spiritual practices into stress management and therapeutic interventions, and they underscore the need for future research to explore these dynamics in diverse populations and longitudinal studies.",

This study investigates temporal binding within the context of preventive actions, where outcomes are avoided rather than produced. The experimental design was an adjusted form of intentional-binding paradigm, involved participants who were required to perform specific actions to prevent an aversive outcome cued by a neutral stimulus earlier. Results demonstrated that participants experienced a specific kind of temporal binding, “cue-binding”, as we named it. This suggests that temporal binding can occur not only in generative actions, but also in preventive actions aimed at avoiding undesirable effects.

          "authors": "Alexander A Sulfaro",
          "abstract": "Subjective ratings of a mental image’s vividness are frequently used to index the similarity between mental and real image phenomenology. However, what it means for a mental image to change in vividness, or to even be perceived at all, is not commonly understood in any concrete terms. Here, the impact of this uncertainty on the validity of vividness comparisons is assessed. Arguments are presented suggesting that vividness ratings cannot distinguish differences in mental image experience from differences in an individual’s self-defined criteria for what constitutes vivid mental imagery, undermining their validity as a tool for comparing the mental image experiences of different individuals. Further, this confound can similarly affect self-identified judgements about whether one experiences a mental image at all (i.e., aphantasia/phantasia). While confounds may affect between-individual comparisons, within-individual comparisons may still have some valid use cases, although they may be largely superseded by other metrics given their limited interpretability. Arguments are also discussed which suggest that vividness ratings and judgements cannot gain construct validity by being correlated with physiological processes until the quasi-sensory nature of mental images is defined. Overall, commonly used vividness ratings seem to be affected by foundational logical flaws which diminish their utility, sometimes entirely. Validly indexing a change in the quasi-visibility of a mental image may require a concerted effort to first define what it means to see a mental image at all, with self-report in general still playing an essential role in mental imagery research, provided it is cautiously interpreted.",

          "authors": "Sebastian Holt; David Barner",
          "abstract": "When children learn to count, they are exposed to a finite list of words, as well as rules for combining them - e.g., that any decade label, like “seventy” can be combined with the unit labels “one” through “nine”. Additive, multiplicative, and other rules allow the creation of indefinitely large numbers, beyond those that children experience directly in their input. However, while children begin to use number words by the age of 2, they generally don’t acquire rules for combining them until much later. One possible reason for this late learning of rules is that it exceeds the cognitive capacities of younger children, or depends on information acquired at earlier stages of learning. Another possibility, however, is that these rules are hard to learn because they’re not readily available in children’s input, and that other forms of input might lead to earlier learning. Here, we simulated the problem of number word learning in adult participants by training them on a series of artificial number “languages”. We find that (1) training adults on rote counting facilitates memory for number words, but (2) may actually inhibit the acquisition of rules that govern them. We also find that whereas additive rules are relatively easy to learn (e.g., the number after “twenty” is “twenty-one”), adults struggle to acquire new multiplicative rules (e.g., “seventy” is seven tens). Finally, we find that the size of a base - e.g., base 2 vs. base 5 - has little effect on learning when learned via a rote counting procedure, despite the fact that larger bases require more memorization of words, and provide less exposure to rules.",

This article extends this work by examining the connection between social feedback and language usage. Social feedback, operationalized here as the difference between the number of upvotes and downvotes on comments on the social media forum Reddit, provides a unique opportunity to investigate how social approval interacts with linguistic behavior. To accomplish this, social feedback ratings from over 400 billion words of comments from the social media forum Reddit were mined. Two types of corpora were formed: 1) large (approximately 1.7 billion words) combined corpora of positive, negative, and neutral comments, and 2) individual corpora from over 1,500 high-level commenters on Reddit (following recent work by Johns, 2021a, 2023, 2024a,b using individualized language models). Both were used to examine social feedback and language usage across multiple sets of lexical organization and lexical semantic data with distributional modeling techniques. It was found that comments that receive positive social feedback tended to align more closely with normative language usage, suggesting that the acceptability of a communicative message may lie in the form of that utterance and not just the content of it. Additionally, this trend was replicated at the individual level, where commenters who had more normative usage of language generally received more positive ratings on their comments.",

In this piece, we argue that measures of metacognitive sensitivity provided by AI systems will likely play a critical role in (1) helping individuals to calibrate their level of trust in these systems, and (2) optimally incorporate advice from AI into human-AI hybrid decision- making.

Study aims were to: (1) learn about participants’ experiences with and reasons for attending one-to-one TCTSY; (2) describe and compare participants’ experiences between group and one-to-one yoga settings; (3) explore participants’ perceptions of the impacts of TCTSY on their trauma healing; and (4) document participants’ intentions for continued one-to-one TCTSY use. Semistructured interviews were offered to participants at completion of a longitudinal observational study of one-to-one TCTSY; 4 of the 10 participants agreed to be interviewed.

Following the consensual qualitative research method, domains were initially created deductively by the team. Adjustments, as well as categories and core ideas, were created inductively. Results indicated that participants: (1) preferred one-to-one over groups because of perceived safety and comfort; (2) had positive experiences with TCTSY; (3) perceived biopsychosocial benefits from the practice and described using TCTSY principles outside of sessions; and (4) intended to practice indefinitely.

          "abstract": "Visual Working Memory (VWM) is crucial for temporarily holding and manipulating visual information but is limited in capacity, necessitating effective distractor filtering. Previous studies indicate differential effects of distractors appearing during encoding and delay stages, but how stimulus presentation duration influences these effects remains unclear. We conducted two experiments to investigate the role of stimulus presentation duration on VWM performance under different distraction conditions. In Experiment 1, participants performed continuous recall and change detection tasks for memorizing three target orientations under four conditions: no-distraction, encoding-distraction, full-distraction, and delay-distraction, with short (200 ms) and long (1000 ms) presentation durations. Experiment 2 extended these findings by examining the role of distractor-target similarity, introducing both same-category (orientation) and different-category (face) distractors. In Experiment 1, high-precision tasks showed impairment from both encoding- and delay-stage distractors during short durations, while only delay-stage distractors persisted with longer durations. For low-precision tasks, delay-stage distractors consistently impaired VWM performance, whereas encoding-stage distractions had a lesser effect. Experiment 2 revealed that short-duration delay-stage distractors impaired VWM regardless of type, while long-duration same-category distractors impaired performance during delay stages, and different-category distractors had a lesser effect. The results demonstrate that stimulus presentation duration critically modulates distractor impact. Longer durations enable more stable VWM consolidation, aiding in resisting delay-stage distractions, while homogeneous distractors remain more challenging to filter compared to heterogeneous distractors. This differential effect suggests that VWM filtering mechanisms are sensitive to both presentation duration and distractor-target similarity. Our findings highlight the importance of stimulus presentation duration in VWM distractor filtering and suggest that effective resistance to distractors depends on both consolidation time and distractor similarity. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the temporal dynamics and mechanisms underlying distractor processing in VWM.",

Here, we employ a novel task-driven resting-state electroencephalography design including an implicit Lindenmayer grammar learning task, which tracks aperiodic and hierarchical dependencies, to determine task-related functional connectivity changes in bilinguals. Quantified bilingual experience was used as a predictor of directional effects, using Generalised Additive Models to account for non-linear patterns. Our results revealed whole-brain post-task alterations to connectivity, including increased involvement of bilateral temporal and posterior regions and reduced involvement of frontal regions.

Primals fit to a hierarchical structure, e.g. the primary primal belief that the world is Good (vs. bad), and secondary primals; the beliefs the world is Safe (vs. dangerous), Enticing (vs. dull) and Alive (vs. mechanistic). Primals can be assessed empirically with self-report measures, appear stable over time, and are associated with wellbeing. There is currently no research investigating primals in psychosis-spectrum disorders (PSD). We aimed to investigate possible differences in primary and secondary primals between PSD and non-psychotic controls, and understand associations between primals and PSD-related experiences.\nStudy Design: This online, self-report, observational study included 99 participants (47 PSD, 53 non-PSD). Participants were screened for psychosis using the Prodromal Questionnaire-16 (PQ-16). PSD experiences were assessed with the Multi-Modality Unusual Sensory Experiences Questionnaire (MUSEQ) and Peters’ Delusion Inventory-21 (PDI). Primals were measured using the Primals Inventory (PI-18).\nStudy Results: Individuals with PSD reported more negative primals than controls. Beliefs the world is less Safe were associated with more psychotic symptoms, subjective distress about symptoms, and preoccupation with delusions. Context of delusions also mattered, whereby inflated-self and magical thinking were associated with more positive primals. Presence and frequency of hallucinations and delusional ideation were not associated with primals. \nConclusions: The role of primals at different stages of PSD is not clear; future research would benefit from longitudinal investigations to understand the potential role of primals in psychological interventions to reduce symptom-related distress.",

          "authors": "Pericle Raverta; Irene Sandi; Barbara Martin; Barbara Loera",
          "abstract": "The gradual emergence of cultivated meat (CM) products on the market framed as sustainable alternatives to conventional animal-source foods makes it essential to examine the psychological barriers and predisposing factors that influence consumer acceptance. Familiarity is frequently suggested as a facilitating factor, based on the premise that increased familiarity with CM enhances acceptance. However, the evidence is contradictory and poorly integrated. This review aims to examine and organize the existing literature on the role of familiarity in consumer acceptance of CM. \nA scoping review of current peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted, on June 7, 2024, following PRISMA-ScR and Joanna Briggs Institute methodological guidelines. A comprehensive search was performed across Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and PsycInfo, with no restrictions on participant type, geographic location, social and cultural contexts, language, or publication time, enhancing the review's inclusivity and sensitivity. The 63 articles that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed to examine (i) definitions of familiarity, (ii) methodologies used to measure familiarity with CM, and (iii) evidence obtained regarding its role in the context of consumer acceptance of CM. Results indicated that current research on familiarity with CM shares limitations with the broader literature on CM acceptance, particularly concerning the non-representativeness of evidence and inconsistent approaches to constructs' operationalization. Furthermore, familiarity is often used synonymously with related yet distinct constructs of awareness and knowledge, highlighting a lack of clarity in literature. The review also identified various approaches to assess familiarity, all lacking psychometric rigor, which hinder the replicability and comparability of findings. By unfolding the methodologies and evidence surrounding familiarity with CM, this review suggests further research to better specify the theoretical and operational definition of the familiarity construct and its relation with consumer acceptance of CM.",

We conducted two preregistered experimental studies, examining how endorsements (likes) from individuals with similar or opposing political views affected truth judgments and the willingness to like and share neutral and partisan content. For politically neutral content (Study 1), the perceived truthfulness increased with a higher proportion of likes. However, for partisan content (Study 2), the perceived truthfulness remained unchanged by the proportion of likes but was higher for content aligning with the participants' political views. Strikingly, across both studies, the tendency to like and share content – whether neutral or partisan – increased with the proportion of likes and the political alignment of the endorsers. Our findings reveal how social factors can both enhance and limit the influence of social endorsements on truth judgments and online behavior.",

          "abstract": "The term “afterglow“ was first used to describe the heightened mood, relaxation, and overall sense of tranquility reported by individuals hours or even days after the use of psychedelics, after their most immediate effects had dissipated. The use of the word “afterglow” was then extended to similar states achieved after other altered-state experiences. Even though the afterglow effect is widely reported anecdotally, not much quantitative research has been undertaken on it and none at all explicitly related to Floatation-REST (Reduced Environmental Stimulation Technique). In Floatation-REST an individual floats almost weightlessly on the surface of thermoneutral, supersaturated salt water in a quiet, dark tank. Using a within-subject crossover design, 34 healthy subjects were randomized to 60 min of Floatation-REST or 60 min of Bed-REST, a control condition where one lies supine on a waterbed in a dark, quiet room. We assessed the experience during the REST conditions as well as regarding the alleged afterglow effect following a 10-minute period of silence after exposure to the conditions. Floatation-REST led to weaker body boundaries, stronger time distortion, and more relaxation, as experienced during the conditions. After Floatation-REST exposure, individuals reported a stronger feeling of afterglow as measured with an afterglow inventory, more state mindfulness, and more interoceptive awareness. A mediation analysis revealed that the relaxation experienced during Floatation-REST completely mediates the afterglow effect: The feeling of afterglow follows from a specific increase in relaxation during floating. Our findings support prior research on psychedelics by showing that Floatation-REST produces qualitatively similar effects. This very first study sets the ground for future studies on the afterglow effect for longer time increments after altered-state experiences.",

We performed this analysis by applying a general additive mixed regression model (GAMM) to reveal intricate, non-linear interaction effects, especially those of the three linguistic distance measures we applied, and, more in particular, to map the changing role of morphological distance in relation to lexical and phonological distance. All three distances contributed in explaining L2 English country scores: the larger the distance is the lower L2 English proficiency. Morphological distance delivers its own, distinctive contribution, next to and in competition with the lexical and phonological distances. All three distances interact with year of testing. These changes seem to reflect the increasing presence and dominance of L2 English worldwide, but it shows at the same time that the impact of distance is dynamic. Morphological and phonological properties become more important the higher the L2 proficiency is, while the importance of lexical distance gradually decreases.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Buttlar; Anna Lambrich; Linda McCaughey; Iris K. Schneider",
          "abstract": "People regularly have to navigate decisions in which they feel ambivalent, for instance, regarding unhealthy food, recycling, or financial investments. It is assumed that people cope with such felt ambivalence by seeking information that sway their ambivalent attitudes about these topics. However, empirical evidence for this proposition is scarce because most study measure information seeking intentions instead of behavior. As such, it remains doubtful whether information seeking indeed helps people to reduce felt ambivalence while making decisions. To test this proposition, we adapted a sample-based information seeking paradigm that enabled us to measure actual information seeking behavior in financial decisions. In three pre-registered studies (total N = 365 participants; k = 10.519 decisions), we demonstrated that when people feel ambivalent about an initial set of information about a stock, they seek more information about its development to decide whether it develops positively or negatively; this information seeking, in turn, helps them to reduce felt ambivalence when making the decision. This supports a central proposition in ambivalence research, indicating that people can indeed solve their felt ambivalence through information seeking. However, our data also showed that the effect of information seeking on felt ambivalence did not depend on whether the sought information was actually able to resolve the attitudinal basis of the conflict. Future research should, therefore, examine whether and how information seeking as a problem-focused coping strategy may also impact attitude strength more generally, and whether information seeking can serve as an emotion-focused coping strategy to reduce conflict-induced discomfort.",

Using context-driven picture naming, we examined whether (a) speakers preplan lexical-semantic and phonological information at the word level in constraining sentential contexts, and (b) phonological preplanning encompasses the whole word. Analysis of naming response times (RTs) showed that constraining contexts enable preplanning of both lexical-semantic and phonological representations (Experiment 1). Using a picture-word interference version of the same task (Experiment 2), we found that speakers preplan the phonological form of the whole word, however, only the subset of constraining trials with the shortest RTs indicated preplanning. The results confirm previous findings from turn-taking, which suggested that speakers can complete later stages of lexical access in advance, but also highlight that the presence of preplanning varies from trial to trial.",

          "abstract": "Response Surface Analysis (RSA) allows researchers to study whether the degree of congruence between two predictor variables is related to a potential psychological outcome. Here, we adapt RSA to the case in which the two predictor variables whose  congruence is of interest refer to individual differences in within-person associations (WPAs) between variables that fluctuate over time. For example, a WPA-congruence hypothesis in research on romantic relationships could posit that partners are happier when they have similar social reactivities – that is, when they have similarly strong WPAs between the quantity of their social interactions and their momentary well-being. One method for testing a WPA-congruence hypothesis is a 2-step approach in which the individuals' WPAs are first estimated as random slopes in respective multilevel models, and then these estimates are used as predictors in a regular RSA. As an alternative, we suggest combining RSA with multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) by specifying the WPAs as random slopes in the structural equation and using their latent second-order terms to predict the outcome on Level 2. We introduce both approaches and provide and explain their corresponding computer code templates. We also compared the two approaches with a simulation study and found that the MSEM model – despite its complexities (e.g., nonlinear functions of latent slopes) – has advantages over the 2-step approach. We conclude that the MSEM approach should be used in practice. We demonstrate its application using data from a daily diary study and offer guidance for important decisions (e.g., about standardization).",

          "abstract": "Background: Imagery rescripting (ImRs) and imaginal exposure (IE) are both effective for treating distressing memories. ImRs is thought to promote mastery and positive memory revaluation, while emotion tolerance is seen as a key factor in exposure models. This study investigated emotional responses and PTSD analogue symptoms in an analogue design and explored mastery and emotion tolerance as potential mediators. \nMethods: 154 participants (46.8% male) selected a distressing autobiographical event and received a brief analogue of ImRs or IE, delivered via pre-recorded audio instructions, or a control condition. Emotional responses, distress, PTSD analogue symptoms, sense of mastery and emotion tolerance were assessed before and after memory reactivation and post-intervention. \nResults: Mixed-effects analysis indicated unique positive changes in self-conscious and positive emotions as well as sense of mastery following ImRs – but only in males, whereas females improved across all conditions. In contrast, IE led to significantly different increases in anger and memory distress. Changes in fear, distress, PTSD analogue symptoms and emotion tolerance did not differ across conditions. Multiple parallel mediation analyses yielded that mastery, but not tolerance, mediated positive emotional shifts in ImRs. There was no evidence to support emotion tolerance as a mechanism of change in IE. \nConclusion: Our results cautiously support the hypothesis that ImRs leads to positive memory revaluation but not that emotion tolerance mediates changes in IE. We discuss possible explanations for the gender differences and point out shortcomings in procedure and measurement that may explain the unexpected findings in IE.",

These tests were given to five instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) to examine the capabilities of LLMs to contribute to teamwork. Our results revealed concrete strengths and shortcomings of LLMs to engage in teaming behaviours. Language models performed well on action phases of teamwork, where a team engages in specific work tasks such as monitoring and coordination to meet team goals. In contrast, LLMs lacked the abstract reasoning and planning required to meet transition phases of teamwork. These moments are critical for self-reflection of past performance and planning for upcoming tasks in teams. Finally, LLMs had unique behaviours for interpersonal aspects of teamwork, predominately applying an integrating motivational style but failing to acknowledge negative emotional states of teammates. These findings reveal how ‘off-the-shelf’ LLMs may contribute to contemporary human-AI teams and highlight the utility of experimental psychology in elucidating behaviours of non-embodied agents.",

Other effects of exposure to conspiracy information were mixed. In Study 1, reading about an agricultural biotechnology conspiracy had a small significant effect on reducing intentions to eat Genetically Modified food. In Study 2, exposure to a conspiracy involving biobank scientists decreased support for biobanks, mediated by decreased trust in biobank scientists. In Study 3, this conspiracy had no effect on wider beliefs of the role of science in society (science populism), nor support of Genetically Modified food-promoting policies. Overall, we found that exposure to conspiracies involving scientific claims increased conspiracy belief endorsement and can further negative effects.

          "abstract": "What characteristics make a person a formidable competitor or a threatening rival? Regardless of the realm of competition, a rival’s perceived level of competitive threat should comprise both rival willingness and ability to compete for a mutually desired outcome. We apply this logic to heterosexual women’s intrasexual mating competition, where women compete for male mates primarily in the domains of sexual accessibility and physical attractiveness—characteristics men value in female partners. Specifically, we leverage a basic task analysis to identify two central components driving perceptions of women’s mating threat: their competitive intent (i.e., willingness to compete for mates, cued by mate-seeking behavior) and their competitive capacity (i.e., ability to attract mates, cued by physical attractiveness). We predicted that a) mate-seeking behavior (e.g., flirting) would drive perceptions of women’s competitive intent, while b) physical attractiveness would drive perceptions of women’s competitive capacity. However, some behavior (e.g., wearing revealing clothing) can impact perceptions of women’s mate-seeking behavior and attractiveness, simultaneously shaping perceptions of women’s competitive intent and capacity (and thus competitive threat). As such, we further predicted that c) appearance enhancement drives perceptions of target women’s mating threat via multiple routes. We find support for these predictions across three experiments with U.S. college students (N=1169), a demographic engaged in high mating competition. Across studies, we also explored how women's perceived competitive intent and capacity affect women targets’ potential social outcomes, including being targeted for intrasexual aggression, and opportunities for intrasexual friendships. Findings provide a framework to guide future work on women’s sociality.",

          "abstract": "This study compared the size weight illusion (SWI) and object lifting kinematics between physical and virtual conditions, shedding light on the nuanced disparities in perception and action across different environmental mediums. We examined whether prior expectations about object weight based on size cues, which affect the experience of real-world object interactions, are different in virtual reality (VR). Employing a highly realistic virtual environment with precisely-matched visual size and haptic cues, we tested the hypothesis that VR, which may be experienced as uncertain, unfamiliar, or unpredictable, would induce a smaller SWI due to a diminished effect of prior expectations. Participants (N=25) reported the felt heaviness of lifted objects that varied in both volume and mass in physical reality and a VR environment. Reach and lift kinematics, and self-reported presence, were also recorded. Our findings showed no differences between how participants perceived the SWI between real and virtual environments, although there was a trend towards a smaller illusion in VR. Contrary to our predictions, participants who experienced more presence in VR did not experience a larger SWI, but the inverse relationship was observed. Notably, differences in reach velocities between physical and virtual conditions suggested a more controlled approach in VR. These findings highlight the intricate relationship between immersion and sensorimotor processes in virtual environments, emphasising the need for deeper exploration into the underlying mechanisms that shape human interactions with immersive technologies, particularly the prior expectations associated with virtual environments.",

          "abstract": "Remembering the unfolding of past episodes usually takes less time than their actual duration. Recent work measuring the time required to mentally replay videos suggests that such temporal compression emerges when continuous events become too long to be fully held in working memory. However, in this previous research, the time needed to initiate the mental replay (i.e., to mentally visualize the starting point of events) was not taken into account. In the current study, we developed a corrected measure of remembering duration that controls for this initiation time to better characterize working memory capacity in representing continuous event. Using this corrected measure, we assessed the time needed by participants to mentally replay videos depicting continuous events (e.g., turning a car jack) lasting 3, 6, 9, 12, or 15 s. The results showed  that events longer that 3-s were remembered in less time than their actual duration, suggesting  that working memory is limited in its capacity to represent continuous events, leading to the emergence of temporal compression when they exceed 3 s. Exploratory analyses further revealed that faster mental replay tended to be judged less dynamic but not less clear, suggesting that the temporal compression of continuous events likely results from an incomplete remembering of event’s unfolding rather than a complete but imprecise mental replay.",

          "abstract": "The shape and texture of humans and humanoid robots provide perceptual information that help us to appropriately categorise these stimuli. However, it remains unclear which features and attributes are driving the assignment into human and non-human categories. To explore this issue, we ran a series of five preregistered experiments wherein we presented stimuli that varied in their appearance (i.e., humans, humanoid robots, non-human primates, mannequins, hammers, musical instruments) and asked participants to complete a match-to-category task (Experiments 1-2-3), a priming task (Experiment 4), or to rate each category along four dimensions (i.e., similarity, liveliness, body association, action association; Experiment 5). Results indicate that categorising human bodies and humanoid robots requires the integration of both the analyses of their physical shape and visual texture (i.e., to identify a humanoid robot we cannot only rely on its visual shape). Further, our behavioural findings suggest that human bodies may be represented as a special living category separate from non-human animal entities (i.e., primates). Moreover, results also suggest that categorising humans and humanoid robots may rely on a network of information typically associated to human being and inanimate objects respectively (e.g., humans can play musical instruments and have a mind while robots do not play musical instruments and do have not a human mind). Overall, the paradigms introduced here offer new avenues through which to study the perception of human and artificial agents, and how experiences with humanoid robots may change the perception of humanness along a robot—human continuum.",

A non-probabilistic, snowball sample of 335 Peruvian adults was taken. For content validity, the clarity of the items were evaluated using Aiken's V. For internal structure validity, the fit indices of a series of confirmatory factor analyzes were evaluated for the one, two, and three-factor models. For validity with respect to other constructs, the SD-R constructs were correlated with the purity/sanctity subconstruct of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire. For reliability, the ordinal alpha and the omega coefficient were used. Acceptable fit indices were obtained for the two and three oblique factor models, acceptable reliability indices for the core disgust and animal reminder scales was obtained, and small and significant positive correlations were obtained between the contamination and animal reminder factors with the purity/sanctity scale of the MFQ. The DS-R is an instrument with acceptable psychometric properties, although some adjustments must be made related to the reliability of the contamination scale, added to the exploration of other variables that correlate to each of its constructs to obtain greater validity in relation to other variables.",

          "abstract": "Dreams are theorized to enhance evolutionary relevant skills such as coping with threats or social situations. At the same time, most dreams are forgotten rapidly. Here we discuss how this paradox of skill learning during dreams despite subsequent dream amnesia can be dissolved with reference to different memory systems. On the one hand, dream amnesia affects explicit declarative memories of dream episodes to avoid dream-reality confusion. The acquisition and training of threat coping and social skills during dreaming, on the other hand, are not affected, as these non-declarative learning experiences rely on implicit memory systems. We quickly forget the potentially confusing explicit content of our nocturnal training lessons; however, we retain their implicit practical insights to shape our daytime skills in recognizing and coping with threatening or social situations.",

Identification of biomarkers prospectively associated with PTSD can provide critical insight into the mechanisms underpinning this disorder and potentially aid in identifying CYP vulnerable to persistent symptoms. \n\nA systematic search of databases was conducted up until February 2024 to identify studies testing associations of prospective biomarkers with PTSD outcomes in CYP.

Twenty-one studies met eligibility criteria in the following biological domains: hormonal, immunological, cardiovascular, and multisystem. The majority of studies focussed on naturalistic recovery of CYP exposed to acute trauma. Significant heterogeneity was observed, including in trauma type, selection, and biomarker measurement. Across biomarkers, strong evidence was observed for a prospective association between elevated heartrate post-trauma and increased risk of PTSD persistence only, with limited evidence in other domains. \n\nOur review highlights a limited evidence base for prospective biomarkers of the development of PTSD in CYP, with methodological issues limiting inferences that can be drawn. A notable lack of evidence from lower-and-middle income countries, despite chronic and severe trauma being endemic in these settings, was identified.

          "authors": "Víthor Rosa Franco",
          "abstract": "This paper proposes the experimental psychometrics framework, an approach that integrates causal inference and experimental design, representational measurement theory, and data theory to enhance psychological measurement. The framework addresses limitations of traditional psychometric methods by emphasizing the need for experimental control to account for sources of systematic error and to test the assumptions underlying psychometric models. It is argued that past propositions found in the literature have demonstrated how experimental manipulation can improve the validity of measures and provide better tests of theoretical expectations. However, the application of experimental manipulation and causal modeling as tool for assessing the abstract structure of the data, that can be tested from a representational measurement theory perspective are not well developed. Two empirical examples are presented to illustrate how the experimental psychometrics framework offers a structured approach for deriving more robust and replicable measurements. This work contributes to the growing discourse on improving the rigor of psychological measurement and theory, advocating for a more experimentally-driven and theory-informed approach. The potential for this framework to reshape psychometric practices is significant, promising to enhance the accuracy, validity, and reliability of psychological assessments.",

          "authors": "Richard Brown; Claire Naomi Murphy-Morgan; James Downs; Dawn Branley-Bell",
          "abstract": "There are growing calls for a comprehensive, evidence-based national eating disorder strategy. This is due to the rising prevalence of eating disorders (EDs) in England, the lack of national guidance in relation to different ED presentations (and potentially varying treatment needs), ad hoc data collection, and inconsistencies in both care and evaluation of quality-of-service provision. Furthermore, the shift towards the remote delivery of care during the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need for government strategy to include specific guidance on remote delivery of ED services. The increased use of remote healthcare presents an opportunity to mitigate regional disparities in the provision of care. However, there are distinct challenges when delivering ED services remotely. In this position paper, we firstly highlight the growing need for a comprehensive national ED strategy for England to combat the rising prevalence and harm of EDs. Secondly, we specify the importance of ensuring that future governmental strategy incorporates evidence-based guidelines specific to remote delivery of ED services. This is crucial for promoting consistent provision of ED care. We set out the lack of comprehensive national data, and the need for further research into remote delivery of care. Finally, we provide recent research findings from the RHED-C project (Remote Healthcare for Eating Disorders throughout COVID-19) that present recommendations aimed at enhancing future service delivery for remote treatment and support.",

Educational interventions effectively improved students’ moral outcomes of sensitivity, judgment, motivation, and character compared to control groups (g = 0.54; n = 45; k = 133). Interventions involving student discussions were more effective than those relying solely on unidirectional or passive transfer of information.

          "authors": "Paul Hill; Skyelynn Bermudez; Joshua D Garren; Andrew S McAvan; Jingyi Zheng; Carol A Barnes; Arne Ekstrom",
          "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that older adults perform worse than do younger individuals in spatial navigation tasks, though the reasons for these age differences remain unclear. One hypothesis is that aging leads to a specific deficit in allocentric navigation, which is often assessed by examining how well participants can remember the spatial location of objects in relation to external landmarks within the environment. To test this hypothesis, we had young and older adults navigate a virtual environment under two conditions: a desktop setup using a keyboard and mouse to navigate, and an immersive virtual reality setup that allowed unrestricted ambulation. Both age groups performed worse when recalling locations from novel compared to familiar start locations - often taken as a hallmark of allocentric navigation - though the costs of switching from familiar to novel locations did not significantly differ between the two age groups. Older adults also employed distal landmarks to a comparable extent as did young adults in all conditions. Older adults were more likely to replicate previously taken paths, possibly indicating a preference for egocentric or route-based strategies. This effect was significantly attenuated in the immersive VR condition, particularly in the presence of geometric boundary cues. Age differences in spatial navigation may therefore be driven in part by a selective bias for navigating familiar routes, though these differences appear to be mitigated in the presence of multimodal visual and sensorimotor cues. By contrast, we did not identify any evidence to suggest that spatial errors in older age stem from a failure to attend to stable landmarks within the environment. These results suggest that age differences in navigation are influenced by multiple factors that cannot be reduced to a simple allocentric-egocentric dichotomy.",

          "abstract": "Reinforcement-driven learning involves processing feedback signals to optimize future actions and decision making. This feedback can be discrete, occurring as a separate event from action or anticipation, or continuous, occurring constantly and concurrently with ongoing decision-making. Despite the real-world relevance of continuous feedback, most research paradigms investigate feedback processing as a discrete process. To address this, we analyzed fMRI data from four neurofeedback studies in which participants engaged in continuous feedback learning. Neural responses to the most positive, most negative, and the weakest feedback signals were compared. Our results show that nucleus accumbens activity tracked with feedback valence, and specifically, was greater in response to success than to failure during neurofeedback. Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), hippocampus, supplementary motor area (SMA) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) were more activated in response to weak feedback than to strong feedback. Our findings suggest that during continuous feedback learning, weak feedback (more than strong feedback) increases activity in brain regions previously implicated in self referential thinking, decision-making under uncertainty, and referencing past experiences. These data suggest the ambiguity inherent in weak feedback may result in engagement of these processes to support context-dependent interpretations of the feedback signals.",

          "abstract": "Knowledge organizes our understanding of the world, determining what we expect given what we have already seen. Our predictive representations have two key properties: they are productive, and they are graded. Productive generalization is possible because our knowledge decomposes into concepts -- elements of knowledge that are combined and recombined to describe particular situations. Gradedness is the observable effect of accounting for uncertainty -- our knowledge encodes degrees of belief that lead to graded probabilistic predictions. To put this a different way, concepts form a combinatorial system that enables description of many different situations; each such situation specifies a distribution over what we expect to see in the world, given what we have seen. We may think of this system as a probabilistic language of thought (PLoT), in which representations are built from language-like composition of concepts, and the content of those representations is a probability distribution on world states. The purpose of this chapter is to formalize these ideas in computational terms, to illustrate key properties of the PLoT approach with a concrete example, and to draw connections with other views of conceptual structure.",

          "authors": "Sophie Ma Zhu; David Budescu; Nikolay Petrov; Ezra Karger; Mark Himmelstein",
          "abstract": "Forecasting tournaments are a well established method for assessing human forecasting skills. Most forecasting tournaments are based on a format where participants estimate the probabilities of discrete events. For predictions of continuous values, the possible range of outcome values is divided into mutually exclusive bins covering the entire outcome distribution so that probabilities for each bin can be elicited. An alternative approach involves directly eliciting forecasts about quantiles of the continuous quantity. Using both simulated data and data from 1,147 participants who completed five surveys focused on forecasting tasks in a longitudinal study, we compared the psychometric properties of quantile and probability elicitation methods. In the simulation, we demonstrated that items in the quantile format recovered parameters that defined forecasters’ latent forecasting skill in fewer items than the probability format, and identified several idiosyncrasies in accuracy scores for the probability format that drive these differences. In the empirical analyses, we elicited forecasts about a set of 36 forecasting questions in both formats: quantile forecasts at five fixed probability values (5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 95%) and probability forecasts for five pre-determined item-specific bins. Consistent with the simulated results, our findings revealed that forecasts in the quantile format showed considerably stronger internal consistency, achieving a suitable reliability level with fewer items. When cross-validating how well individual forecasters’ accuracy on in-sample questions predicted their performance in out-of-sample questions, the variability in the accuracy of quantile forecasts was more statistically explainable. Despite its desirable properties, errors and signs of comprehension difficulties were more frequently observed in the quantile format. Further research is needed to refine elicitations that optimize the effectiveness of quantile-based forecasting judgments.",

Because both aspects of behavior presumably reflect aberrant cerebral function, the highest-order latent variable in such a model would be the “c” (for cerebral) factor. We estimated a tri-factor model of “c” in N=9,494 children and young adults from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort using the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery and the GOASSESS clinical interview. We tested the validity of factor scores resulting from this model by relating them to external criteria, including global functioning, parent education, socioeconomic status, intracranial volume, and longitudinal clinical outcome. Fit of the structural model was acceptable (CFI = 0.98; SRMR = 0.030), and scores correlated with external criteria as expected (functioning = 0.27; parent education = 0.43; socioeconomic status = 0.47; intracranial volume = 0.39; clinical outcome Cohen d = 0.30 and 0.57). For most criteria, the effect for the “c” factor was larger than either the “p” or “g” factors alone. These results provide evidence for the feasibility and potential utility of modeling the “c” factor when cognitive and clinical data are both available.",

Results: We found that young people who experienced school exclusion had significantly worse scores at age 14 on all of these outcomes. The use of propensity score matching (including matching on prior behavioural problems) strengthens confidence in the idea that the effects are causal. Conclusions: Results point to the need for policies oriented towards reducing school exclusions and ensuring mitigating measures are in place to minimise its impact on those who experience it.",

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) performance declines across the lifespan, partly due to greater vulnerability to environmental distraction. WM requires resistance to distractors, which may enter WM due to ineffective filtering during simultaneous presentation with targets, as in a spatial array during WM encoding. Alternatively, distractors may enter WM due to insufficient ability to ignore them when they are presented during WM maintenance. Current research disagrees about whether a deficit in distractor suppression accounts for older adults’ impaired WM performance, or not. Beyond these differing perspectives, it is unclear whether WM performance is vulnerable to different types of distractors, including those that are novel versus familiar, or high versus low saliency. Across three behavioral experiments we found that participants were more vulnerable to distractors presented during encoding than those presented during maintenance, with stronger effects in older adults. Distractor familiarity and saliency had minimal impact on WM performance, and patterns of results did not change across trials. Rather than providing converging evidence these data expand the pattern of distractor-related WM deficits observed in older adults.",

          "abstract": "Everyday decision-making often involves choosing between multiple alternatives, and establishing unified theories for this process would benefit broad disciplines of behavioral science. A key challenge lies in explaining behavioral irrationalities that specifically arise in multi-alternative decisions. This study, based on pre-registered procedures, investigated such non-normative behaviors in a three-choice dot numerosity discrimination task. We systematically manipulated the value of the lowest-numerosity alternative (the dud stimulus) and quantified its non-normative effects on choice, response time, and confidence. We then explained observed irrational behaviors with a sequential evidence accumulation model featuring a “max vs. next” decision algorithm. This pseudo-optimal decision-making rule naturally captured a well-known non-normative choice pattern: the violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives. Our model also explained a multi-choice metacognitive bias, known as the dud-alternative confidence boost, by considering evidence accumulation dynamics right after stimulus presentation. By uncovering the computational processes behind these non-normative multi-choice behaviors, this study represents a significant advancement in understanding the core principles of decision-making.",

Experimental findings are often precise and simple but may lack breadth, while concepts that are broad and simple frequently sacrifice precision. Developing a theory that is both precise and broad requires added complexity, a challenge intensified by a human preference for simplicity and certainty. To address this, a theory-oriented, data-driven comprehensive exploration approach is proposed. This approach involves conducting a large-scale experiment with tens of millions of observations, followed by the development of a moderately complex computational model that aims to integrate all relevant factors for the research question. A similar strategy has driven breakthroughs in artificial intelligence over the past two decades, suggesting it could yield similar advancements in psychology.

However, research linking the microbiome to brain function is limited, particularly during child development, when tremendous microbiome plasticity is taking place and many mental health issues, like depression and anxiety, initially manifest.\n\nChallenges arise in studying the gut and brain together due to their complex and multidimensional nature, which complicates feature selection and data analysis. Multivariate machine learning techniques, such as sparse partial least squares (sPLS) regression, offer potential solutions by identifying combinations of variables that best explain variance in outcomes.\n\nIn the current study (N = 55), we used sPLS to identify linear combinations of brain networks (“brain signatures”) at age 6 years that maximally covaried with internalizing symptoms (anxiety and depression) measured at age 7.5 years, before identifying microbe abundances (“microbial profiles”) at age 2 years that maximally covaried with those brain signatures. Finally, we tested whether any microbiome features  (microbial profiles or alpha diversity)  were indirectly associated with internalizing symptoms via the brain signatures. We found that microbes in the Clostridiales order and Lachnospiraceae family were associated with internalizing symptoms in middle childhood through alterations in connectivity within emotion-related brain networks.",

          "abstract": "The Model of Excellencism and Perfectionism (MEP) proposes that the effects of pursuing perfection (i.e., perfectionism) need to be assessed beyond the effects of pursuing excellence (i.e., excellencism). Our objective in this research was to rely on the MEP to further our understanding of athlete perfectionism on two key points. First, we focussed on a scale designed to measure dispositional perfectionism and excellencism – the Scale of Perfectionism and Excellencism (SCOPE) – and tested the factor structure of an adapted version of the SCOPE for athletes (SCOPE-A). Second, we addressed the substantive question of whether perfectionism, beyond excellencism, is beneficial, unneeded, or harmful for athletes’ thriving (i.e., experiencing high levels of well-being and performance satisfaction). We analyzed data collected across four samples of athletes (total N = 1,549). The results of confirmatory factor analyses and multiple regression analyses provided evidence to support the factor structure of scores from the SCOPE-A, and the conclusion that, when it comes to athlete thriving, perfectionism is almost always unneeded and excellencism is almost always good enough. These results shed new light on the connection between excellencism, perfectionism, and athlete thriving, and contribute to future research examining the effects of excellencism and perfectionism in athletes using the SCOPE-A.",

          "abstract": "Everyday situations require us to face a tradeoff to inform our decisions: exploit known information or explore for new information. Although both have risks, empirical research has not shown whether individuals prefer exploring or exploiting across contexts. In the present study, we examined the explore-exploit tradeoff as a theoretical framework across two broad domains: decision-making and spatial navigation. In this registered report, we applied computational modeling to human behavior on a novel version of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) to predict behavior on a spatial navigation task in which the navigator must either exploit a learned, familiar route or explore a new shortcut. If the hypothesis that risk tolerance is a domain general trait is correct, we predicted that explore-exploit patterns would correlate across these tasks. We also examine the predictive power of computational models for the IGT on behavioral uncertainty and the role of confidence in spatial navigation strategy.  Our findings suggest that, while there is some overlap in risk tolerance between spatial navigation and gambling, the influence of exploration and exploitation on navigational decision-making is weaker than initially predicted.",

Both latter conditions are usually not mentioned in the literature among consequences of physical abuse. Furthermore, the maltreatment can modify manifestations of affective disorders. Prolonged maltreatment can induce psychiatric abnormalities also in initially healthy individuals, in particular, paranoid ideations. Children and adolescents regularly punished for hyperactivity or other behaviors, regarded by perpetrators to be undesirable, would discontinue these behaviors but start adaptive or maladaptive conduct that may be more or less compatible with autism spectrum and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Repetitive binge drinking can be compulsive. Besides, loitering with drinking companies is a way of escape from domestic violence. It is known that autistic persons tend to avoid socialization. However, in conditions of collectivism and a pressure to be “normal” like everyone, individuals with communication abnormalities would have strong motives to contact with peers to avoid stigmatization. Alcohol consumption and, in particular, binge drinking is a method to overcome communication barriers. In doing so, the individuals often forget that excessive alcohol consumption may cause health problems.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive impairment (problems in thinking, learning, remembering, judging, and decision-making) is central to many mental health disorders and often appears long before the onset of psychiatric symptoms. As psychiatric disorders are often heritable, children with first-degree relatives affected by severe mental illness are at higher risk for future psychiatric disorders, potentially showing early psychiatric symptoms. Our study explored the potential association between cognitive impairments and early subsyndromal psychiatric symptoms in at-risk youths from a transdiagnostic perspective. We analyzed 970 at-risk youth (aged nine to ten) with 970 matched controls from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and found they performed worse in some cognitive domains and exhibited more psychiatric symptoms than controls. Our multivariate analyses revealed a pattern most strongly linking emotional dysfunction symptoms and cognitive language abilities in at-risk youth, suggesting a link between cognitive impairment in at-risk youth and a higher prevalence of early psychiatric symptoms. Such association could potentially guide prediction, prevention and early intervention for children who are more at risk of developing mental illness later in life.",

          "abstract": "Meditation training is widely used to enhance mental well-being. However, a mechanistic cognitive science framework for understanding how it transforms mental processing is still needed. The act of practicing meditation involves trying to be deliberately conscious of a target content. This requires monitoring the contents of one’s consciousness and regulating them in favor of the target. I propose, this involves a metacognitive template of the target being present in consciousness, which when compared to the actual conscious content generates a “metacognitive prediction error” (MPE). MPE leads to efficient regulation of conscious content by helping fine-tune the frequency of monitoring, downstream unconscious processing, and the metacognitive template itself. The proposed framework parsimoniously explains existing neuroscientific findings on meditation and generates testable hypotheses.",

We investigated the concept in four experiments (total N = 2,020), investigating why radically different kinds of people, ranging from peaceful advocates to fierce warriors, can each be considered badasses. Experiment 1 found that badass is a dual-character concept. That is, people rely on two sets of criteria when judging badassness: a superficial, concrete sense and a deeper, abstract sense. Experiment 2 suggested that these two senses of badassness reflect outer toughness (e.g., physical strength and a formidable presence) versus inner toughness (e.g., moral resilience and courage). Experiments 3-4 explored the qualities that make a person tough “on the inside,” revealing effects of overcoming social pressure, doing the morally right thing, taking on difficult challenges, and succeeding in one’s efforts. Overall, in addition to clarifying this particular concept, our findings contribute to more general, theoretical work on dual-character concepts and offer insight into the use of dual-character concepts in social cognition.",

          "abstract": "Although factor models have been pivotal in understanding the relations among variables, they are difficult to apply to data from experimental designs. In experiments, data are from trials which are nested in conditions, tasks, and individuals. Data at the trial level is quite noisy, so much so that even averages on critical contrasts are subject to excessive measurement error. In this paper, we develop hierarchical factor models where the first level are linear models that account for trial noise and are parameterized with separate, latent individual-by-task scores. The second level consists of factor models on latent individual-by-task scores. Because the model is hierarchical, Bayesian analysis is convenient and conceptually straightforward. We provide development with good computational properties. The advatages of the model are that (a) correlations across tasks may be both disattenuated and localized fairly precisely; (b) uncertainty from both variability in individuals and across trials may be accurately assessed; and (c) factor structures may be recovered even in high-measurement-error contexts. Applications to visual illusions and to cognitive control are included.",

To address this gap, we apply network control theory to examine neural dynamics corresponding to dissociative states in two contexts: intravenous ketamine administration, an anesthetic known to induce dissociative states (n=30, healthy volunteers), and therapeutic interventions in PTSD patients expected to alleviate dissociative symptoms (n=78). Ketamine administration led to brain dynamics resembling those observed in PTSD patients pre-treatment, with increased dominance of a default mode network meta-state and decreased dominance of a somatomotor meta-state. While ketamine did not significantly alter the brain's energetic landscape, transition energies increased post-treatment in PTSD patients, potentially indicating more organized and less entropic brain dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Research suggests that ADHD and ASD are similar in sensory processing impairments, however this has not been previously assessed psychophysically. Previous work further suggests that comorbid conditions, especially anxiety, play a role in the relationship between ADHD, ASD and sensory processing. Here, we formally test if orientation discrimination performance is differentially related to the levels of ADHD/ASD traits in a sub-clinical sample and whether anxiety plays a role in that relationship.\nMethods: We evaluate visual discrimination thresholds in participants exhibiting sub-clinical levels of ADHD or ASD traits through an orientation discrimination task. This is achieved using a method of constant stimuli within a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm, employing an adaptive, randomly interleaved staircase procedure with a one-up-three-down design. We then compare these pre-consciously inferred results to self reported traits of anxiety, ADHD and ASD traits via correlational analysis and further seek to investigate the possible mediating role of anxiety between the traits and the thresholds through a mediation analysis.\nResults: We find that ADHD and ASD-like traits present with similar levels of sensory processing impairments. However,  panic and generalised anxiety are critically involved in and mediate fully or partially only the relationship between ADHD-hyperactive traits and the discrimination thresholds. Such patterns did not present for any of the ASD traits.  \nConclusions: These findings suggest that ADHD and ASD are separate from each other and that their seemingly similar sensory expressions are only connected via intermediary conditions",

          "abstract": "In the last two decades, individual differences have been widely examined from a person-oriented approach which tends to classify individuals into personality types based on their unique configurations of personality traits. Previous typological studies have explored the consistency of personality profiles by varying different methodological factors (e.g., sample characteristics, personality theoretical frameworks, personality assessment methods, and data analysis methods). The aim of the study was to explore the replicability of personality profiles based on three major personality models (Big Five, HEXACO, and Tellegen’s model) across two large SAPA (Synthetic Aperture Personality Assessment) datasets. Data analysis included the following steps: model-based clustering, profile similarity assessment, evaluation of class replicability, and comparison of merged classes’ profiles in both samples. Four robust personality types re-emerged within the Big Five domain, three from Tellegen’s model and three from the HEXACO model. However, in the case of the Big Five and Tellegen’s models, the results demonstrated congruence with previous findings, whereas HEXACO results showed little evidence of class/profile robustness. This exploratory study highlights the importance of personality profiles in personality assessment which could be further investigated with new data sources such as SAPA and advanced statistical tools.",

          "abstract": "Western tonal music uses harmonic cadences as structural and syntactic markers. This study examines cadence perception regarding the role of pre-cadential and cadential mode congruence. Major-to-minor and minor-to-major mode shifts that occur in Parallel-Mode Tonic (PMT) and Deceptive cadences were of interest, with the former including a key change. 61 adults with varied musical training rated arousal, valence, and degree of completion (DOC) for four cadence types (Authentic, PMT, Deceptive, and Neapolitan) in two pre-cadential modes (major or minor). Arousal ratings did not vary much across all cadence types and mode variations. In contrast, valence perception was predominantly influenced by the pre-cadential mode with major mode receiving higher ratings, and DOC perception further correlated with the final chord’s within-context tonal stability. Importantly, the perception of PMT cadences was unique in that the mode of the final tonic chord became far more important in both valence and DOC ratings, pointing to privileged and distinct perceptual processing when mode shifts resolve on a tonic chord, especially of major mode (i.e., Picardy Third). Musical training manifested as significantly enhanced rating tendencies which were most apparent for DOC. The results substantially extend our understanding of the interactive nature of modes, tonality, and expertise in music perception.",

          "abstract": "Human decision-making favors approach behavior to gain rewards and avoidance behavior to prevent punishment. While adaptive in some cases, this Pavlovian bias can also interfere with instrumental motivation, leading to suboptimal decisions. As maladaptive avoidance is a known maintenance factor in anxiety and depression, this could be especially relevant to individuals with these disorders. To assess whether Pavlovian bias is altered in this population, we examined 106 healthy comparisons (HCs), 88 individuals with depression (Dep), and 184 with comorbid anxiety and depression (AnxDep) using an Orthogonalized Go/No-Go Task. Participants’ choices and reaction times were modeled using a reinforcement learning and drift diffusion model (RL-DDM). As expected, results showed that accuracy was highest when Pavlovian and instrumental biases aligned and lowest when they conflicted. Linear models revealed no group differences in accuracy, reaction times, or any of the computational parameters. However, within the AnxDep group, Pavlovian bias was positively associated with depression severity and other affective symptoms, such as rumination and anxiety sensitivity. Consistent with this, levels of depression, rumination, and anxiety sensitivity in this group were each also negatively associated with accuracy on the task when approach actions were required to avoid punishment. These results suggest that Pavlovian bias may contribute to symptom severity within affective disorders by suppressing approach behaviors when they would be adaptive – potentially amplifying the avoidance behaviors known to maintain these disorders.",

          "abstract": "Bliss, akin to flourishing, represents a holistic state of optimal well-being that transcends fleeting happiness, encompassing physical, emotional, social, and spiritual dimensions. It goes beyond mere survival, integrating physical, economic, social, mental, and spiritual well-being, extending into eternity. At its core is a divine essence rooted in a secure, personal relationship with a benevolent God. This connection forms the foundation for four core virtues: Linkedness, Opulence, Valory, and Equanimity—acronymised as LOVE.\nLinkedness emphasizes secure relationships founded on acceptance and belonging, fostering connections with God, others, and the cosmatos—the universal interdependent world. Opulence highlights a secure sense of provision and achievement, ensuring access to essential resources and affirming one’s capacity to achieve personal and collective goals. Valory focuses on meaning and engagement, encouraging participation in purposeful activities that benefit oneself and others. Equanimity embodies tranquillity and resilience, promoting contentment through gratitude and growth through adversity, sustained by faith and hope.\nThe LOVE Model is the first relational psychological framework of bliss, integrating the transformative roles of attachment, spirituality (attachment to the divine), and adversity. It underscores agape—selfless, unconditional divine love—as the primary source of the LOVE virtues and the essential foundation for bliss (Thayer &amp; Smith, 2016). Unlike models that rely on ethical principles or human effort, the LOVE Model highlights the transformative power of a secure spiritual attachment to God, fostering virtues that enable holistic well-being.\nInnovatively, the model introduces Differential Bliss Receptibility (DBR), which suggests that adversity heightens spiritual sensitivity, enabling individuals to transform adversity into growth, ultimately, bliss. By framing adversity as a catalyst for flourishing and emphasising secure divine attachment, the LOVE Model bridges psychology and spirituality, offering a transcendent, adaptable framework for well-being across diverse contexts.",

The research addresses a gap in existing literature predominantly focused on WEIRD populations. The study employed multiple regression analyses and bootstrapping techniques to evaluate these relationships. The findings reveal that positive coping significantly enhances the positive relationship between spirituality and flourishing, particularly under high-stress conditions, whereas negative coping exacerbates stress, diminishing well-being. Specifically, high spirituality combined with positive coping strategies resulted in greater flourishing despite high-stress levels. Conversely, negative coping undermined these benefits. The implications underscore the importance of fostering positive coping mechanisms alongside spiritual practices to promote resilience and well-being. This study supports the existential positive psychology framework, emphasising the role of suffering in authentic well-being and aligning with the concept of complementarity in second-wave positive psychology.",

          "abstract": "The current study aimed to systematically examine the positive effects of adversity on the relationship between religiosity, spirituality, and depression. The search for studies involved 7 databases (via EBSCOhost), involving studies of the past 23 years from the year 2000 to 2022. The general search included keywords such as religion, religiosity, spirituality, adversity, stressful life experiences, and depression. Data was synthesised using a narrative synthesis approach. The extracted data were coded and grouped into themes, revealing relationships between adversity, religiosity, spirituality, and depression. The themes concerning contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes were then synthesised to identify emerging contexts and outcomes. The review found that, despite posing the risk of psychological distress in the short term, adversity could provide differential spiritual receptivity: a long-term morphological advantage for spiritual receptivity, growth and mental resilience. The protective effects of spirituality against depression (by significantly reducing the onset of depression and diminishing the probability of episode relapses) appear more significant in people who experience severe adversity. In contrast, religiosity appears more potent in individuals who experience less severe adversity. The research and clinical practice implications of these findings are also discussed.\n\n\nKeywords: religiosity, spirituality, depression, adversity, suffering, differential spiritual receptivity",

MET provides a lens through which AI can be understood as a responsive material that actively contributes to the artistic processes. Through an analysis of 18 eminent artists’ practices in which AI is structurally used, we explore four key MET concepts: radical continuity, creative thinging, enactive discovery, and attentive unity. This approach allows us to examine AI as an active material within a co-creative process, where artists and AI discover and use each other’s affordances, thus reaching a state of unity and co-agency. AI's capacity for unexpected outputs emerges as a central feature of the co-creative process, with artists leveraging serendipity to reveal novel artistic directions. This research contributes to understanding AI’s evolving role in art, positioning MET as a valuable framework for examining the intersection between serendipity, co-agency, and materiality within the co-creative process. By acknowledging AI as a responsive material, this study reveals new directions for exploring the co-creative processes underlying AI use in art.",

          "title": "It is time to stop using the terminology “passive\" fatigue.",
          "authors": "Thomas Mangin",
          "abstract": "Fatigue is a phenomenon with implications at the individual level, causing daily perturbations for each of us. Fatigue also has societal implications, as economic costs and death have each been attributed to fatigue. To be studied accurately, it is crucial to distinguish the term fatigue from related terms such as boredom or sleepiness. The terminology “passive” fatigue is often used in the literature. However, “passive” fatigue is a broad term that is not specific to the task(s) used to induce fatigue. Indeed, the term passive fatigue is semantically incorrect as participants performing a fatiguing task are active and not passive. Moreover, the fatiguing tasks used to induce “passive” fatigue are typically monotonous, and induce boredom and sleepiness. In laboratory tasks, participants persevere in boring tasks in the presence of sleepiness, inhibiting their dominant response to disengage from the ongoing task, thus inducing cognitive fatigue or an ego-depletion effect. The boredom and sleepiness induced by the tasks used to induce “passive” fatigue likely explain the observed effects in the literature. It is therefore necessary to rely on solid theories, have accurate definitions regarding what is being studied, and have objective and subjective measures of the phenomenon of interest. In this context, we propose that researchers interested in the “passive” fatigue phenomenon systematically monitor fatigue, boredom and sleepiness; and refer to the concept of “fatigue induced by [name of task]” (e.g., fatigue induced by the Mackworth's clock) and avoid proliferating the generic and insufficiently precise term, “passive” fatigue.",

          "abstract": "The mechanisms by which humans select or arbitrate between different reinforcement-learning (RL) and decision making strategies remain poorly understood. Furthermore, the very nature of the strategies being utilized has come under recent debate. To address these questions we developed a novel variant of the standard two-step decision task and deployed it through multiple large-sample studies. We found that humans rely on at least three forms of uncertainty to drive the arbitration process: transition uncertainty, model-free reward prediction uncertainty and model-based reward-prediction uncertainty. However, these distinct arbitration mechanisms were heterogeneously deployed across individuals depending on which core strategies individuals relied on. Some individuals behaved in a manner consistent with model-free control, others were predominantly model-based, while others exhibited a mixture of the two strategies. These individuals exhibiting RL behavior can be further distinguished from another group that do not exhibit RL-like behavior at all. Each of these distinct strategy repertoires were related to behavioral trait phenotypes that are dissociable with respect to compulsivity and impulsivity, suggesting they are indexing meaningful individual differences.  Individuals differed fundamentally in the nature of the strategies that they arbitrated over depending on their core strategy repertoire: while some relied only on model-based control and arbitrated between different task models, others actively switched between model-based and model-free control. Our findings thus suggest that human reinforcement-learning varies considerably across individuals both in terms of the variables used to drive arbitration and the strategies being arbitrated over. While this complexity entails methodological challenges, it heralds new opportunities for attaining a deeper understanding of the nature of individual differences in human reinforcement-learning in both health and disease.",

          "abstract": "From at least age 6 children consider what someone could have done when judging their actions. Children are more lenient in their judgments of others’ actions if there was no other choice but to cause a bad outcome, as compared to when there was another choice available that would have avoided a bad outcome. Here we explore if children also consider knowledge of one’s options when judging actions. That is, are children equally lenient if someone makes a bad choice because they didn’t know another option was available? We tested children in China (N = 133), India (N = 133) and the USA (N = 146) aged between 5 and 10. We told children stories about three characters who either 1) had a choice and caused a bad outcome; 2) had no choice but to cause a bad outcome and 3) do not know they had a choice, and caused a bad outcome. Broadly, we find that children across all countries are more lenient of bad actions when characters in the story did not know they had another choice available. Overall, these findings provide evidence that children consider what others didn’t know, as well as what they couldn’t do, when judging their actions.",

          "authors": "Sergei V. Jargin",
          "abstract": "During the anti-alcohol campaign in the former Soviet Union (1985-1989), consumption of inexpensive colognes and technical alcohol-containing liquids was widespread. Drinking of non-beverage alcohol decreased abruptly after the campaign, when vodka and beer became readily available and inexpensive. Alcohol consumption predictably increased after the campaign. The upsurge in alcohol consumption facilitated economical reforms of the early 1990s: workers did not oppose privatization of factories partly thanks to their drunkenness. Following abolition of the state alcohol monopoly in 1992, the country was flooded by beverages of poor quality, sold through legally operating shops and kiosks, which caused severe poisonings. Thereafter, the quality of beverages has improved while the consumption tended to decrease. Besides, several aspects of treatment including invasive procedures applied with questionable indications are discussed here. A concluding point is that the society should care of its weaker members, including those suffering of alcohol use disorder and alcohol-related dementia, because they can be maltreated, abused and expropriated. In regard to the future research, toxicity of some alcoholic beverages sold in Russia is of particular importance. Of note, the military and medical ethics are not the same. The comparatively short life expectancy in Russia is a strategic advantage as it necessitates less healthcare investments and pensions. Apparently, this has been a motive of the unethical attitude to persons supposed to have alcohol use disorder, discussed in this chapter.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Consumption of added sugars is contraindicated for infants &lt;2 years old due to  potentially harmful metabolic effects. However, recent research revealed that most US-produced infant formulas contain added sugars. The current study examined the proportion of added sugars in US infant formulas to determine whether US formulas contain primarily added sugars, which may present a risk to infant metabolic health, or whether formulas contain primarily naturally occurring lactose (the sugar present in human breastmilk).\nMethods: Data were obtained from the Nutrition Data System for Research and represented US the infant formula market as of 2022 (N=73). Formulas were categorized into three mutually exclusive types by their marketing labels: standard (n=31), gentle (n=27), and lactose-free (n=15). The proportion of added sugars from each type of sugar were calculated, as was the percent of naturally occurring lactose. Differences across formula types were examined using Bayesian modeling. \nResults: The median percent added sugars was high in standard (M=59.7%; IQR=22.0), gentle (M=85.0%; IQR=39.5), and lactose-free formulas (M=90.0%; IQR=54.3). Gentle formulas had significantly lower proportional lactose (OR=0.22, 95% HDI=[0.11, 0.44], pd=99.3%) and had &gt;2 fold higher proportional added sugar contents compared to standard formulas (ORs=2.11 to 2.57, 95% HDI &gt; 0, pd=99.1-99.99%). Lactose-free formulas had 4-8 times higher proportional sucrose (OR=8.92, 95% HDI=[3.86, 20.8], pd=100%) and maltose (OR=4.91, 95% HDI=[2.51, 9.56], pd=100%) relative to standard and gentle formulas (sucrose 95% CI=[-1.67, -0.26], maltose 95% CI=[-0.35, -0.04]). \nConclusions: Most infant formulas on the US market contained primarily added sugars.",

          "abstract": "Importance\nPoor maternal mental health can negatively impact affected individuals and families. While genetic factors are important influences on mental health, few studies have used symptom-level analyses to examine how genetic liability is related to maternal mental health. A symptom-level approach can account for disorder heterogeneity and delineate key associations between genetic liabilities and mental health, improving current understanding of how genetic risk is related to the experience of specific mental health problems.\n\nObjective\nTo examine associations between genetic liabilities to depression, anxiety, neuroticism and positive affect, and maternal mental health phenotypes (i.e., symptoms of anxiety, depression, positive and negative affect) across the perinatal period and first years of motherhood using a network analysis approach. \n\nDesign, setting, and participants\nThree waves of data from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) were used to assess item-level associations. Sample sizes ranged from 46,537 to 59,308 mothers. Networks were separately estimated for each polygenic score (PGS) and each wave of measurement: at 30 weeks of gestation, 6 months postpartum, and 18 months postpartum. \n\nMain outcomes and measures\nSymptoms of anxiety and depression experienced in the last two weeks from the Hopkins Symptom Checklist and items measuring positive and negative affect (i.e., components of emotional functioning) in daily life from the Differential Emotions Scale. Four PGSs, indexing genetic liability to depression, anxiety, neuroticism, and positive affect, were included in separate networks.\n\nResults\nPGSs exhibited both phenotype-specific associations (e.g., depression PGS linked with hopelessness, anxiety PGS linked with worry) and cross-phenotype (e.g., depression PGS linked with nervousness, positive affect PGS inversely related to anxiety and depressive symptoms) relationships, with partial correlations ranging between r = -0.025 and r = 0.024. Items measuring mental health were strongly interrelated at each wave, in particular within symptom clusters and among emotional functioning items. Some PGS-phenotype associations were consistent (e.g., depression PGS linked with feeling like screaming or banging on something across all waves) and others inconsistent (e.g., anxiety PGS linked with nervousness only at 6 months postpartum) across the perinatal and postpartum periods.\n\nConclusions and relevance\nOur findings highlight symptom-level associations between PGSs and maternal mental health, which may be obscured when global measures of mental health (e.g., overall scores) are used. Identifying symptom-specific PGS associations could advance current understanding of aetiological influences on maternal mental health.",

          "abstract": "Adaptive learning systems (ALS) aim to tailor the educational material to match the student's needs, ultimately improving the learning outcomes. An ALS dynamically adjust the level of practice based on the student's ability, therefore obtaining accurate ability estimates is crucial. Since the amount of responses in a timeframe is limited, high measurement precision is unattainable using only accuracies, which calls for the inclusion of other data sources into the measurement. Here, we propose algorithms that can estimate the abilities on-the-fly based on both accuracy and response times (RT). These are extensions of a rating system called the Urnings algorithm. Since the Urnings algorithm uses discrete updates, building on the difference between a single observed and simulated response, we combined accuracy and RT into a continuous score using a discretised version of the Signed Residual Time (SRT) scoring rule. Through simulation studies, we showed that by augmenting the algorithm with RT, a reliable ability measure and better ability tracking can be obtained by administering fewer items. By reanalysing data from an existing ALS we showed that the algorithms can be utilised even if the SRT scoring rule is not explicitly used during measurement, providing better ability estimates and smaller prediction errors.",

          "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is one of the most frequently diagnosed disorders in psychiatric settings. Beyond the categorical diagnosis, borderline personality traits (BPT) are common in the general population and vary along a continuum from mild to severe. While prior research has reported functional connectivity alterations in the Default Mode Network (DMN), the Salience Network (SN), and the Central-Executive Network (CEN) in patients with BPD, the compromission of these networks in subclinical BPT remain underexplored. To fill this gap, this study aims to investigate the dynamic functional connectivity alterations associated with BPT in a subclinical population. We expect to find abnormal connectivity inside the Default mode network, the Salience network and in regions ascribed to mentalization processes associated with BPT. We also expect these networks to be associated with psychological symptoms experienced by borderline patients such as impulsivity and anger issues, lack of self-control and neuroticism among others. An unsupervised machine learning method known as Group-ICA, was applied to the resting state fMRI images of 200 individuals to predict BPT from the temporal variability of independent macro networks. Results indicated abnormal dynamic functional connectivity inside the salience network including areas implicated in emotional reactivity and sensitivity, and in network that partially overlap with the DMN and that includes regions involved in social cognition and mind reading, were associated with borderline traits. Specifically, the higher BPT, the higher the temporal variability inside the SN, and the lower the temporal variability in a network that includes DMN and mentalization regions. Notably, the BOLD variability of the SN correlated with neuroticism, anger problems, lack of self-control, and distorted inner dialogue, all symptoms displayed by individuals with borderline personality. These findings indicate that abnormalities in resting state networks are visible in subclinical populations with varying degrees of borderline traits, with impaired mentalization and salience networks and may pave the way for designing interventions to prevent the development of the full disorder.",

          "abstract": "Our visual environment often overwhelms us with more information than we can process. We can, however, enhance our processing efficiency by leveraging inherent regularities in the environment, such as prioritizing likely target objects over unlikely ones. Although there is evidence that statistical learning improves visual working memory performance, it is unclear whether this improvement occurs through stimulus prevalence or task relevance. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we examined whether frequent appearance or frequent probing of stimuli (or both) contributes to improvements in visual working memory recall. Participants were asked to recall and replicate the orientation of one of two previously presented Gabors as precisely as possible. In two experiments, we manipulated (1) stimulus prevalence by presenting Gabors more frequently on one side (either left or right), and (2) task relevance by probing Gabors more frequently on one side (either left or right). We found comparable orientation recall performance for to-be-remembered stimuli appearing at probable versus improbable locations, which suggests that regularities in stimulus prevalence did not improve memory recall. Contrastingly, we found better recall for stimuli appearing at locations that were more versus less likely to be probed. Specifically, task relevance enhanced working memory recall, both by reducing the number of categorical errors (e.g., misremembering a vertical-oriented Gabor as a horizontal one) and by increasing fine-grained recall precision (i.e., reducing minor variances in recall for memorized items). These findings highlight that statistical learning of task relevance, but not of stimulus prevalence, enhances visual working memory recall performance.",

In a young UK adult cohort, we aimed to investigate whether harmful gambling as measured by the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) would be associated with concurrent and future suicide attempts. Hierarchical models explored whether associations were robust to controls for adolescent suicidality and relevant confounders.\nDesign: A birth cohort study of the UK general population.\nSetting: Avon, UK.\nParticipants: n=2,801 (62.4% female) participants with data for suicidality at 24 years from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC).\nMeasurements: Past-year non-fatal suicide attempt prevalence was self-reported at 24- and 25-years (in 2017-2018). PGSI was measured at 20- and 24-years. Measured confounders were sex, maternal education, economic activity (employment/education status), hyperactivity, alcohol disorder likelihood, and adolescent suicidality.\nFindings: Past-year suicide attempt prevalence was 2.57% at 24-years, and 1.86% at 25- years. Confounder-adjusted models found that PGSI predicted suicide attempts at 24-years (Odds Ratio [OR]=1.13, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.05–1.21, p=.001), and predicted future suicide attempts over one-year (OR=1.15, 95% CI 1.06–1.25, p=.001), and four-year timespans (OR=1.20, 95% CI 1.08–1.34, p&lt;.001), but there was inconclusive evidence of this association over five-years (OR=1.14, 95% CI 0.995–1.31, p=.058). There was no clear evidence that increases in PGSI scores between 20- and 24-years predict suicide attempts at 24 years (OR=1.69, 95% CI 0.72–3.99, p=.230). \nConclusions: PGSI scores were associated with suicide attempts, however, this association may be more complex long-term, and increases in PGSI during adulthood may not be an important factor.\nKeywords: Gambling-related harm, Suicide attempts, PGSI, ALSPAC, Longitudinal",

Factor loadings were satisfactory and both subscales showed good internal consistency. Measurement invariance revealed gender differences in the WSSQ score. The construct validity was confirmed with strong correlations with emotional eating and food addiction. As expected, the WSSQ total score was moderately positively associated with depression and stress severity. The correlations were the weakest for retrained eating and body mass index.  \nThe Polish WSSQ is a valid and reliable tool for the assessment of weight-related self-stigma among patients with overweight/obesity. Future studies should investigate the gender differences as well as the test-retest reliability and longitudinal invariance.

          "abstract": "By the end of the first year, infants use others' emotions to interpret events, integrate social cues and build expectations on how people should behave (e.g., through social referencing). Yet, little is known about the neural correlates of linking others' emotions to their following actions. This priming study investigates 10-month-olds' electrophysiological (EEG) responses to happy and disgusted emotional displays toward novel objects (prime) and subsequent actions (pushing away or pulling closer the objects; target). Event-related potentials from 30 infants showed distinct neural markers associated with emotional processing of the prime, such as heightened early attentional response (Nc) and greater cognitive processing (Pc) in response to happiness over disgust. The target action of pushing away an object, especially following happiness, elicited increased slow wave activity, revealing working memory updating. Additionally, a significant mu-rhythm desynchronization, indicating motor resonance, was observed for the action of pulling objects closer when preceded by happiness. These findings indicate that by 10 months, infants attend to emotional cues and use these cues to form predictions about subsequent actions. These neural correlates of bridging emotions and actions before 12 months of life reveal, for the first time, early neural specialization for processing social cues in complex contexts.",

          "abstract": "Giving people more time between encoding information elements into working memory improves\nimmediate (i.e., working memory) and delayed (i.e., long-term memory) retrieval. This\nfree-time benefit is often assumed to arise from processes that counteract forgetting of the just\nencoded item in working memory, suggesting that time has a retroactive effect. Contrary to these\npredictions, a few studies showed that free time between two items in a serial-recall task benefits\nonly the subsequent (to-be-encoded) items, yielding a proactive benefit in working memory.\nHere, we investigate whether working memory and long-term memory benefit from free time in\nthe same way. In two experiments, we show that free time benefits the to-be encoded items in\nworking memory, whereas it benefits already encoded items in long-term memory. These results\nchallenge a single explanation of the free-time benefit for memory retention across short and\nlong intervals.",

          "authors": "Nadine Dijkstra; Peter Kok; Stephen M Fleming",
          "abstract": "Humans use similar brain systems to both imagine and perceive. While the re-use of brain systems specialised for sensory perception for offline simulation is an efficient use of resources, it also leads to a potential for confusions between imagination and reality. It remains unknown how human observers classify perceptual signals as reflecting external reality, as opposed to internal simulation or imagination. Here we show that judgments of reality are underpinned by a latent variable that encodes the combined strength of sensory signals generated by either imagery or perception. We use functional magnetic resonance imagining to reveal that this latent variable is tracked by the activity of bilateral fusiform gyrus and predicts confusions between imagery and perception on a trial-by-trial basis. We further characterise interactions between fusiform gyrus and a network of prefrontal regions encoding binary judgments of reality, in line with higher-order theories of reality monitoring. Our results demonstrate that a key mechanism through which the brain distinguishes imagination from reality is by monitoring fluctuations in the activity of mid-level sensory cortex. These findings increase our understanding of failures of reality testing such as hallucinations and lay the foundations for characterising a generalised reality monitoring system in the human brain.",

          "abstract": "The work proposes a set of hypotheses organized in a working model of the nature of consciousness and its relation with neural activity. Briefly, we suggest that consciousness, as a fundamental property of matter, corresponds to the differentiation of unitary portions of matter-energy from the rest of the space-time continuum in the basic form of waves, with their energy variation and spatio-temporal borders reflecting in the quality and spatio-temporal borders of experience. We then assume that the brain represents a unique generator of oscillations with complex spatio-temporal configurations that can produce transient events of synchronized neural activity across distributed cortical sensory areas (modulated by receptor stimulation and associative areas’ activity). Each event of neuronal synchronization might generate a large-scale wave, i.e., a unitary field perturbation, which integrates and differentially amplifies elemental and independent waves (where and when they appear) into a unitary portion of matter, manifesting as a frame of conscious experience. Accordingly, for each frame of conscious experience, the quantity of consciousness might be defined by the physical dimension of the unitary large-scale wave in the environmental field, while the quality of consciousness might be defined by the physical form of such large-scale wave along with its internal composition in elemental waves. This working model might provide a novel framework, along with testable predictions, for developing a wave theory of consciousness.",

There were 88 participants (M = 16.95 years, SD = 1.45; age range 13-18 years; 66% female, 30% male, 4% non-binary/gender diverse/prefer not to say), with bereavement (80%) or other loss (20%; e.g., parent divorce) randomised to intervention or control. Intervention participants received eight modules delivered over four-weeks. Participants completed a post-intervention assessment, with intervention participants completing a second assessment four weeks later. Findings suggest good feasibility, with adequate recruitment and 18% attrition. While no differences in symptoms of anxiety, depression, PTSD, or prolonged grief were observed between intervention and control post-intervention, there was a significant small effect on well-being in favour of the intervention. For intervention participants, there was a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD at follow-up, and moved from a clinical to non-clinical range of PTSD symptoms. Acceptability was high, 97% of intervention participants liked the program. The intervention should be further examined.",

          "abstract": "Background: Sensory changes are commonly observed in individuals with moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (msTBI) but remain under-researched.\nObjectives: This study examined the prevalence of sensory changes after msTBI and their relationships with emotional distress, functional disability, and life satisfaction.\nMethods: In a cross-sectional survey of 387 participants with msTBI (M=12.76 years post-injury; range=0.40–35.02) and 60 controls, we examined self-reported sensory symptoms across visual, auditory, gustatory, olfactory, and vestibular modalities, using a purpose-designed checklist and the Somatic Symptom Scale – 8. Emotional distress, functional disability, and life satisfaction were measured through the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 12-Item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0, and Satisfaction With Life Scale, respectively. We compared the frequency of sensory symptoms between the TBI group and control group and examined associations with demographics, injury factors, and clinical outcomes within the msTBI sample.\nResults: 75% of participants with msTBI reported experiencing at least one sensory change due to their brain injury, averaging 2.21 symptoms (SD=2.01)—significantly higher than the 43% of controls reporting sensory symptoms. Within the msTBI sample, sensory changes were more common in younger participants (light hypersensitivity), females (light and noise hypersensitivity), those with more severe TBI (overall sensory changes, affected vision, reduced smell), and individuals who were fewer years post-injury (overall sensory changes, noise hypersensitivity, reduced smell, altered taste, dizziness). Sensory changes were consistently associated with worse clinical outcomes, with medium-large effect sizes for emotional distress and functional disability and smaller effects for life satisfaction. Outcomes worsened with the number of reported sensory changes.\nConclusions: Sensory changes are a clinically significant yet often overlooked issue after msTBI, even among individuals more than a decade post-injury on average, underscoring the need for routine assessment. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind these sensory changes and develop effective interventions.",

          "abstract": "In an uncertain world, traditional decision-making models and wisdom cultivation methods fall short. Emulating exemplars or relying on mental shortcuts and habits may help in some situations but often fail with ill-defined problems and transformative decisions. We propose that cultivating metacognition—the ability to reflect on and regulate one's thoughts, goals, and emotions—is key to navigating these challenges. Metacognitive strategies like intellectual humility, perspective-taking, and open-mindedness help individuals discern complex situations, consider multiple viewpoints, and adapt their decision-making. Though not a cure-all, metacognition represents a promising frontier in cultivating wisdom. Insights from philosophy, psychology, and contemplative traditions suggest a range of interventions to foster metacognitive skills and enhance wise decision-making amid radical uncertainty. We call for a paradigm shift in how we approach judgment and decision-making, inviting researchers and practitioners to explore the untapped potential of metacognition in navigating life’s most complex challenges.",

          "abstract": "Anthropogenic climate change presents an intergenerational challenge, with its most severe impacts expected to affect future generations if current society fails to take action. Intergenerational psychology–specifically how people think about and care for future generations–has emerged as a critical driver of pro-environmental engagement, transcending demographic and ideological barriers. Insights from ethical philosophy, political philosophy, and behavioral economics further underscore the importance of intergenerational approaches in addressing environmental issues. We review the recent research on psychological interventions, legacy motivations, the principles of intergenerational responsibility, and behavior in economic games in the context of pro-environmental engagement. Broadly, this research has shown promise in promoting climate action across diverse populations through intergenerational framings. Importantly, intergenerational approaches not only inspire individual responsibility but also foster collective efforts toward sustainable solutions. Despite considerable emerging research, we point towards gaps in the literature for future research to address. Namely, there is a need for more research exploring the enduring impacts of intergenerational interventions using randomized controlled trials with longitudinal designs and examining their potential in promoting resilience and justice in the face of climate change. In sum, we conclude that addressing both climate change mitigation and adaptation through an intergenerational lens could be key to protecting the environment–not only for the present generation, but for the many future generations to come.",

          "abstract": "Individuals make biased and variable probability judgements. Recent models such as the Bayesian Sampler and Probability Theory Plus Noise capture these effects by assuming people randomly sample events but are biased towards indifference (i.e., 0.5). However there is a bias they do not capture: systematic violations of binary complementarity, i.e., violations of the simple constraint that judgments of P(A) and P(not A) should sum to 1. Until now, this bias was only captured by the sampling process of the Quantum Sequential Sampler. Here we develop straightforward generalisations of the Bayesian Sampler, by introducing an asymmetric prior, and Probability Theory Plus Noise, by introducing asymmetric noise, that can generate violations of binary complementarity. We next show that these three models make distinct predictions for the mean-variance relationship in repeated judgments. Finally, we investigate violations of binary complementarity in five experiments, where participants judged the probabilities of dice rolls. Participants consistently violated binary complementarity, independent of whether they were in a high or low probability environment or how the alternative options are partitioned. Crucially, participants showed the highest variability for probability judgements below 0.5, an effect captured by an asymmetric prior in the generalised Bayesian Sampler, but not by the biasing mechanisms in the other models.",

To advance a contested research topic, we engaged in an adversarial collaboration where both research teams agreed upon a set of critical tests and preregistered our analyses and predictions prior to data collection. Our study leverages a methodological innovation: To measure trait overconfidence absent task-related confounds, we developed a set of novel tasks where performance is ostensibly random. When we assess confidence this way, we find robust relationships across tasks as measured by both confirmatory factor analyses and raw correlations. This indicates that some people do believe that they are able to perform relatively well on tasks even when there is little reason for that confidence. Our results support the claim that overconfidence might be a trait.",

          "authors": "Nina Meret Zumbrunn; Karen Beckett; Johannes Alfons Karl; Fiona N. Newell; Louise Hopper; David McGovern",
          "abstract": "In recent years, a growing body of evidence has suggested that sensory impairment represents a modifiable risk factor for dementia. While previous reviews have considered the role of hearing impairment or visual impairment separately, no systematic review to date has considered the literature exploring the association between cognitive decline and having both visual and hearing impairment. Thus, the aim of this systematic review was to synthesise the published literature on the association between dual sensory impairment (DSI) and dementia by comparing individuals with DSI to those without sensory impairment and/or those with a single sensory impairment. A total of 22 papers were included in the narrative review, and 13 were included in the meta-analysis, which aimed to statistically assess whether DSI poses an additional risk of developing dementia compared to those with no sensory impairment and relative to individuals with hearing or vision impairment alone. Overall, we found a consistent link between dementia prevalence and incidence with DSI. Specifically, our results indicate that participants with DSI are at an approximately 50% greater risk of developing dementia compared to those without sensory impairments. Moreover, DSI was found to be a potentially greater risk factor for dementia than isolated hearing and visual impairment, with the risk for dementia in the DSI group exceeding the combined risk of the individual sensory impairments. While the review highlights substantial evidence supporting DSI as a significant risk factor for dementia and cognitive decline, it also acknowledges several limitations in the existing literature, including an absence of measurement validation, failure to consider sensory aids use and onset of sensory impairment, and the potential influence of sensory difficulties on cognitive test performance. We recommend that future studies should address those concerns, while also beginning to explore the effect of interventions targeting DSI on cognition.",

          "abstract": "An in-depth examination into the application of psychopharmacology in the treatment of personality disorders highlights the multifaceted debates about using medication for personality enhancement. Proponents argue that underlying biological disturbances might be at the heart of behavioral anomalies, and psychotropics could offer remedies. There's a perspective that positions psychopharmaceuticals as means for self-creation, allowing individuals to align their identities with their aspirations. However, counter-views voice concerns about the potential erasure of one's genuine self and the looming societal push towards medicinal conformity. Additionally, worries about the adverse impacts of medication, including potential long-term detriment, persist. The inclination of society to prioritize personality traits while underestimating situational factors adds another layer of complexity. Central to the discourse is the nuanced relationship between different layers of self —from the intrinsic, embodied experience to the externally influenced narrative identity. Ethical dilemmas, rooted in discussions around personal authenticity versus societal norms and the provocative proposition of perceiving certain personality disorders as moral rather than medical deficiencies, emerge. We emphasize the importance of an individualized, ethically-balanced approach in employing psychotropics for personality disorders.",

In this study, we leverage the Panel Study of Income Dynamics’ Transition to Adulthood Supplement on 1,081 young adults aged 18–28. Using sequence analysis, we examine how financial and co-residential support are embedded within the transition to adulthood. We study heterogeneity in support trajectories between and within families and disentangle the temporal order of transition to adulthood milestones. In line with existing theory on intergenerational transfers, parental economic support serves as both as an investment in young adults’ educational and economic pursuits and as a safeguard for struggling children. However, we also find evidence of more traditional, gendered pathways to economic independence linked to marriage: marriage facilitates economic independence and, for young men especially, achieving economic independence is an important precursor to marriage.",

          "abstract": "The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) is now an integral part of many occupational task profiles. Therefore, like mathematics and science, ICT represent an important content domain that adolescents may consider in their early vocational choices. Drawing on Eccles’ situated expectancy value theory and related theories, we hypothesize that adolescents’ ICT interest and self-concept should influence their vocational choices with respect to the intensity of ICT use in future occupations. Using longitudinal data from 1,964 Swiss adolescents transitioning into firm-based vocational education and training, we find strongly gendered patterns. Higher ICT interest predicts selection into occupations involving greater intensity of both basic and advanced ICT use, but only for girls. A more positive ICT self-concept is a significant predictor of greater occupational ICT use in future occupations only for boys, and this association is driven mainly by boys choosing careers as ICT specialists. Girls’ lower average ICT interest and their less positive ICT self-concepts explain almost half of the gender differences in the intensity of advanced ICT use. These findings emphasize that ICT are an important content domain of adolescents’ vocational choices today and highlight how gendered interests and self-concepts towards ICT perpetuate occupational gender segregation.",

Despite their significant role in the academic landscape, learned societies lack distinct recognition in global databases, which lowers their visibility and perceived impact. Using enhanced ISSN data and the existing ROR database, we present a methodology to identify learned societies based on their publishing activities and organizational names. Our approach is validated against national lists of societies from Austria, Finland, and the UK, demonstrating the feasibility and reliability of our method which, however, has several limitations discussed in the paper. Our findings show that 92% of 1,471 societies identified in ROR are currently assigned to ‘Other’ and ‘Nonprofit’ categories. We also highlight the geographical distribution and field-specific categorization of learned societies, emphasizing the diversity and scope of their influence. This paper contributes to the science of science field by proposing a framework that enhances the visibility and recognition of learned societies globally. Our research argues that ROR should consider enhancing their data schema to accommodate for learned societies. This way ROR can provide an open research information resource for identifying learned societies both for research and practical purposes.",

I review and catalog such potential criteria, then empirically explore researcher motivations for project choice through factor analysis of survey data from 409 authors of research articles in major public administration and public policy journals.  I find empirical support for personal gain, societal importance, and intellectual interest as research motivations.  These motivations do not neatly align with proposed ideal criteria for scientific choice.  Thus, such criteria must be translated to speak to researchers’ personal interests to achieve expression in individual scientific choice.",

In this study, we use the trust ecology framework to examine the role of affinitive, dispositional, procedural, and rational trust in support for fisheries management among recreational anglers in the Great Lakes region of the United States. We found that all dimensions of trust positively correlate with support for management, with rational trust being the strongest predictor. Demographic factors such as age, gender, and race showed minimal impact compared to trust dimensions. Our findings underscore the multifaceted nature of trust and its critical role in resource management and suggest that building and maintain multiple dimensions of trust can enhance public support for environmental management, ultimately leading to more effective and resilient environmental governance.",

          "abstract": "Following a brief outline of labour-power through Marx, Ciccarelli (2021) and my own work, it is argued that the fragmentation of Marxist work on labour-power undermines what is critical for its understanding in contemporary society: the notion that labour-power is a ‘unity of the diverse’ (Marx). In Marxist theory and empirical work today, labour-power as ‘unity’, as a unified social force within humans, is sacrificed to its ‘diversity’. The result is theorisations and empirical research that split the study of labour-power into seemingly competing projects; either as arguments regarding whether the key focus should be on the social production of labour-power through education and training, or the social reproduction of labour-power through the family and domestic labour. This paper argues that labour–power is better viewed through its various diversities that constitute its unity. Each of these diversities is a spectral (but real) point in analysis of labour-power, but its unity blends the pinpointing analysis of its diversities. These labour-power diversities are social forms of its social re/production that are manifested in and through various institutions in capitalist society. In this light, the following diversities of labour-power and their institutional forms can be viewed directly through the work of Marx: the social production of labour-power (e.g. in education and training); its social reproduction 1 (e.g. through the family and domestic labour); social reproduction 2 (e.g. through state pensions, unemployment benefits); maintenance of labourers 1 (e.g. through consumption, food); maintenance of labourers 2 (e.g. through health, and mental health services). These labour-power diversities constitute a web of social forms shaping labour-power in contemporary capitalism. The paper ends by exploring some recent empirical examples illustrating how moving between the spectral points of labour–power and its diversities solidifies their unity in analysis.",

          "abstract": "Science diaspora networks (SDNs) are integral to science diplomacy and pivotal in tackling local, regional, and global challenges. Given the increasing mobility and connectivity in today's world, these groups play a key role in building partnerships and promoting bilateral benefits through research and development. Our objectives in this study were 1) compile a comprehensive list of SDNs, detailing their goals, missions, and objectives, 2) evaluate overarching trends within these networks, specifically examining variations based on the network's age and the nature of relationships between host and origin countries, and 3) develop a flexible framework for the establishment of new SDNs across different countries, adapting to varying geopolitical and cultural landscapes.\n\nOur results suggest that most SDNs are hosted in North America, predominantly involving high-income countries with strong alliances. African countries lack active SDNs, though existing general diaspora networks could evolve into STEM-focused subgroups. Significant innovation potential exists within choosing host countries (e.g., LMICs or neutral states) and mission focus (e.g., grand challenges). To be effective at the foreign policy level, SDNs need to have a large member base or targeted goals. Our framework, complemented by a synthesized objectives list, guides SDNs in establishing clear value propositions for members and partners, enhancing their role in science diplomacy and addressing global challenges.",

          "authors": "Asad L. Asad; Livia Baer-Bositis",
          "abstract": "System avoidance refers to the tendency of individuals who are concerned about formal social control (e.g., incarceration, immigration enforcement, or the removal of children from their families) to avoid surveilling institutions that engage in recordkeeping. While this research locates concerns about formal social control in an individual’s sanctionable status, the laws, policies, and practices that generate the threat of formal social control vary across space and time. Drawing on theories of legal consciousness, this article posits that spatial and temporal variation in the threat of formal social control has differential associations with whether and to what degree individuals with a sanctionable status report involvement in surveilling institutions. Our empirical case is U.S. immigration policing, which burdens Latinos across citizenship statuses. We link individual-level data on institutional involvement from the American Time Use Survey with administrative data on immigration policing across state-years. Results from double- hurdle models show that Latinos in state-years with higher rates of immigration policing (1) are less likely to report involvement in surveilling institutions but, (2) conditional on any involvement, do not vary in the time reported involved. We evaluate variations by nativity, citizenship status, institution, and the presence of sanctuary policies that circumscribe immigration policing. We conclude that the threat of formal social control across space and time implicates the situational meanings of institutional involvement for subordinated populations.",

Given that the participation of stakeholders in the analyses is crucial for these perspectives to be realized, this requires research information analyses that are “open”. In this paper, we propose that this “openness” in research information concerns several dimensions. In the first place, research information should be open in the sense of being transparent and accessible. Second, research information should be open in the sense of being inclusive and diverse, which includes two dimensions: that stakeholders can actually use it, and that the contents include different types of knowledge. Third, the research information should be provided in forms that empower interrogation by stakeholders, so that they can retrieve and construct the descriptions of science and technology that are more appropriate for their context. This last step implies efforts to make visible many scientific contributions from the global south which are currently invisible. We call this vision “the multiversatory”: an approach to the observation of science that facilitates pluralistic analyses of the knowledge created across a variety of places and contexts, the pluriverse.",

          "abstract": "Traditionally, linguistics has focused primarily on human communication through visual and auditory modalities, while sensory modalities such as olfaction and gustation are relatively underutilized in human interaction, a trend influenced by evolutionary and societal factors. In contrast, animals employ a broad array of sensory modes in communication—olfactory, gustatory, photic, electromagnetic, and acoustic—thereby engaging in multimodal exchanges beyond the conventional realm of human language. This article reviews scientific discoveries, such as the role of pheromones in insect behavior and animals’ perception of electromagnetic fields and spectrums, to reveal the richness of multimodal and supralinguistic communication in animals, highlighting the limitations within human communication. Inspired by these sensory communication models, we explore how future technologies might expand human sensory capacity, especially in olfaction, taste, vision, and touch, enhancing the multimodal experience in human interaction. Through technological advancements, such as augmented reality, virtual reality, electronic noses, tongues, and brain-computer interfaces, humans could adopt more diverse forms of supralinguistic communication, thus surpassing the limitations of traditional language and achieving a more comprehensive understanding of the natural world. This study aims to envisage, from a linguistic perspective, the possibilities of sensory-enhanced communication through technological development, fostering a revolutionary transformation in human perception and communication and enriching the research domain of linguistics.",

          "authors": "Angelo Leogrande",
          "abstract": "The present research has delved deeper into the complex relationship of customer care calls with purchasing behavior in a WM system and has developed actionable insights to optimize operations. In this regard, the following critical factors have been considered: product attributes-cost, weight, and discount-on one hand, and delivery performance in terms of timeliness and reliability on the other, with a view to understand their impacts on customer satisfaction and interactions. Key takeaways are that high volumes of customer care calls reflect operational failure; there is a delay or expectation mismatch, and hence one needs strong process optimization. Also, heavy products, since perceived to be reliable, have fewer customer enquiries; lighter, cheap products cause more frequent queries since impulsive buying and lack of information occur. It further identifies timeliness of delivery as a main determinant of customer satisfaction while delays in delivery result in heightened discontent and rising demands for support. The study underlines the strategic relevance of advanced analytics, machine learning, and real-time monitoring to finally resolve the recurring inefficiencies. This may also be a good basis on which recommendations could be made concerning the use of predictive analytics for demand forecasting, effective logistical frameworks, and methods of customer service that would be in line with product-specific needs. Discounts become a two-edged factor: enhancing satisfaction but threatening brand value when used too frequently. In the end, strategies with discounts should be put into balance, proactive customer engagement should be there, with crystal clear communications with them, and the products to be more correctly described. The given study also identified how a warehouse clears the expectation from customers by applying data-driven strategies for better efficiency, customer satisfaction, and long-term loyalty. The above findings provide a comprehensive road map on how to integrate technology and customer-centric strategies in modern warehouse management.",

          "abstract": "Character patterns have been regarded as mystical mediums capable of influencing the surrounding energy fields since ancient times, often used for altering environmental energy or protecting individuals. Modern metasurfaces, on the other hand, are two-dimensional structures designed with nanometer or micrometer precision to achieve highly controlled manipulation of electromagnetic waves. This paper aims to explore the connection between character patterns and metasurfaces in aspects such as energy regulation, information encoding, and cultural symbolism, while further analyzing their multidimensional impact on technology, culture, ethics, and practical applications. By comparing the historical background, cultural significance of character patterns, and the physical principles of modern metasurfaces, the paper reveals commonalities between the two in energy resonance, information transmission, and geometric symmetry. Furthermore, the paper delves into the role of character patterns in psychology and socio-culture, as well as their inspirational significance for metasurface technology design. Finally, the paper discusses the ethical and socio-cultural adaptability of metasurface technology, providing valuable insights for future scientific research and practical applications.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, the application of quantum mechanics in life sciences has given rise to quantum biology, which deeply investigates the impact of quantum effects on biological processes, such as quantum transfer in photosynthesis and quantum coherence phenomena in bird navigation. However, the connection between quantum mechanics and the social sciences, particularly linguistics, has not been widely explored. This paper draws analogies between the discrete nature, superposition states, and entanglement phenomena in quantum mechanics, and the discreteness, ambiguity, and context-dependence in linguistics, revealing interdisciplinary similarities between the two fields. This analogy provides a new perspective for understanding the uncertainty and complexity involved in human language processing, and suggests the possible existence of macroscopic quantum states. Future research may uncover the impact of quantum effects on higher cognitive functions and promote a deeper integration of quantum physics and social sciences.",

          "abstract": "The use that agents do of cultural knowledge to navigate institutions is a major explanation of inequalities. Nevertheless, the difficulties accessing culture knowledge have led sociologists of education to often rely on declarative forms of culture to gauge explanations on inequalities. Based on the case of Chile, this study contributes to educational inequality research by using factorial survey experiments to assess the stratification of evaluative principles of educational quality or what is termed \"judgments of the game.\" Different teaching and school resources features were experimentally manipulated and presented to representative and probabilistic samples of parents and primary school students to measure their evaluative principles of educational quality. Findings show that socially advantaged parents and students, and from private schools, tend to evaluate educational quality more critically and attribute stronger effects to vignette features, suggesting cultural knowledge stratification. Thus, this study contributes to cultural sociology, sociology of education, and stratification research by testing one of the central theoretical propositions on the explanations of educational inequalities.",

          "authors": "Chloé Lavest; Mathieu Ferry; Mathieu Ichou; Patrick Präg",
          "abstract": "Estimates of intergenerational educational mobility are generally computed using a combination of self- and proxy-reports of one's and one's parents' education. Such reports are easily collected, offering a cost-effective alternative to collecting multiple self-reports or register data. However, the bias that proxy-reports could introduce in the measurement of intergenerational educational mobility is rarely assessed. Our study fills this gap and assesses how reliable people are when they report their parents' or their child's educational attainment. We find that both parents and children tend to underestimate the educational distance between themselves and their family members, thus inflating estimates of educational reproduction. This trend is larger when children act as proxy-reporters. Another limitation of using children’s proxy-reported information is the number of missing answers, which is lower when parents are asked to proxy-report their child's education. In a simulation exercise, we establish that the bias introduced by proxy reports is not negligible, with self-reported intergenerational regression coefficients being 16\\% higher when a proxy-report is used.",

The qualitative analysis shows both similarities and differences in how applicants in the two fields claim risks: in both fields, the most prominent notions refer to results and methodologies. While results at risk are interpreted similarly, methodological risks differ between the two fields. The analysis also reveals a greater variety of different risks in the SSH compared to the NSC.

          "abstract": "As automated decision-making permeates almost all aspects of everyday life, capabilities to generate meaningful explanations for various stakeholders (i.e., decision-makers, addressees of decisions including individuals, auditors, and regulators) should be carefully deployed. This paper presents a typology of explanations intended to support the first pillar of an explainability-by-design strategy. Its production has been achieved by pursuing a responsible innovation approach and introducing a new persona within the research and innovation process, i.e., a legal engineer, whose role is to work at the interface of two teams, the compliance and the engineering teams and to oversee the process of requirement elicitation, which is often opinionated and narrowing. Once explanation requirements have been derived from applicable regulatory requirements, compliance rules or business policies, they have been mapped to the dimensions of the typology to produce fine-grained explanation requirements, forming computable building blocks that can then be translated into system requirements during the technical design phase. The typology has been co-created with industry partners operating in two sectors: finance and education. Two pilot studies have thus been conducted to test both the feasibility of the generation and computation of explanations on the basis of the typology and the usefulness of the outputs in the light of the state of the art. The typology comprises nine hierarchical dimensions. It can be leveraged to operate a stand-alone classifier of explanations that acts as detective controls within a broader partially-automated compliance strategy. A machine-readable format of the typology is provided in the form of a light ontology.",

          "abstract": "According to sociological modernization theory, the shift towards a more meritocratic society should reduce the impact of family background on education and increase the importance of individual abilities. Sibling correlations have been used as an omnibus indicator of the importance of families for socioeconomic outcomes. However, sibling similarities in education are influenced by both the siblings’ genetics and their shared environments, making it challenging to interpret changes over time. This study examines the changing contributions of genetic and environmental factors to educational attainment among Norwegian twins born from 1915 to 1991. Using administrative data on education for more than 13,000 twin pairs, we applied a Bayesian hierarchical liability threshold model to estimate the heritability and shared environmental influences on educational attainment across birth cohorts, while accounting for changes in the educational system and population distributions. For women, the heritability of educational attainment increased throughout the 20th century, whereas the influence of shared environmental factors decreased. This pattern corresponds with sociocultural changes that promoted gender equality and expanded educational opportunities for women. In contrast, men exhibited no significant changes in heritability or shared environmental influences over time. This study adds to the body of research on how genetic influences on educational outcomes do – and do not – differ across historical time and social context.",

A multiple regression analysis indicates that social progress is correlated strongly to gross domestic product per capita divided by the cost of living and higher scores on a democracy index. Religious commitment, indicated by surveys of daily prayer, is correlated to less social progress. The research literature suggests that religious commitment leads to neglect of the prevention and treatment of diseases and injuries recommended by science, disdain for scientists, and acquiescence to or support of autocratic government. The trend toward autocracy in several democracies may lead to the deterioration of social progress. Increased global warming and the threat of nuclear winter depend disproportionately on the behavior of autocratic leaders in China, Russia, and the U.S. that neglect or deny the need to curb fossil use and express intent to expand their nuclear arsenals.",

One key finding is that only 20 of the 3653 of the International Environmental Agreements Database Project (IEADB) agreements refer to “women” (and only 16 mention “gender”). In contrast, for the same sample, 1431 Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) mention “men”. Furthermore, 35% of the treaties that mention women describe women as environmentally vulnerable. (Note: the inter-rater Cohen kappa score was 0.80, a substantial agreement).

          "abstract": "Prefazione al volume di Cristina Burini, Governare lo spazio pubblico nelle città italiane. Patti di collaborazione e imprese di comunità tra convivialità ed efficacia collettiva (FrancoAngeli 2025). I patti di collaborazione e le imprese di comunità regolano le attività e la governance di alcuni spazi pubblici. Alla ricerca di una espressione di sintesi per riprendere molti dei temi fin qui discussi, potremmo semplicemente dire che, quando governato in maniera partecipativa, lo spazio pubblico, può essere considerato un servizio pubblico. Come per tutti i servizi pubblici, la posta in gioco sta nella loro regolazione, e quindi nel modo in cui sono normate, contrattualizzate, remunerate, controllate e sanzionate le forme di gestione: in altri termini la loro governance. Cosi riconcettualizzato, lo spazio pubblico non è un luogo passivo di transito e interazione superficiale, ma un servizio pubblico che deve essere realmente accessibile: la vera sfida per le politiche urbane e la gestione degli spazi pubblici è riconoscere e valorizzare questa dimensione di servizio, dove l’accessibilità va oltre la semplice possibilità di entrare fisicamente in uno spazio e include la capacità di interagire, esprimersi e ricevere riconoscimento. Per questo manutenzione e sicurezza - elementi spesso visti solo come questioni tecniche - sono responsabilità comuni di amministrazioni pubbliche e comunità attive. Pensare lo spazio pubblico come un servizio pubblico richiede di riconoscere che la sua qualità e la sua sostenibilità dipendono dalla capacità delle politiche e delle comunità di co-creare uno spazio che sia accessibile non solo in termini fisici, ma anche sociali e culturali. In questo modo, la dimensione del riconoscimento reciproco e della reciprocità dissonante diventa centrale, rendendo lo spazio pubblico un luogo in cui le differenze possono essere accolte e integrate attraverso un processo di continua negoziazione e regolazione condivisa. In sintesi, la convivialità, la cura nella gestione e il mantenimento degli spazi pubblici non sono solo condizioni per un buon clima sociale, ma rappresentano le fondamenta per una socializzazione civica autentica. Questi spazi comuni, dove le differenze sono non solo tollerate ma accolte e integrate, diventano il perno di una cittadinanza partecipativa. Le identità collettive che emergono da questo processo, basate su un attaccamento emotivo e personale, mostrano il potenziale trasformativo degli spazi pubblici: luoghi dove l’agire quotidiano (Citroni, 2023) e le relazioni sociali contribuiscono a una coesione sociale che va oltre la semplice coabitazione, verso un’esperienza di comunità dinamica e inclusiva. Ecco la posta in gioco di una governance urbana di qualità. Indice del capitolo: 1. Lo spazio pubblico, non accessorio ma a fondamento del legame civile 2.

          "abstract": "To minimise confounding bias and facilitate the identification of unwarranted disparities, sentencing researchers have traditionally sought to control for as many legal factors as possible. In this article we challenge such approach. Using causal graphs we show how controlling for commonly used variables in the sentencing literature can introduce bias. Instead, we propose a new modelling framework that clarifies which types of controls are necessary to identify different definitions of sentencing disparities. We apply this framework to the estimation of race disparities in the US federal courts and gender disparities in the England and Wales magistrates’ court. We find that the model uncertainty associated to the choice of controls is substantial for gender disparities and for race disparities affecting Hispanic offenders, rendering estimates of the latter inconclusive.

          "authors": "Ashley Brown; Shane Johnson; Nilufer Tuptuk",
          "abstract": "Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) integrate advanced communication and autonomous driving technologies, enabling them to operate independently or with minimal human intervention. The anticipated benefits of CAVs are numerous and include making transportation accessible to all, reducing accidents due to human error, optimising traffic flow, and creating new industries and job opportunities. Autonomous driving capabilities in CAVs rely on advanced sensor technology and AI-driven analytics, which process data from multiple sensors to navigate, perceive the surrounding environment, detect obstacles, and make driving decisions in real-time. Despite the many benefits, CAVs will be highly vulnerable to a wide variety of crimes unless security measures are implemented by design. To understand the potential threats, this study introduces the enabling technology and reference architecture for CAVs and reports the findings from an extensive scoping review of the available literature. This covers reported crime incidents, academic literature on potential threats, a survey of academic survey papers on CAV security, and a review of papers concerned with cyberattacks against CAVs published in the past five years. The findings from the review are complemented by the findings from a workshop with experts about which of the identified threats should be prioritised for the purposes of crime reduction. The findings indicate that a wide range of cyber-attacks and offences are possible, and that the threat landscape is continually expanding due to insufficient attention being given to security during the development of the technology. Suggestions for policy and priorities for future work are suggested.",

          "authors": "Sezgin Uysal; Ismail Celebi",
          "abstract": "The study focuses on the temporal differences (30 years on average) between ethnic\ngroups migrating from the Austro-Hungarian Empire to the U.S. between 1850 and\n1910. In our study, we argue that the main factor that led to differences in the timing\nof emigration was the differences in regional economic development of different ethnic\ngroups living in different regions of the Empire. Migration costs: before the 1864 introduction\nof steam engine technology in transatlantic maritime transport, emigration\ncosts were not affordable for Hungarians and Slovaks due to the sea and land voyage\nhigh ticket prices. Therefore, with more resources, Austrians and Czechs could afford\nto migrate earlier. However, after the introduction of steamship technology and the\ntechnological change in ship engines, travel became more affordable due to reduced\nticket prices, faster voyages, and increased capacity. This allowed Hungarians and Slovaks\nfrom poorer regions to begin migrating in larger numbers as migration became\neconomically feasible. In this study, we utilise a complete count of the U.S. Census\nrecords from 1900 and 1910 (Helgertz et al., 2023; Ruggles et al., 2021), which Integrated\nPublic Use Microdata Series (IPUMS). On the other hand, we utilise economic\nindicators, which are regional daily wage, GDP per capita income and living standard\ndata for the Austria-Hungary Empire from Cvrcek (2013) and Schulze (2000).",

          "authors": "Carlo Drago; Angelo Leogrande",
          "abstract": "This paper investigates the implications of high HI35 days, which increase the demand for water and energy supplies, overconsumption, and higher emissions induced by cooling demand. Socially, HI35 is associated with health morbidity and loss in labor productivity; hence, policies directed at protection of the well-being of the poor, such as improved access to health care and good working conditions, become increasingly relevant. Extreme heat, besides, accelerates resource competition that may further develop into a civil instability, which affects governance structures. The nation will be assisted in addressing the impacts brought forward by HI35 through resilient infrastructure policy, good governance practice, and sustainable resource management. This paper, therefore, concludes that integrated policy action in ESG will be urgently needed to address the risk from extreme heat and calls for adaptive strategies that move toward environmental sustainability, social equity, and effective governance. Finally, HI35 is helpful to guide policy responses against different and interwoven challenges of extreme heat on sustainable development.",

          "abstract": "We estimate the relationship between people’s biased perceptions of their rank in the wealth distribution and savings behavior. Using unique wealth survey data from Austria, we uncover a significant bias in self-assessed distributional ranks. Our estimates indicate that individuals who underestimate their wealth rank have a savings rate approximately 50% higher than those who assess their rank accurately. Preferences that feature relative wealth in the utility function can explain this relationship. Our findings inform contemporary macroeconomic models and contribute to understanding the impact of information bubbles on economic decisions.

          "abstract": "Scholars from a wide array of disciplines have sought to identify the core features underpinning cohesion and cooperation within increasingly large, complex, and internally diverse societies. Previous work has suggested that as societies grow in scale and complexity, extreme forms of inequality  no longer provide a viable method of maintaining cohesion and cooperation. The relationship between these supposedly critical features, however, has not been subjected to large-scale systematic analysis. Here, we investigate the rise, spread, and impact of cooperation-promoting institutions and ideologies in a global sample of past societies. We find a clear divergence in the evolutionary trajectories of these traits: on one hand, certain ideological features relating to the adoption of moralizing religions, increasing complexity and professionalization of governmental administration, and maintenance of public goods clearly arise and spread alongside increases in social scale; on the other, ideologies and institutions limiting rulers’ power and authority are not uniformly characteristic of larger-scale societies. We discuss a range of possible interpretations for these patterns, noting that the forces driving these developments may operate on different scales of analysis and time-courses and suggest tentative explanations for these critical dynamics.",

          "authors": "Sara Amini; Lola Rousseau; Edgar Hertwich",
          "abstract": "As buildings become more energy efficient due to construction and technological improvements and stricter regulations, the impact of construction and maintenance materials is gaining prominence in the life cycle emissions of buildings. In high-income countries like Norway, renovation of the existing building stock is crucial for reducing overall environmental impacts. However, there is a lack of comprehensive data on the life cycle assessment (LCA) of Norwegian buildings, especially concerning material use and embodied emissions. Building archetypes offer a solution by providing structured background data to enhance LCA studies. This paper addresses this gap by examining the space heating demand and material use of residential building archetypes in Norway, categorized by type and construction cohort. Dynamic energy simulations were conducted using EnergyPlus, combined with the BuildME Python package for material aggregation and calculation. Our results show that structural components dominate the material intensity (MI) of most archetypes, particularly in buildings with basements. Multi-family houses (MFHs) built after 1991 outperform single-family houses (SFHs) and apartment blocks (ABs) in both MI and material per person (MpP). Renovating SFHs to accommodate more occupants could reduce their MpP while maintaining a comfortable living environment. The higher MI in ABs, driven by concrete floor decks, suggests that using wood in future constructions could significantly lower both MI and MpP, reducing resource use and embodied emissions. This work links energy performance with material efficiency, offering valuable data for improving policy and practices in the Norwegian building sector.",

          "abstract": "Background. There is a paucity of research that has examined how significant health, social, and environmental crises impact suicidal ideation, particularly where these events co-occur and have potentially synergistic adverse effects. The aim of this study was to identify the unique and cumulative contributions of mental health, social, and environmental risks on 12-month trajectories of suicidal ideation. \n\nMethods. A community-based sample of 1928 Australians (aged ≥16 years) completed online surveys measuring mental health, social, and environmental risk factors, and suicidal ideation at baseline, and the suicidal ideation measure was repeated at four follow-up timepoints.\n\nResults. Analyses showed five different trajectories of suicidal ideation (one stable low ideation trajectory; four vulnerable trajectories). A different set of risk factor variables predicted each vulnerable trajectory relative to the low trajectory. A cumulative risk index representing the combined effects of the mental health, social, and environmental risk factors also predicted each vulnerable trajectory relative to the low trajectory.\n\nConclusions. While adversity resulting from exposure to health and environmental crises was associated with suicidal ideation, the heterogeneity in how patterns of mental health, social, and environmental factors related to trajectory classes suggests that people experience these events differently. A cumulative risk index may be a potentially useful indicator of risk.",
