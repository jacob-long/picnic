          "authors": "Maxwell Semonian Vetter",
          "abstract": "The Hollywood Apocalypse Film and its tropes ultimately represent a genre interested in translating the horrors of colonial violence (mass murder, destruction and theft of land, forced internment) to an audience which both likely has not experienced said violence and potentially is not even aware of how it has directly benefitted their lives. This essay, however, examines the Indigenous Apocalypse Film, a rapidly developing countermovement to this genre, where members of indigenous and colonized communities create their own apocalyptic narratives reflective of their collective experience and history. The essay examines two prominent themes found in many of these films: the Apocalypse as allegory for indigenous trauma, and the reclamation of indigeneity as a tool of liberation.",

          "authors": "Nathan K. Mathews; Senne Braem; Eliana Vassena; A. Ross Otto",
          "abstract": "Everyday behaviour requires balancing two control modes: flexibility, for switching between tasks, and stability, for maintaining goals in the face of interference. One influential account posits that these two modes trade off: increased flexibility comes at the cost of reduced stability, and vice-versa. However, empirical support for this trade-off remains equivocal. We propose that this trade-off arises from reward-induced effortful control modulations during tasks that simultaneously require flexible and stable control. Across two experiments (N=80 and N=87), participants completed a task-switching paradigm in which cued reward incentives were manipulated over varying timescales. Large rewards increased flexibility, evinced by reduced task switch costs, but reduced stability, evinced by increased incongruence costs, indicating a reward-induced trade-off. In Experiment 1, such control adjustments— both at the block-to- block and individual differences level—followed this trade-off. Overall, these findings provide evidence for a reward-driven flexibility-stability trade-off; higher incentives promote flexibility at the cost of stability.",

          "authors": "Ana M. DiGiovanni; Brett J. Peters; Xiaomei Li; Ashley Tudder; Abriana Gresham",
          "abstract": "Co-rumination, defined as when individuals perseverate on problems with each other, focus excessively on negative feelings, and cyclically discuss the causes and consequences of problems, is often examined from the perspective of the person seeking support about a problem or by averaging both dyad members’ individual ratings of co-rumination. This approach muddles how each dyad member contributes to the “co” of co-rumination and may have implications for understanding prior work that has shown associations between co-rumination and intrapersonal and interpersonal well-being. We leveraged state space grids to examine co-rumination as a dyadic and dynamic system, as constituted by the temporal unfolding of each dyad member’s self-rated social rumination throughout their discussion. From 2019-2020, 85 primarily White and female college-aged close friend dyads engaged in a support discussion. After, friends viewed their recorded discussion and rated their individual contributions to the co-rumination process (i.e., social rumination) every 30 seconds across the eight-minute conversation. Results revealed that the more both dyad members got “stuck” engaging in mutually high social rumination (i.e., co-rumination), the more they perceived each other as responsive and supportive and viewed the problem as more solved. In contrast, the more that only the person disclosing the problem was stuck in high levels of social rumination or when dyads more flexibly engaged in social rumination, the more individuals with the problem benefited from the conversation, but responders benefited less. Examining co-rumination dyadically and dynamically can reveal when and for whom co-rumination processes are associated with costs and benefits.",

          "authors": "Shaheed Azaad",
          "abstract": "Theoretically-driven meta-analyses often involve testing whether study characteristics moderate an effect in a pattern that supports one of multiple competing theoretical accounts. To conduct such analyses, researchers must manually extract, i.e., code, these characteristics from sometimes hundreds of studies. Ideally, studies should be coded by two researchers independently to prevent errors and biases from compromising the dataset’s integrity. The laborious nature of this task, however, means that meta-analysts usually settle for double-coding just a portion of the studies included in their study. Some researchers have proposed using large language models (LLMs) as a double-coder, showing that they can reliably extract explicitly stated information (e.g., publication year) from articles. However, meta-analyses in psychology generally require studies to be coded in terms of higher-level conceptual dimensions (e.g., the type of behaviour rather than which behaviour). The present study investigated whether two LLMs, OpenAI’s GPT-5 and Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, can code studies in this way. Both models replicated study codes from three recently published meta-analyses in psychology with high accuracy (&gt;92% overall), despite limitations in the information that they received. LLM double-coding, therefore, offers a practical solution for meta-analysts seeking to ensure data integrity.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Psychotic experiences (PEs) occur across a continuum from subclinical phenomena in the general population to clinical disorders and are consistently associated with impaired social functioning. The present study aimed to investigate the network structure linking PEs, social functioning, and loneliness, and to identify the central mechanisms underlying these associations. \nMethods: We analyzed data from a representative sample of Slovak adults (N = 1200) who completed validated measures of PEs, loneliness, social functioning, emotional distress, social motivation, and mentalizing. A regularized partial correlation network was estimated using EBICglasso, comprising 17 nodes. Centrality indices and edge weights were used to determine the most influential nodes and connections. \nResults: The network revealed 40 non-zero edges. Friendship approach, bizarre experiences, social withdrawal, paranoia, and avolition emerged as the most interconnected nodes. Paranoia was strongly associated with loneliness and social withdrawal, while avolition was linked to loneliness and reduced social participation. Negative affect showed associations with loneliness and diminished participation. Social withdrawal linked negative symptoms to diminished social engagement and interpersonal communication. In contrast, hallucinations and grandiosity showed no notable direct associations with social functioning or loneliness. \nConclusion: These findings highlight paranoia, social withdrawal, and avolition as central mechanisms connecting PEs with social functioning and loneliness, while social approach motivation may serve as a protective factor. The results support a dimensional model of psychosis and point to early social and motivational targets for intervention.",

          "title": "Workplace Inclusion: A Social Network Perspective",
          "authors": "Taurean Butler; Emily B. Falk; Adam M. Kleinbaum",
          "abstract": "Workplace inclusion is fundamental to fostering diversity and equity in organizations, yet it\nremains inconsistently defined and operationalized in the literature. This paper integrates\nresearch on the psychology of belonging with social network analysis to propose a framework\nthat bridges organizational practices of inclusion, meso-level network dynamics, and individual\nexperiences of belonging. We define inclusion as the organizational structures, policies, and\npractices that foster a sense of individual belonging; we conceptualize belonging as stemming\nfrom an individual's experience of value, reciprocity, and fit. And we argue that organizational\npractices of inclusion shape individuals’ experiences of belonging in part by re-shaping the\nsocial networks that comprise their daily interactions. Drawing from social network research, we\nposit key structural indicators of individual-level belonging, including network centrality,\nbidirectional ties, and structural equivalence, which shape employees’ experiences within\norganizations. Applying this framework, we then highlight how employees from marginalized\ngroups are disproportionately excluded from informal networks, restricting their access to\ninformation, mentorship, and advancement opportunities, and changing the affordances of\nnetwork positions. We argue that social network analysis provides a potential tool to diagnose\nand address these disparities, enabling organizations to measure and intervene in structural\nbarriers to inclusion. By linking organizational-level practices of inclusion to the richly theorized\nindividual-level experience of belonging, with networks serving as the bridge, we provide a\nroadmap for future research and practical interventions that promote retention, well-being, and\nengagement among diverse groups of employees and advance a more coherent and actionable\napproach to fostering inclusion in the workplace.",

          "authors": "Ganga Bey; Natalie A. Rivadeneira; Catherine Berman; Mary Carmody; Elizabeth Brondolo",
          "abstract": "The Identity Vitality-Pathology (IVP) model is a novel theoretical framework that conceptualizes a modifiable health-determining construct, identity state, defined by three domains hypothesized to all stem from identification of the core self with the physical body: 1) a self-concept that is inclusive of all living beings vs. exclusive based on physical attributes, 2) the perceived basis of the worth of all living beings as intrinsic vs. extrinsic, and 3) the degree of universally compassionate orientation toward all living beings. The identity state construct is theorized to act through modulating stressor appraisal and stress-responsive behavior to influence the causal relationship between social position-dependent stressors, biological aging, and age-related diseases. The IVP Scale (IVPS) was developed to empirically assess the hypotheses of the IVP framework and the utility of the identity state construct for population health research. This study provides the first description of the psychometric properties of the long (20-item) and short form (12-item) IVPS. We used exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA and CFA) of data from two separate samples of self-identified Black and White adults (aged 18-81) collected in 2021 and 2025 (total N=2,318). Associations between the IVPS and related constructs of optimism, social dominance orientation (SDO), and resilience were examined to establish construct validity. EFA supported a unidimensional structure and CFA confirmed good model fit for both IVPS measures. Both scales are significantly positively correlated with indicators of optimism and resilience and significantly negatively correlated with SDO. These initial findings suggest the IVPS-20 and the IVPS-Short are valid and psychometrically sound scales.",

          "abstract": "Women are consistently judged to be more caring and communal than men. We find that moral goodness itself is feminine at the level of faces, traits, behaviors, and impressions (N = 5,376). Using reverse-correlation methods, we show that mental representations of the face of “a morally good person” is a woman’s face. When completing a novel profile-generation task, people ascribe more morally good traits to women than to men, both when they spontaneously think of a woman (vs. a man) and when assigned. Across 1,864 previously normed behaviors, we find that actions associated with moral goodness are stereotyped as feminine. Finally, in a novel impression updating task, we find that immoral behavior is more diagnostic for women than men; equivalent moral transgressions lead to larger negative character updating for women than for men. In sum, moral goodness is gendered: people think women are morally superior to men.",

          "abstract": "The spread of misinformation on social media continues to pose challenges. While prior research has shown some success in reducing susceptibility to misinformation at scale, how individual-level interventions impact the quality of content shared on social networks remains understudied. Across two pre-registered longitudinal studies, we ran two Twitter/X ad campaigns, targeting a total of 967,640 Twitter/X users with either a previously validated “inoculation” video about emotional manipulation or a control video. We hypothesized that Twitter/X users who saw the inoculation video would engage less with negative-emotional content and share less content from unreliable sources. We do not find evidence for our hypotheses, observing no meaningful changes in posting or retweeting post-intervention. Our findings are most likely compromised by Twitter/X’s “fuzzy matching” policy, which introduced substantial noise in our data (~7.5% of targeted individuals were actually exposed to the intervention). Our findings are thus likely the result of treatment non-compliance rather than “true” null effects. Importantly, we also demonstrate that different statistical analyses and time windows (looking at the intervention’s effects over 1 hour versus 6 hours or 24 hours, etc.) can yield different and even opposite significant effects, highlighting the risk of interpreting noise from field studies as signal.",

          "abstract": "A central debate in cognitive science concerns whether knowledge or belief is the primary cognitive attitude in our Theory of Mind. \"Knowledge-First\" accounts posit that knowledge is a fundamental, while traditional \"Belief-First\" accounts view it as a complex derivative of belief. Gettier cases, where justified true belief can fall short of knowledge, serve as a cornerstone of this debate. We tested the robustness and developmental trajectory of this intuition, and its relation to belief-desire psychology. Across three studies using novel, non-verbal video vignettes we found that both adults and children (5-8 years) systematically denied knowledge in Gettier tasks. Crucially, while the experimental task (True Belief vs. Gettier cases) strongly influenced knowledge attributions, it had little direct effect on action predictions in adults and children. The key factor influencing action prediction in adults was whether participants had attributed or denied knowledge beforehand. Despite all participants attributing the relevant belief, when knowledge was denied, participants became significantly slower and more uncertain in their predictions. Our findings are compatible with dual-process accounts, suggesting the primacy of knowledge in theory of mind.",

          "authors": "Noah M. Laskey; Spike W. S. Lee",
          "abstract": "Hundreds of studies have identified psychological and behavioral differences between liberals and conservatives. Many of these differences, however, shrink or vanish under conditions like cognitive load, heightened threat, and pharmacological interruptions of executive functioning. To explain why these “ideological shifts” occur, we offer a dual-process model of ideology. It postulates that liberals and conservatives have more similar automatic than controlled processes in response to social and moral stimuli. What unifies numerous ideological shift-inducing conditions is that they undermine the influence of relatively controlled processes or amplify that of relatively automatic processes. Under these conditions, outcomes are guided more by relatively automatic processes such as intuitions (e.g., ingroup favoritism, outgroup derogation) that are similar across the aisle, less by relatively controlled processes such as explicit ideological prescriptions (e.g., outgroup tolerance) that differ across the aisle. We illustrate our model’s explanatory power with multiple lines of research, from ideological shifts to moral foundations to implicit bias, which consistently reveal more similar responses between liberals and conservatives when relatively automatic processes prevail over controlled ones. Contrary to influential perspectives (e.g., Moral Foundations Theory), our model posits—and evidence supports—that many differences between liberals and conservatives are driven not by irreconcilable social intuitions, but by controlled processes for maintaining ideological concordance. Our model has theoretical, applied, methodological, and empirical implications. One of them is that liberals’ and conservatives’ similar automatic processes could be leveraged for both beneficial (e.g., reducing interpersonal friction in cross-aisle dialogue) and harmful outcomes (e.g., exacerbating outgroup prejudices).",

          "authors": "Juan Carlos Chávez-Autor",
          "abstract": "Creativity is often framed as the output of either fast, associative intuition (System 1) or slow, rule-based analysis (System 2). This Conceptual Analysis advances System 3, a compact, falsifiable account in which creativity arises from a tightly coupled generate–evaluate–gate micro-cycle. System 3 both iterates (rapid alternation between associative and evaluative processing) and integrates (affect-laden, phenomenological signals that bias exploration with rational-logical codes—constraints and decision confidence—that enforce evaluation) under metacognitive control operating in two forms: explicit (conscious, reportable monitoring and strategy selection) and implicit (non-conscious confidence/error signals that bias attention, evaluation, and gating). We render the framework testable through three behavioral indices: associative-distance density (breadth and rate of semantic exploration), analytic-verification ratio (degree of online checking), and convergence latency (commit speed at a fixed quality threshold). The account links these indices to large-scale brain dynamics—cooperation and switching between the Default Mode and Central Executive networks—and to neuromodulatory gains (dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, acetylcholine) that tune explore–exploit balance and network integration–segregation. System 3 yields clear predictions and disconfirmers: non-disruptive bias toward Default Mode should increase density and track judged originality at matched fluency; bias toward Central Executive should raise the verification ratio and improve judged usefulness at matched density; alternating Default-Mode/Central-Executive bias should phase-lock verification to evaluative epochs and reduce latency; and, under weak monitoring, density should follow an inverted-U with usefulness that shifts toward joint gains as monitoring strengthens. By linking measurable behavior to network dynamics and control signals, System 3 offers an adjudicable roadmap for explaining and responsibly enhancing creative cognition.",

          "abstract": "Language proficiency is a central construct in second language learning research, yet it is frequently operationalised through indirect or proxy measures such as self-ratings, academic achievement, or self-perceived competence. While these indicators offer practical advantages, they risk misrepresenting learners’ actual ability and distorting theoretical inferences. The present study investigated the extent to which learners accurately estimate their own English proficiency and examined the empirical consequences of substituting proxy variables for an objective proficiency measure. A total of 228 English language learners completed the Oxford Placement Test alongside measures of self-rated CEFR proficiency, self-perceived communication competence, and self-reported academic achievement. Only 37% of participants accurately estimated their proficiency, with lower-level learners tending to overestimate and advanced learners to underestimate their abilities. Correlations between the Oxford Placement Test and proxy variables were modest (r = .20–.49), and structural equation models using proxies in place of objective proficiency produced results differing in strength and directionality in explanatory models. These findings illustrate the price of convenience: while proxy variables are practical, their use impacts the findings of studies and may compromise validity. The study calls for renewed methodological caution and greater investment in direct, standardised proficiency assessments within applied linguistics research.",

          "abstract": "Background: Mindful activities are recommended to support and improve student wellbeing. Mindful colouring in particular is a low-cost, low-effort intervention shown to improve student wellbeing, mental health, and mindfulness. Less evidence exists about the effectiveness of different colouring formats, such as paper versus digital. This study investigated a self-guided two-week colouring intervention for university student wellbeing, comparing outcomes between paper-based and digital engagement.\nMethods: Two-hundred and ninety-seven participants completed at least six sessions of self-guided colouring for 10 minutes over two weeks. Participants were assessed using self-report measures of quality of life, stress, anxiety, depression, and dispositional mindfulness pre- and post-intervention. Effects of colouring over time, and between groups were investigated with linear mixed‑effects models.\nResults: Significant improvements were noted in all outcome measures, with large effects for stress (η²ₚ = .26), depression (η²ₚ = .17), trait anxiety (η²ₚ = .16), medium effects for mindfulness (η²ₚ = .10), and quality of life (η²ₚ = .12), and small effects for state anxiety (η²ₚ = .03). There was a small but significant time x group interaction for dispositional mindfulness, where the digital colouring group experienced a greater increase in compared to the paper colouring group. \nConclusion: Digital colouring has notable benefits to dispositional mindfulness. Regardless of format, mindful colouring can improve student quality of life, stress, anxiety, depression and dispositional mindfulness, when carried out regularly over two weeks. Colouring shows promise as a low-cost and accessible way to improve wellbeing in a higher education setting that promotes positive engagement with digital technology.",

          "abstract": "Rhythmic structure enables precise temporal expectations that are essential to human communication, including speech and music. Computational models have been developed to account for how humans perceive, produce, and learn rhythmic sequences. However, it is unclear how different types of models relate to each other and how they can be evaluated. In this review and perspective, we discuss how three major classes of models – entrainment, probabilistic, and timekeeper models – have been used to study rhythmic expectations. We critically assess each model class in terms of its level of explanation, the rhythmic behaviors it captures, its ability to account for learning and enculturation, and its ability to integrate other features, such as pitch. We show that entrainment, probabilistic, and timekeeper models differ substantially in the aspects of rhythmic expectations they can capture. To move the field forward, we propose that model comparison and integration are crucial. We identify key challenges to this effort, such as the varying nature of the input and output signals and divergent modeling goals. To address these challenges, we arrive at several practical recommendations: to equate input and output signals when comparing models, to consider several model outcomes beyond goodness-of-fit measures in model evaluation, to use model-integration efforts to inform theory building, and to make code and data openly accessible. Ultimately, understanding how models of rhythmic expectations relate, and how features in these models account for behavior, neural, and cognitive aspects of rhythmic expectations, will deepen our understanding of a core aspect of human behavior.",

          "abstract": "Recognizing emotional expressions is important for successful social interactions. Prior research has demonstrated that emotion recognition is influenced by evaluative associations people have with different social categories. Here, we systematically investigate whether reinforcement learning can modify social category biases in emotion recognition. Previous research has shown that reinforcement learning is a promising method for altering evaluative associations. In Experiment 1 (N = 40), we replicated that the Happy Face Advantage is influenced by social category membership. People were faster at recognizing happiness as happiness than anger as anger⁠ for White–Dutch faces, while no difference was found for Moroccan–Dutch faces. In Experiments 2–3 (Ntotal = 144), we used a reinforcement learning go/no-go task, in which people learned to act to images of Moroccan–Dutch faces to obtain rewards and to not act to images of White–Dutch faces to avoid punishments before participating in the emotion recognition task. Results show that reinforcement learning influences emotion recognition. Instead of the commonly observed interaction effect between social category and expression valence (e.g., in Experiment 1 and previous work), we consistently found a main effect of valence on emotion recognition. These findings suggest that aligning (in)actions with rewards/punishments changes emotion recognition.",

          "abstract": "A central purpose of exploration is to reduce goal-relevant uncertainty. Consequentially, individuals often explore by focusing on areas of uncertainty in the environment. However, people sometimes adopt the opposite strategy, one of avoiding uncertainty. How are the conflicting tendencies to approach and avoid uncertainty reconciled in human exploration? We hypothesized that the balance between avoiding and approaching uncertainty can be understood by considering capacity constraints. Accordingly, people are expected to approach uncertainty in most cases, but to avoid it when overall uncertainty is highest. To test this, we developed a new task and used modeling to compare human choices to a range of plausible policies. The task required participants to learn the statistics of a simulated environment by active exploration. On each trial, participants chose to explore a better-known or lesser-known option. Participants generally chose to approach uncertainty, however, when overall uncertainty about the choice options was highest, they instead avoided uncertainty and chose to sample better-known objects. This strategy was associated with faster decisions and, despite reducing the rate of observed information, it did not impair learning. We suggest that balancing approaching and avoiding uncertainty reduces the cognitive costs of exploration in a resource-rational manner.",

          "abstract": "According to canonical normative theories in philosophy, moral transgressions–like lying–are equally wrong regardless of whom they help or harm. In contrast, recent research suggests that people use social identity cues to make moral judgments and decisions. This paper examines the possibility that people misreport factual information to benefit the in-group and harm the out-group. Across three experiments, we gave U.S. Democrat and Republican voters (N=5,230) a chance to lie anonymously to double their own or another participant’s earnings. For selfish dishonesty (Experiment 1), people lied equally to benefit themselves regardless of whether it harmed an in-group or out-group member. For coalitional dishonesty (Experiment 2), however, people lied significantly more to benefit in-group than out-group members (9 percentage-points), despite not personally benefiting from lying. Experiment 3 successfully replicated these findings, and revealed that people overestimated out-group dishonesty more than in-group dishonesty. In conclusion, intergroup coalitional dishonesty drives moral decision-making.",

          "abstract": "Emotion characteristics, like emotion intensity and perceived emotion controllability, shape how individuals regulate their emotions. While the link between emotion characteristics and emotion regulation strategies seems clear-cut for some strategies, findings are mixed for others. This study proposes that emotion regulation choice may be best understood in a non-linear framework, where individuals may not regulate emotions of low intensity and/or high controllability, because these emotions require little regulation, but also not emotions of high intensity and/or low controllability, because these emotions may be perceived as  overwhelming and difficult to regulate. To test this hypothesis, we used data from a 60-day diary study in 79 adults (mean age = 22.29, SD = 6.08, 84% identified as female), who every evening reported on emotion characteristics (emotion intensity and controllability) and strategy use (distraction, rumination, reappraisal, expression, suppression, relaxation). In addition to single strategies, we also examined daily emotion regulation variability (i.e., the extent to which individuals vary in multiple strategies across time). We replicate some linear findings, including that expression, relaxation, and rumination were used with emotions of increasing intensity and uncontrollablility (for expression only). Importantly, we also provide novel evidence for non-linear relations, where suppression and reappraisal were used with emotions of average intensity and controllability, and less with emotions relatively low or high in intensity and controllability. In addition, individuals showed higher emotion regulation variability when emotions were relatively low or high in intensity and controllability. These findings combined highlight the value of considering non-linear relations when studying emotion regulation choice in daily life - both of single strategies and variability across multiple strategies.",

          "authors": "Alice Albertini Drew; Massimiliano Zampini; Salvador Soto-Faraco",
          "abstract": "For many, flavour is the quintessential multisensory experience. The experience of flavour arises from inputs across a wide variety of sensory modalities, including but not limited to taste, smell, sound, several somatosensory channels as well as a range of other anticipatory cues that trigger expectations about the flavour object (visual, smell through the nose, context, etcetera). The regulation of inevitable mismatches between these bundles of inputs is necessary not only for these to converge into a unitary flavour percept but also to determine a hedonic response by the consumer. Remarkably, a framework to understand the regulation of incongruities across levels of the flavour experience is lacking. Here, we draw on a range of evidence to propose that the theoretical framework of conflict monitoring, which is well established in other areas of human cognition, could plausibly extend to encompass flavour-related phenomena. More specifically, we argue that brain mechanisms monitoring for, signalling, and eventually orchestrating the resolution of discrepancies between cues are decisive for the emergence of a unified flavour percept, and its associated evaluation by consumers. This framework helps elucidate well-documented facets of the experience of flavour and suggests promising avenues for research both in the laboratory and in the consumer industry.",

To better capture its dynamic nature, we propose a shift from viewing acculturation as solely an individual-level adjustment to understanding it as a socially embedded and interaction-driven phenomenon. Building on recent insights from interacting minds, cognitive neuroscience, social psychology, and cultural psychology, we examine how shared cultural meanings are formed and reshaped through everyday interactions between immigrants and non-immigrant residents. We also emphasize the importance of methodological innovation, including naturalistic paradigms, social network analysis, and computational simulations in disentangling the complicated mechanisms underlying acculturation. In addition, by extending the scope of inquiry to less frequently studied migratory flows across regions beyond the classical East-West framework, future work should call for more globally attuned and multidimensional models of cultural adaptation. Together, these perspectives offer a path toward a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of acculturation processes.",

          "abstract": "In our folk psychology, which cognitive attitude that we ascribe is primary? Tra-ditionally, in epistemology and in Theory of Mind research in cognitive science, it was assumed that belief is the primary cognitive attitude, and that knowledge is second-ary, derived from belief (as justified true belief). More recent Knowledge First Episte-mology and Factive Theory of Mind accounts claim the revers: knowledge ascription is primary relative to belief ascription. Various sources of evidence are adduced in favor of these accounts, among them reaction time asymmetries: adults have been found to be faster to ascribe knowledge than belief to other agents. The present study tested whether these effects are robust and really indicate an asymmetry between knowledge and belief ascription. An alternative possibility is that subjects were merely faster in ascribing simpler, non-propositional states of information access relative to full-fledged, meta-representational, propositional belief ascription. To test for this possibility, subjects were asked about the knowledge or beliefs of agents in situations that did or did not involve fine-grained aspectual scenarios that require full-blown propositional belief and knowledge ascription. Across three studies, subjects (N~ 5000‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍) were faster to ascribe knowledge than belief across conditions and task variations that controlled for pragmatic and lexical frequency effects. Taken together, these studies present converging evidence that knowledge ascription is primary rela-tive to belief ascription and thus speak for Factive Theory of Mind accounts.",

Next, we describe key methodologies for enhancing FM performance in psychometric contexts via prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and agentic frameworks. We then examine the theoretical implications of FMs for psychometrics. Finally, we chart risks and offer actionable recommendations for the effective, rigorous, and ethical implementation of FMs in psychometric research and practice.

We contextualise states such as the jhānas within this process, drawing on both Buddhist theoretical frameworks and contemporary phenomenological understanding. We take a step towards ‘translating’ Buddhist meditation-based phenomenology into computational neurophenomenology. We demonstrate how Buddhist defabrication can be understood as a deconstructive process driving inference ever lower in an agent’s hierarchical generative model by the repeated release of mental tensing associated with clinging and aversion. We cast this release of mental tensing as corresponding to a hierarchical level-specific reduction in belief precision, permitting the interpretation of Buddhist notions such as equanimity and meditative stillness under AIF. We then illustrate the deconstruction process up to its conclusion in a cessation of phenomenal experience, touching on how states traversed during the process may inform areas related to core-knowledge structuring and the generation of experience.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Contemplative practices (including meditation and yoga) are increasingly popular worldwide, especially as alternatives and/or complements to mental health treatment. However, nationally representative samples that allow for accurate estimates of prevalence and relation to mental health are scarce. \nMethods: We conducted a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey in Australia and New Zealand (N=2640). Sampling was stratified by age, gender, ancestry/ethnicity, region and income. Two pre-registered questions were analysed to explore participants’ engagement in contemplative practices and associations to psychological distress and mental healthcare use. We used posthoc regression analyses to further clarify relationships between variables.\nResults: Overall, 70% of participants engaged in contemplative practices over the past year, most commonly meditation (31%), relaxation (25%), breathing techniques (24%), and yoga (21%). Improving health and wellbeing were the primary motivations for practice. All contemplative practice users reported significantly higher psychological distress and mental healthcare use than non-practitioners (p’s&lt;.05). Adjusting for socio-demographic differences removed associations with distress among yoga and relaxa-tion practitioners (βrelaxation=.02, βyoga=−.03, n.s.). For meditators, the association disap-peared when we accounted for mental healthcare use (βmeditation=.01, n.s.). Breathing practice was associated with increased distress in all models (βbreathing=.04–.11, p’s&lt;.05). Notably, meditators and relaxation practitioners with unmet healthcare needs reported less distress than non-practitioners with unmet needs (dmeditation=0.38, drelaxa-tion=0.35). \nConclusion: Contemplative practices are widespread among Australians and New Zealanders and may play a complementary and/or alternative role in managing mental health. Further research is needed to study their complex associations with mental health, and which types of contemplative practices are beneficial and safe for whom.",

          "abstract": "Social media use has become a near-universal feature of modern life, offering many opportunities for connection and self-presentation. Yet, certain patterns of use have been implicated in poorer psychological outcomes. Further, evidence suggests that individuals with emotion regulation difficulties may be particularly drawn to certain social media behaviours as a means of coping with distress. The present study aimed to examine whether emotion regulation difficulties predict patterns of social media use and, in turn, symptoms of depression and anxiety. We examined four distinct types of social media use: (1) image management-based, (2) social comparison-based, (3) negative engagement-based, and (4) passive consumption-based. Sampling 548 adults aged 18 to 84 years (Mage = 33.16, SD = 17.37; 401 (73.2%) female; 128 (23.2%) male), we tested a structural equation model to examine whether the four distinct types of social media use mediated links between difficulties in emotion regulation at Time 1 and depression and anxiety symptomology at Time 2, one week later. Results suggested that, when controlling for age, difficulties in emotion regulation significantly predicted all types of social media use and symptoms of depression and anxiety over one week. Only comparison-based social media use predicted anxiety symptoms over time, with no other types of social media use significantly predicting these symptoms. The model explained 50.1% of the variance in depression symptoms and 52.1% of the variance in anxiety symptoms. Taken together, these findings suggest the critical importance of emotion regulation over and above social media use in shaping mental health.",

          "abstract": "This study tested whether Members of Parliament (MPs) in the United Kingdom misread public support for climate policies and whether this perception gap can be corrected. Given MPs’ central role in shaping policy direction, underestimation of public support for climate action could carry serious consequences for climate progress and for representative democracy, but remains understudied. In an online survey–experiment with current MPs (N=100), participants’ estimated support for four climate policies under both neutral and cost-salient descriptions were compared with nationally representative polling. MPs significantly underestimated public support, and underestimated public willingness to accept financial impacts of climate policies. This study also offered novel evidence that MPs exaggerated partisan polarisation and formed significantly larger underestimation of support among Conservative voters. Offering original evidence of Spiral of Silence in Parliament, lower perceived support was associated with lower willingness to advocate for a pricing policy. Results indicated significantly larger underestimation of public support in politicians opposed to a climate policy, but even supportive politicians underestimate on average. Bayesian estimation suggested a moderate effect of a norm-based intervention on underestimation reduction, although results were inconclusive under frequentist tests. These findings suggest that misperceptions of others’ preferences within Parliament are structured in a way that can actively discourage climate advocacy, by presenting public opinion on climate policy as weaker and more polarised than it is. By highlighting gaps between public demand and elite perception, the study identifies a tractable barrier to climate action and democratic responsiveness.",

How such beliefs form or change across the lifespan is largely unknown, although theory suggests that beliefs become more negative after disruptive events. The COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity to test whether dramatic world changes and personal adversity affect beliefs. \nMETHOD: In a longitudinal, quasi-experimental, pre-registered design, 529 US participants (51% female, 76% White) provided ratings of primals before and several months after pandemic onset, and information about personal adversity (e.g., losing family, financial hardship). Data was compared to 398 participants without experience of the pandemic. \nRESULTS: The average person in our sample showed no change in 23 of the 26 primals, including Safe, in response to the early pandemic, and only saw the world as slightly less Alive, Interactive, and Acceptable. Higher adversity, however, was associated with slight declines in some beliefs. One limitation is that participants were exclusively American. \nCONCLUSION: Primals were remarkably stable during the initial shock wrought by a once-in-a-century pandemic, supporting a view of primals as stable lenses through which people interpret the world.",

However, when later events cue retrievals of earlier events that also enable integrative encoding, memory for the earlier event can be enhanced (retroactive facilitation). Two experiments using continuous A-B, A-C paired-associate tasks examined retroactive memory effects across lags and retention intervals. We indexed study-phase retrieval and integrative encoding by examining associations between awareness of changes and memory for first responses. Participants studied A-B, A-C, and retention-interval-matched A-B pairs and indicated when they detected response changes. The lag between A-B and A-C and the retention interval between A-C and test trials varied factorially across 4, 16, and 48 intervening items. Cued-recall test formats differed: Experiment 1 prompted direct retrieval of first responses, with participants reporting recollected changes. Experiment 2 used modified-modified free recall in which participants reported responses as they came to mind and indicated whether they were the first, second, or only responses; the first two decisions indicated recollection of changes. Both experiments showed the greatest retroactive facilitation at the longest retention interval and intermediate lag. Retroactive facilitation co-occurred with and was statistically associated with detection and recollection of changes, suggesting these processes contributed to the observed effect. Negatively curvilinear, non-monotonic lag functions occurred for A-B, A-C recall at the longest retention interval and were associated with detected changes, especially those not recollected. These findings may be accounted for by a memory-for-change framework with a role for contextual variability that determines study-phase retrieval success.",

And how does the transcriptional state relate to the maintenance and recall of the long-term memory?  To answer these questions we have been systematically tracing the time-course of transcriptional changes evoked by long-term sensitization in the marine mollusk Aplysia californica.  Our approach captures transcriptional changes in neurons of known behavioral relevance using a within-subjects design, delineating patterns of transcriptional change that are comprehensive and reproducible.  We have previously reported that within 1 day of long-term sensitization training there is a widespread transcriptional response involving robust changes in over 5% of tested transcripts (1,252 of ~22k; Conte, 2017).  Within 1 week, however, memory strength fades and nearly all transcriptional changes relapse to baseline (Perez, 2018).  Here we report microarray analysis (N = 16) of transcriptional changes 5 days post-learning, a time-point when memory strength has weakened but is still robust.  Remarkably, we find that at this intermediate behavioral stage nearly all transcriptional changes have fully decayed, even in subsets of animals that have shown very little forgetting.  Thus, most transcriptional changes seem to decay more rapidly than memory expression.  We discuss several possible ways that memory expression could become decoupled from detectable transcriptional regulation.",

Using data from 27,000 participants across 27 countries, items were selected from the VIA Inventory of Strengths using Ant Colony Optimization to maximize cross-cultural measurement invariance. The resulting Big Three-Mini demonstrated metric invariance across all but one country comparison and scalar invariance across nearly half of them. Exploratory analyses using World Values Survey indicators revealed meaningful associations between the Big Three-Mini dimensions and national well-being.

          "abstract": "A necessary prerequisite for the accumulation of beneficial knowledge, aka cumulative cultural evolution, is the sharing of information via social learning. Yet little work in the field of cultural evolution has examined the mechanisms that support information sharing in the face of exploitative information free-riding and information hoarding. We ran a series of online interactive experiments (N = 716) combined with computational reinforcement and social learning models to test whether the mechanism of reputation-based partner choice can effectively support information sharing. Participants in groups chose whether to engage in costly innovation, and whether to share the resultant knowledge. Sharers received increased reputations for sharing, and participants could use reputations to select recipients of knowledge. Study 1 found, in participants from the UK and China, high levels of information sharing but only weak partner choice. Study 2 replicated this finding with various methodological improvements. Study 3 showed that participants used partner choice to exclude non-sharing artificial bots from receiving information. Study 4 found that when partner choice was not possible, preferences for information sharing declined to comparable levels as non-sharing. Overall, our findings provide tentative positive experimental evidence that partner choice can facilitate information sharing and enable cumulative cultural evolution.",

          "abstract": "Affective valence and reinforcement learning (RL) are increasingly recognized to be closely connected, yet the exact nature of their relationship remains unclear. Here, we investigated how RL-related computations contribute to affective valence and how affective valence contributes to RL. Applying an original computational method, we found that affective experience during RL is best explained by a combination of three prominent theoretical perspectives: valence is determined by reward, prediction errors, and counterfactual comparisons. To account for these findings, we hypothesized that the valence of affective responses represents (i.e., encodes, tracks) the value of the eliciting stimulus, and contributes to RL alongside reward per se. We confirmed this hypothesis across three RL tasks, showing that decision-makers prefer choice options associated with more positive affect in addition to preferring options associated with greater reward. Altogether, our results establish a unifying model of the valence-RL relationship with key implications for the mechanisms of affective experience and human RL. Moreover, they validate a powerful new computational framework for future research on these topics.",

          "authors": "Steven Verheyen; Tom Heyman",
          "abstract": "Open science (OS) practices are increasingly integrated into undergraduate psychology curricula. While OS can enhance students’ scientific literacy, engagement, and attitudes toward research, its teaching also introduces challenges. This narrative review synthesizes published experiences and recommendations concerning OS education for undergraduate psychology students, identifying common pitfalls and strategies to mitigate them. Eleven pitfalls were identified: the overwhelming variety of OS practices, high technical demands, substantial time investment, insufficient support, perceived competitive disadvantage, potential disengagement, worries about public mistakes, inconsistencies between teaching and practice, risks of academic misconduct, erosion of trust in science, and inclusivity concerns. To address these challenges, educators are encouraged to scaffold learning through replication and preregistration exercises, create authentic assignments, foster collaboration and student authorship, increase feedback literacy and epistemic humility, embed OS across the curriculum, and pay attention to inclusivity. We conclude that teaching OS to undergraduates is both feasible and valuable, provided educators anticipate its challenges and make deliberate pedagogical choices. Viewing OS as a buffet of practices rather than a prescriptive set of rules can help align educational choices with course goals and student readiness. The availability of open educational resources and international teaching communities further supports the integration of OS into undergraduate psychology education, allowing students to experience firsthand the benefits of transparency, collaboration, and rigorous scientific practice.",

          "abstract": "Many perceptions, thoughts, and emotions occur consciously.  But many others occur without being conscious.  Higher-order (HO) theories of consciousness seek to explain how mental states that are conscious differ from those that are not.  That would tell us what it is for a mental state to be conscious.  All HO theories rest on the commonsense observation that whenever a mental state is conscious, one is in some way aware of being in that state.  So they see awareness of being in a mental state as a necessary condition for that state to be conscious.  The reliance on this condition distinguishes HO theories from other theories of consciousness.  There are several versions of a HO theory, which differ mainly in how they explain our awareness of mental states when those states are conscious.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Pervasive evidence supports consistent associations between trait self-control and health behavior, yet few studies have tested the underlying mechanisms. We leveraged meta-analytically synthesized data from the extant research to test a mediational model specifying indirect effects of trait self-control on health behavior mediated by social cognition theory constructs and intention as a candidate mechanism. We also tested effects of moderators on model effects: behavior control process (impulsive vs. reflective), behavior type, trait self-control and behavior measure type, and measurement lag. Method: Studies reporting relations among trait self-control, social cognition constructs (attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control), intention, and health behavior were identified in a systematic database search. Our proposed model was fit to the pooled correlation matrix among these variables using multilevel meta-analytic structural equation modeling. Results: Findings supported model predictions including indirect effects of trait self-control on health behavior directed through attitude, perceived behavioral control, and intentions, and a residual direct effect indicating partial mediation. Moderator analysis revealed larger direct and indirect trait self-control-health behavior effects in studies targeting behaviors under impulsive process control relative to those under reflective control. Analyses of behavior type, behavior and self-control measure type and measurement lag moderators did not reveal systematic variation in model effects. Conclusion: Findings provide preliminary support for the model signaling a candidate mechanism for trait self-control-health behavior relations and providing prior effect size and variability estimates that could be expected in future studies. Impulse-related behaviors represent a key moderating condition that magnifies trait self-control-behavior effects.",

Our analysis includes tweets from the U.S., East and West European NATO countries, Ukraine, and Russia. Tweet volume spiked initially but stabilized by week ten. Results show that anger consistently exceeded fear across all regions, indicating that the conflict primarily evoked mobilizing rather than paralyzing emotional responses. Russia showed substantially lower levels of both emotions than other regions, while no significant differences emerged among the U.S., NATO countries, and Ukraine despite their varying proximity to the conflict. This analysis offers a nuanced understanding of how fear and anger shape regional emotional responses to ongoing international conflict.",

Here we investigate naturally occurring memory distortions using the largest known dataset of narrative recall, comprising hundreds of spoken recollections. Using large language models (LLMs), we developed an automated pipeline to detect and classify spontaneous false memories. Across two validation experiments, we demonstrate that human-AI agreement matches inter-human reliability in detecting and cataloging memory distortions. We show that false memories reflect two distinct phenomena which are driven by separable semantic factors: similarity to prototypical narrative patterns drives factual errors (distortions of actual content), whereas contextual surprise drives confabulations (entirely fabricated details). Through this combination of large-scale naturalistic data and AI-powered automation tools, we reveal memory processes that controlled laboratory paradigms cannot easily capture and illuminate the complex dynamics of human (mis)remembering in real-world contexts.",

          "authors": "Katarina Kliit; Uku Vainik; René Mõttus",
          "abstract": "Relatively stable personality traits shape people’s motivations and attitudes, and their potential effect on pro-environmental attitudes and resulting behaviours can accumulate over time. However, narrow personality traits—nuances that tend to provide stronger and more refined associations with various outcomes—have received little attention in relation to pro-environmental attitudes. Furthermore, research has almost exclusively focused on self-reports that are prone to biases. This suggests that the associations between personality traits and pro-environmental attitudes have likely been underestimated. We collected participants' self- and informant-reports of narrow personality nuances and broad Big Five domains from three samples (Estonian, N = 20,926; Russian, N = 762; English, N = 600). This allowed us to estimate their true correlation (rtrue) with and predictive accuracy (rtruepred) for pro-environmental attitudes, while controlling for single-method, occasion-specific, and random errors and estimating the findings’ generalizability. The rtrues were higher than self-reports-based correlations, and nuances had larger effect sizes than domains. In the largest sample, the Openness (rtrue = .35) and Agreeableness domains (rtrue = .27) had the highest rtrues with pro-environmental attitudes. However, a range of nuances had even stronger rtrues , primarily those reflecting progressive views, care for other people, and appreciation of art. The combined predictive accuracy of nuances for pro-environmental attitudes reached nearly rtruepred = .60, even with only three “top” nuances; the domains’ predictive accuracy was lower (rtruepred = .50). The findings replicated well across samples and suggest that pro-environmental attitudes are linked with personality traits more strongly and in more nuanced ways than previously thought.",

When we face our social partners, what is upright to one person might be upside down to the other, and what is on one’s left would be the other’s right. In five experiments (N = 318), we investigated whether 3- to 4-year-old children appreciate others’ distinct visual experiences when engaged in social actions. Specifically, we presented children with pictures and books that were initially upright to them, and we asked children to show those pictures and books to people who faced the children (i.e., whose perspectives on the pictures and books were opposite those of the children). Across experiments, we found that young children spontaneously oriented pictures and books so that those objects appeared upright to their social partners. Whereas classic research suggests that young children are egocentric, these findings suggest that young children are sensitive to the visual experiences of their social partners. These findings support the possibility that, from early in development, children engage in mental state reasoning to better cooperate with and communicate to their social partners.",

          "abstract": "We examined sex and birth cohort differences in the magnitude of genetic and environmental influence on childhood and adolescent conduct problems in 293 same-sex and 100 opposite-sex adult twin pairs (aged 15-67 years) who were recruited on the basis of one or both twins' participation in a treatment program for Alcohol Use Disorder. The results suggested common genetic influences underlying alcohol abuse/dependence and antisocial behavior. In addition, cotwins of female probands reported more conduct problems than cotwins of male probands, suggesting that affected females both require and transmit a higher liability for antisocial behavior than do affected males. Despite sex differences for liability and -- to some extent -- in the relative magnitude of genetic and environmental influences, the specific genetic and environmental influences on conduct problems appeared to be the same in both sexes. Analyses ignoring birth cohort suggested that twin similarity for childhood and adolescent conduct problems was due mainly to genetic influences with minimal shared environmental influences. In contrast, birth cohort differences were found for the number of conduct problems reported, as well as for the genetic and shared environmental influences underlying these problems. Genetic influences were of greater magnitude in older cohorts, whereas shared environmental influences were of considerable magnitude only in younger cohorts. These findings suggest that secular trends in societal factors (e.g., increased poverty, community violence, and substance abuse in more recent generations) may have resulted in specific shared environmental influences that increase the similarity for antisocial behavior among family members differing in genetic liability.",

          "abstract": "Fairness is a fundamental social norm guiding human decision-making. Yet much of our empirical understanding of fairness-related choices are derived from controlled laboratory studies with homogenous student samples, raising concerns about the ecological validity of experimental findings. Here, we tackle this challenge by introducing a citizen science, lab-in-the-field approach, embedding a classic fairness paradigm, the Ultimatum Game (UG), in a well-visited public space within a community: a museum. Over the course of 13 months, we recorded &gt;18,672 decisions from a heterogenous sample of volunteer members of the public. Each participant responded to four allocation offers from an anonymous proposer (two generous, two selfish), with the option to view proposers’ past behaviour (previously generous vs. selfish), before deciding whether to accept or reject each offer. Results closely replicated classic UG effects, with unfair offers frequently rejected, confirming the presence of inequality aversion beyond the laboratory. Notably, the majority of participants chose to sample proposer-history information, and those who did showed heightened sensitivity to fairness violations, demonstrating that judgements of unfairness are shaped by expectations which emerge from voluntary information sampling. Furthermore, the ecologically enriched design helped uncover temporal and demographic patterns, namely an association between time-of-day and information-seeking behaviour, and an increased willingness to accept unfairness across age. By situating a foundational experimental paradigm in a community venue, our methodological approach provides a scalable model for studying decision-making in ecologically enhanced contexts and a framework for examining authentic behaviours beyond the laboratory, ultimately helping to deepen our understanding of the crucial norms that shape society.",

          "authors": "Ingo Landwehr; Katrin Landwehr; Alexander F. Schmidt",
          "abstract": "In a pilot study using mouse tracking, men’s interpretation and weighting of global sexual (e.g., clothing style) and specific affective (e.g., facial expression) cues when judging women’s flirting intentions depended on two factors: (1) whether the men were sexually aroused and (2) whether the women’s sexual and affective cues were congruent or incongruent. Both reaction time (RT) and error rate (ER) emerged as significant indicators of men’s overreliance on global cues (OGC) in the context of sexual flirting, as evidenced by their positive correlations with self-report trait measures of interpersonally problematic (e.g., disinhibited, exploitative) sexuality. In the present study, we sought to replicate these findings in a substantially larger sample, using a simplified key-press paradigm and focusing solely on RT and ER as dependent variables. In a preregistered online study with heterosexual men (N = 284), experimentally induced sexual arousal again increased the likelihood of OGC as a function of task difficulty, i.e., the (in)congruence between global sexual and specific affective cues displayed by a potential female flirting partner. While the main and interaction effects were replicated and a meaningful pattern of correlations emerged between the experimental measures and self-report measures of dispositional risk factors for sexually problematic behavior, a somewhat different moderation pattern by these individual differences was observed. Taken together, the simplified paradigm proved largely successful and appears promising for diagnostic applications in forensic and clinical contexts.",

However, we identified significant same-day positive associations, namely, on days when individuals engaged in PB, they also showed higher than usual levels of PEB. Additionally, we found positive carryover effects in both PB and PEB, suggesting that young adults are likely to persist in their daily prosocial and pro-environmental efforts. No significant cross-level interaction between self-transcendence values and the spillover effect from PB to PEB was found.\nConclusion: The findings provide new insights into young adults’ daily engagement in prosocial and pro-environmental behaviors, highlighting the role of day-to-day within-person changes, while accounting for stable, between-person differences in behavioral and motivational tendencies.\nKeywords: Pro-environmental behavior, Prosocial behavior; Young adults; Experience Sampling Methods; Spillover; Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling.",

This meta-analysis examined mental disorder prevalences among older adults post-hazard and compared them to younger populations.\nMethods: PRISMA guidelines were followed. We systematically searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science for epidemiological studies published from inception to October 2024. Eligible studies focused on ICD-/DSM-based mental disorders ≥1 month post-hazard and reported prevalence estimates or odds ratio (OR) for age-related differences in prevalences (i.e., in adults ≥60 years vs. &lt;60 years). Random-effects models were used for all analyses.\nResults: Thirty-eight studies (N = 29,342 older adults; N = 41,575 younger adults) were included. PTSD prevalence in older adults was 17.43% (95% CI [8.48%; 32.48%], k = 8, I2 = 97.10%) in the first year post-hazard and 10.07% (95% CI [6.32%; 17.45%], k = 14, I2 = 96.10%) in long-term assessments (range 15 months to 17 years). MDD prevalence (combined across time points) was 4.70% (95% CI [1.76; 12.00], k = 7, I2 = 92.60%). Older adults were not significantly more likely than younger adults to meet PTSD criteria in the first year post-hazard (OR = 1.22, 95% CI [0.80, 1.84], k = 12, p = .324, I2 = 70.00%) or in its long-term aftermath (OR = 1.24, 95% CI [76.38, 2.04], k = 9, I2 = 73.50%, p = .329). Heterogeneity was substantial across all analyses (I2 &gt; 70%). Data for MDD-related comparisons were limited, and information on other mental disorders than PTSD and MDD in this population was scarcely reported.\nConclusions: PTSD and MDD prevalences were elevated in older adults post-hazard but similar to younger adults. More research is needed on other mental disorders and age-related moderators of post-disaster mental health.",

          "abstract": "The Identity Vitality-Pathology (IVP) model is a novel theoretical framework that conceptualizes a modifiable health-determining construct, identity state, defined by three domains hypothesized to all stem from identification of the core self with the physical body: 1) a self-concept that is inclusive of all living beings vs. exclusive based on physical attributes, 2) the perceived basis of the worth of all living beings as intrinsic vs. extrinsic, and 3) the degree of universally compassionate orientation toward all living beings. The identity state construct is theorized to act through modulating stressor appraisal and stress-responsive behavior to influence the causal relationship between social position-dependent stressors, biological aging, and age-related diseases. The IVP Scale (IVPS) was developed to empirically assess the hypotheses of the IVP framework and the utility of the identity state construct for population health research. This study provides the first description of the psychometric properties of the long (20-item) and short form (12-item) IVPS. We used exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA and CFA) of data from two separate samples of self-identified Black and White adults (aged 18-81) collected in 2021 and 2025 (total N=2,318). Associations between the IVPS and related constructs of optimism and resilience were examined to establish construct validity. EFA supported a unidimensional structure and CFA confirmed good model fit for both IVPS measures. Both scales are significantly positively correlated with indicators of optimism and resilience and significantly negatively correlated with social dominance orientation. These initial findings suggest the IVPS-20 and the IVPS-Short are valid and psychometrically sound scales.",

          "abstract": "Communication with artificial agents (e.g., animated characters in virtual reality, social robots) is becoming increasingly common. Understanding how to design these agents&apos; behaviours to best support social interactions is therefore essential. One key communicative behaviour that supports human-human interactions is eye gaze, which can signal an agent&apos;s focus of attention, goals, and intentions to interact. Previous research has demonstrated that beliefs about whether an agent is human- or artificially controlled influence the perceived significance of gaze at subjective, behavioural, and neurophysiological levels. The present study specifically examined how these beliefs shape the evaluation of gaze dynamics as signals of an agent&apos;s communicative intent---an essential process for recognising and responding to communication opportunities. Participants (n = 160) completed a semi-interactive online task with a virtual agent that displayed dynamic gaze sequences. In each trial, we manipulated whether eye contact was established and whether the agent looked at the same object twice. Participants decided whether the agent was communicating a request for assistance to access an object or privately inspecting it. Across two task blocks, we also manipulated whether participants believed the agent was human- or AI-controlled. We found that believing the agent to be human-controlled increased perceived communicativeness when gaze cues were ambiguous, but this effect was attenuated in the second block of the experiment. This pattern may reflect a learned adjustment specific to the experimental setup that involved relatively consistent agent behaviour. Nevertheless, subjective ratings indicated a preference for human- over AI-modelled data.

          "authors": "Joshua D. Wright",
          "abstract": "Categorizing oneself as a member of a group involves merging ones’ sense of self with the group, such that the self becomes an interchangeable exemplar of the social category (Turner et al., 1987) and self-interest and ingroup interests become interchangeable (Brewer, 2010). Because of this, social identification is associated with ingroup favoritism and behaviors that support the ingroup (Brewer, 1999; Brown, 2000). However, we suggest that some of the variance generally explained by social identification may be better explained by the concept of psychological ownership—feelings of ownership for place (Verkuyten &amp; Martinović, 2017), which implies the right to control use or access (Furby, 1978). In Study 1, I demonstrate the empirical distinction between social identification and psychological ownership and demonstrate that psychological ownership of the South is a better predictor of positive attitudes toward the Confederate battle flag than Southern identification. In Study 2, I provide further evidence of the empirical distinction between social identification and psychological ownership and demonstrate that psychological ownership of the United States is a better predictor of intentions to purchase American-made versus foreign-made products than is national identification.",

          "abstract": "Successful task-switching performance is thought to rely on inhibitory mechanisms suppressing no-longer-relevant tasks, indexed by the n–2 repetition cost. Recent work has shown that episodic retrieval contributes to this cost, confounding estimates of inhibition. This study examines age-related differences in the contributions of inhibition and episodic retrieval to the n–2 repetition cost using a paradigm that controls episodic interference. We also applied the drift diffusion model (DDM) to estimate latent processes underlying these effects. Results showed robust n–2 repetition costs for younger and older adults in response times which reduced when episodic interference was controlled. However, only younger adults showed this pattern in error rates. The DDM showed n–2 repetition costs and their modulation by episodic retrieval were isolated to drift rates, reflecting changes in evidence accumulation. Only younger adults' drift rates were affected by episodic retrieval, with n–2 repetition costs reduced under episodic match conditions. Older adults showed n–2 repetition costs in drift rate regardless of episodic match, suggesting age-related differences in episodic retrieval at the latent level. The results provide insight into age-related differences in inhibition, the importance of controlling episodic retrieval effects in task switching, and the value of computational modelling in revealing age-related differences.",

          "abstract": "To enable human living within planetary boundaries is among the biggest challenges of our time. In this context the question emerges how consuming less can go along with subjective wellbeing. Analysing meaning construction of pro-environmental behaviour might offer insights regarding this relationship. Based on the hierarchical model of meaning the current study aimed to investigate meaning construction of behaviours that mitigate resource consumption which we call sufficiency behaviour. Therefore, we analyzed survey data with N = 544 participants. Path-analysis revealed intrinsic motivation for repairing, curtailment and sharing to be related to hedonic wellbeing and behaviour frequency mediated by ascribed behavioural meaning. Intrinsic motivation did partially regress on altruistic and biospheric values. We found no significant relationship between sufficiency behaviour and life satisfaction or presence of meaning in life. We conclude that finding meaning in behaviour is important for behaviour frequency as well as experienced behavioural wellbeing. Choosing alternatives to buying new products seems to be perceived as meaningful when it is intrinsically motivated. Biospheric and altruistic values might constitute sources for the intrinsic motivation to develop. Taken together, these results illustrate how less consumption might positively connect to wellbeing. Future research should explore ways how meaningfulness of sufficiency behaviour can be fostered.",

          "abstract": "Precise norm scores are essential for psychological diagnostics. While conventional norming estimates norms based on subgroups, continuous norming uses regression to estimate norms based on the entire sample. One consequence of this is that continuous norming achieves a comparable precision with smaller sample sizes compared to conventional norming. However, clear guidelines on the required sample sizes for continuous norming are scarce. To provide empirically based guidance for determining required sample sizes in normative studies using continuous norming, we used normative data from two intelligence tests to evaluate the precision of continuous norms across various sample sizes, norm predictor values, and latent trait levels. Results show that continuous norms can achieve similar precision as conventional norms with substantially smaller samples (N = 1,000–1,500 vs. N = 2,500–3,000). However, precision declines at extreme percentiles and norm predictor values, emphasizing the need to tailor sample size planning to the specific test.",

          "abstract": "A central feature of consciousness is the association between external events and subjective experiences of content. These experiences range from low level (detection) to high level (identification). For example, a visual experience may range from seeing something on a computer screen (detection) to seeing the digit 3 (identification). In research, neural processes that correlate with these experiences are called neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs). In vision, a candidate NCC is the visual awareness negativity (VAN) that is derived from event-related potentials, occurring about 200 ms after stimulus onset over posterior electrode sites. Previous research suggests that VAN is more sensitive to low-level experiences (detection) than high-level experiences (identification). Because previous results are limited, two preregistered experiments were conducted. In both experiments, two separate staircases continuously adjusted stimulus opacity to either detection- or identification thresholds. Detection awareness referred to experiencing something rather than nothing. Identification awareness referred to experiencing the identity of the stimulus rather than not experiencing its identity. Experiment 1 (N = 30) showed that VAN was similarly sensitive to detection awareness and identification awareness. This was shown for a digit task and for a letter task. Experiment 2 (N = 28) used the same digit task as in Experiment 1 with two stimulus sizes. Results found identification VAN for both digit sizes, and VAN was unaffected by stimulus size. These results confirm the sensitivity of VAN to both low-level experiences (detection) and high-level experiences (identification). However, results emphasize the limited specificity of VAN in separating between low-level and high-level experiences, suggested by the similarity of VAN in both conditions.",

Practitioners who had\npublished in peer reviewed journals and/or presented at Association for Contextual\nBehavioral Science conferences on CB supervision in the last 20 years were invited to take\npart in a Delphi study to find consensus: 20 participants provided responses to an open-ended\nonline questionnaire on CB supervision. A reflexive thematic analysis, within a qualitative\nresearch design, was used to interpret common ideas and themes within the data. Through\nanalysis, four main themes were generated: contextual factors, tasks and behaviors,\nsupervision qualities, and supervision purposes. A further round to find consensus was then\nconducted, with participants providing ratings of statements based on these themes in an\nonline survey. Consensus ratings indicated that functional analysis and experiential learning\nmethods appeared to be central to the practice of CB supervision. Overall, participants\ndescribed features of CB supervision, which were both consistent with existing ideas on CB\nsupervision and contextual behavioral science, as well as clinical supervision more broadly.\nThe results serve to inform future research in the area.",

          "abstract": "Cultivated meat is an emerging food innovation with the potential to transform food systems, raising important ethical, social, and sustainability considerations. Including consumer perspectives is essential to understand which cultivated meat attributes drive acceptance and satisfaction, highlighting the need to study specific products rather than the category as a whole. This study presents the first exploratory application of the widely validated Kano model to explore consumer classification of seven key cultivated meat products’ attributes, their impact on satisfaction, and potential differences across dietary groups.   Two products were examined: a cultivated burger and cultivated foie gras, including a willingness-to-try assessment using realistic product images provided by companies. A total of 107 conference attendees representing diverse nationalities and dietary patterns participated. Results indicate that attribute classification differs both within and across products. Price and protein content emerged as attractive attributes for all consumers. Taste parity was valued mainly by meat-eaters for the more familiar burger, while vegan labelling was considered one-dimensional by non-meat-eaters, especially vegans. No must-be attributes were identified, suggesting consumer expectations for cultivated meat are not yet fully formed. Attributes such as appearance resemblance, country of origin, and those drawing policy attention, like labelling products as “meat” or “foie gras”, were largely perceived as indifferent. These findings underscore the product and consumer- specific nature of cultivated meat acceptance \nand the value of incorporating consumer perspectives early in product development. The Kano model proved effective in classifying attributes, providing insights for both theoretical understanding and practical decision-making in this innovative sector.",

          "abstract": "Background\nPsychiatric disorders are associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour. The effect of pharmacological treatments on suicide-related outcomes is inconsistent. Although the main approach to evaluate effectiveness, randomised controlled trials may not provide externally valid results for suicide prevention in psychiatric populations. We aimed to synthesise the evidence and assess the medication effects on suicide outcomes from observational studies.\nMethods\nWe systematically searched eight databases from database inception to March 2025 for pharmacoepidemiological and other observational studies on suicide-related outcomes in people treated with the main types of psychotropic medications. We included primary studies involving adults with psychiatric diagnoses who were prescribed medication and a comparison sample with the same diagnosis without prescribed medication (between-individual studies) or the same individuals during a non-prescription period (within-individual studies). We excluded studies that did not report psychiatric diagnoses and selected samples (such as inpatients only). Outcomes were any suicide-related behaviour (self-harm, attempted suicide) and suicide mortality. We pooled effect sizes as odds ratios (OR), hazard ratios (HR) or risk ratios (RR) using random-effects models and assessed study quality. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42024515794.\nFindings\nWe identified 47 independent studies from 13 countries based on more than 6 million people (46.6% male). Across main diagnostic categories and 70 individual medications examined, strongest associations with suicide risks were found for second generation antipsychotics in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (OR range 0.35 to 0.75), lithium and divalproex/valproic acid in bipolar disorder (OR range 0.26 to 1.03), and SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants in depression (OR range 0.47-0.78). Benzodiazepines were associated with higher suicide risks in all diagnostic categories (OR range 1.57-5.47). There was evidence for publication bias for SSRIs in depression, leading to more papers reporting higher risks of suicide-related outcomes.\nInterpretation\nObservational studies suggest a role for psychotropic medication for suicide prevention in certain psychiatric disorders.",

The emotion category model, particularly sadness and disappointment, was consistently associated with neural event boundaries across the cortical hierarchy from early sensory areas to transmodal hubs in the default mode network, and aligned with behavioral segmentation at coarser temporal scales. These effects persisted after controlling for low- and high-level non-emotional features, underscoring the unique predictive value of emotion categories. Social salience cues, such as “collective presence,” also robustly predicted boundaries, suggesting complementary roles of emotional and social information. Our findings highlight the correspondence between category-specific emotional semantics and narrative structure across multiple timescales.",

          "abstract": "This article is a conceptual partial replication of the study by Decristan et al. (2022), which investigated the importance of individual and classroom characteristics for students' social integration in secondary mathematics classrooms. The original study showed that performance anxiety in mathematics was negatively related to subjective social integration and that performance self-concept and constructive support from teachers were positively related to social integration. Finally, it was shown that classroom characteristics could moderate these relationships. Teacher support was particularly important for the social integration of students with high achievement anxiety, and to a lesser extent, for the integration of students with low self-concept of mathematics ability. This study replicates and extends these findings. Using data from the IQB Trends in Education Study 2018, in which approximately 44,000 German ninth graders were surveyed, factors related to the operationalization of the constructs were identified that affect the replicability of the original study in this dataset. For this purpose, the replication study used different related measures for the concepts from the original study. Patterns in the effect sizes were identified using exploratory multiverse analyses. Across all analyses, a pattern of results comparable to the original study emerged for the main effects, albeit with smaller effect sizes. The interaction effect from the original study could not be replicated. Reasons for differences between original and replication study were mainly the operationalization of the construct of social integration. We discuss the value of replication studies and how multiverse analyses can be used to speed up the process of knowledge development.",

          "abstract": "Researchers analyzing intensive longitudinal data often aim to detect between-group differences in dynamics of psychological constructs, such as positive and negative affect. These constructs are usually latent (not directly observable). To validly compare groups of individuals in their dynamic processes, the latent constructs must be measured equally across the individuals. If this is not the case – that is, if measurement invariance is violated for some items – this partial non-invariance must be accounted for. Otherwise, the group-specific estimates of the dynamic process may be biased. To aid researchers in obtaining unbiased group-specific estimates despite partial measurement non-invariance, we present an extension of the Three-Step Latent Vector Autoregression, a novel method that separates the estimation of the measurement model and the structural model. We expand this method to multi-group modeling, where differences in structural parameters (e.g., regression coefficients) are captured by allowing these parameters to vary across the groups of individuals. Measurement heterogeneity between and within these groups is captured by group- or person-specific MM parameters. Through two simulation studies, we demonstrate that the method performs well in obtaining correct estimates of a dynamic process despite the presence of measurement heterogeneity. The method is further illustrated with an empirical example.",

          "abstract": "Self-other relationship is a fundamental component in shaping an individual’s mind and health. Two principal components of self-other relationship can be distinguished. Intersubjectivity comprises empathy and other relational phenomena, whereas subjectivity includes an intrapersonal sense of agency and identity. In this study, we aim to evaluate how individual differences in both intrapersonal and intersubjective traits influence the quality of friendship and the experience of loneliness. We hypothesize that the quality of friendships and the experience of loneliness arise not only from interpersonal factors, but also from distinct intrapersonal features of the individual. We administered a set of psychometric questionnaires to a random sample of non-clinical, young adults. Outcome variables concerned personal experiences of friendship and loneliness. Factor analysis was employed to confirm the duality of latent intrapersonal and intersubjective factors. The results confirmed that the intrapersonal factor has an important influence on the sociability of healthy young adults, independent of intersubjective factors and lockdown-related changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A low sense of agency together with high psychotic-like experiences and schizotypal traits strongly predicted less friendships and more loneliness. A mediation analysis further showed that the effect of intrapersonal traits on loneliness was partially mediated by the participants’ friendships. Our results emphasize a central role of self-concept for social life quality. These findings further provide a new perspective for individuals in the general population with low social life quality and possible subclinical alterations of self-experience. Finally, our study also brings potential contributions to the prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation strategies for psychopathological conditions associated with both self-disturbances and social deficits.",

However, most theories in decision-making focus on predicting one specific choice type (i.e., choosing the best option). Here, we link decision-making and cognitive-control research to test a theory that accounts for flexible adjustments of choice mechanisms to different goals and demands. Our biologically inspired model specifies how different features translate into evidence for the current goal, and how evidence is mapped onto different output structures. We tested the model in an eye-tracking study in which participants were asked to choose one out of four consumer products or to appraise the entire set, each with respect to positive or negative value. The results confirmed our preregistered hypotheses that response time (RT) should decrease with the overall value of a set of options in choose-best but increase in choose-worst trials. As predicted, this interaction was absent in appraisal RT, which instead exhibited an inverted-U-shaped pattern. Furthermore, the amount of attention devoted to an option was positively related to its value in choose-best, negatively related in choose-worst trials, and unrelated when participants appraised entire sets of products. Time-resolved analyses of eye movements revealed strategic goal-dependent search processes, as attention is increasingly focused on goal-congruent options in choice but remains more uniformly distributed in appraisal. Our findings suggest that cognitive control shapes choice and search dynamics by flexibly adjusting them to current goals and demands.",

Four studies (N = 5,334; three pre-registered) reveal a robust morality-effectiveness disconnect: Behaviors that rank better on objective climate mitigation potential rank worse on perceived morality. This disconnect is mediated by stronger personal support for less effective behaviors, and is weaker among individuals more interested in learning about environmental impacts. Study 3, a five-country experiment, reveals that explicitly labeling behaviors' impact reduces the disconnect by 68%, but does not eliminate it. Study 4 demonstrates that providing detailed information reverses the disconnect, leading people to judge more effective behaviors as proportionally more moral and increasing policy support relative to less effective behaviors.

A critical problem is the omission of adolescents’ perspectives in the development of diagnostic frameworks and questionnaires. Synthesising lived experience evidence can help inform better identification of youth mental health needs.\nMethods: A preregistered systematic search was conducted through Medline: Ovid, Epistemonikos, ProQuest dissertations, Prospero, and Psyarxiv. Systematic reviews were included if they contained qualitative evidence from adolescents (aged 10-24) experiencing the most common clinically-relevant problems (e.g., depression, self-harm). Informed by lived experience expertise, qualitative data were synthesized, including to understand which experiences were transdiagnostic (common across different mental health types). Experiences were also compared to existing questionnaires and reported alongside quality assessment via AMSTAR2.\nOutcomes: Eighteen reviews were synthesized into 30 experiences (subthemes), which were grouped into six themes: social disconnection, behavioural expression, how I relate to the experience, emotional experiences, negative and shifting beliefs of self, and disrupted ability to function. \nInterpretation: This review highlights the need to update existing frameworks and provides initial groundwork for doing so. We argue social indicators should be given more weight, and lived experience evidence also challenged traditional boundaries between symptoms and functioning. Experiences tended to be transdiagnostic, with evidence of dimensionality, overlap between disorders, and new experiences missing from existing frameworks revealed. We make recommendations for research and practice to improve how young people in need are identified and supported.",

Using Reflexive Thematic Analysis, four overarching themes were formulated: (1) Negative Prior Experiences with Mathematics, (2) Misconceptions of Course Content, (3) Fragility and Hypervigilance, and (4) Student-Tutor Interaction. The findings show how early difficulties with mathematics and misaligned expectations about psychology as a discipline undermine fragile confidence when encountering statistical concepts, often resulting in hypervigilance and self-doubt. Tutor communication, class size, and assumptions about baseline competence further shaped students’ experiences, intensifying anxiety.

Of all tested strategies, anthropomorphizing AVs in different modalities, such as adding human-like visual features or human voices, has gained attention. This meta-analysis addresses the role of anthropomorphism in AV trust as a timely response to the ongoing debate. Following PRISMA guidelines, a total of 66 articles and 70 effect sizes, from 5903 participants across seven databases, were included.\nThe results revealed that anthropomorphic interfaces, compared to non-anthropomorphic interfaces, do not significantly improve trust in AVs (Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) = 0.04, not significant). However, in general, adding auditory anthropomorphic features is recommended for increasing trust compared to visual anthropomorphic features (SMD: 0.30 vs. -0.48). Moreover, different levels of anthropomorphism (superficial vs. deep) did not have a significant impact on trust in AVs.  The overall trend indicated that with increasing age of participants, the reliance on anthropomorphic interfaces for increasing trust became more pronounced.\nThis meta-analysis shows that adding human-like features is not a dependable way to build trust in AVs. Future works are needed on how it can be compared to other approaches like explainability. Generally, as a suggestion for stakeholders, it is important to recognize that the impact of anthropomorphic interfaces on trust in AVs is not the same as assumptions.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the coping mechanisms and resilience strategies of Arab-Bedouin in Israel, an ethnic minority facing systemic exclusion and socio-cultural barriers. The research explores their lived experiences within a collectivist and conservative society, addressing the psychological impacts of marginalization and the potential of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) as a personal and communal resilience tool.\nEight Arab-Bedouin mental health professionals (five men, three women) participated in an eight-week MBSR program delivered in Arabic. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews conducted before and after the program. A qualitative approach grounded in thematic analysis was employed to understand participants’ perspectives on mindfulness and its integration into their personal and professional lives.\nPre-program interviews revealed participants’ emotional burdens related to systemic exclusion, racism, and intra-community stereotypes, alongside reliance on family, religious practices, and connection to nature as coping strategies. Post-program findings highlighted improved emotional regulation, reduced reactivity, and greater presence in daily activities through mindfulness practices such as breathing exercises. Participants reported enhanced interpersonal relationships, including improved empathy and communication. While mindfulness was empowering on a personal level, its limitations in addressing systemic inequalities were acknowledged.\nThis study enriches existing literature on mindfulness in marginalized populations, highlighting its potential to empower Arab-Bedouins by fostering resilience and mitigating emotional burdens. Insights from this research underscore the importance of culturally sensitive interventions in supporting both personal and professional well-being in minority communities.",

          "abstract": "Love Island is a popular reality dating series that has faced significant criticism for consistently casting contestants with highly idealized bodies. There has been widespread concern that these casting choices may inadvertently pressure young viewers to internalize unrealistic body ideals and engage in body change strategies to conform to them. However, to date, no longitudinal research has explored this possibility. Using three-wave panel data collected during the 2023 series of Love Island UK (N = 344; M age = 20.42, SD = 1.98), this study examined the reciprocal within-person relationships between body pressure from watching Love Island and engagement in - or desire to engage in - three body change strategies (i.e., weight loss, muscle gain, cosmetic surgery). Nearly all (97.38%) participants reported at least some degree (i.e., M &gt; 1.00) of body pressure from watching Love Island, and fluctuations in body pressure followed a positive developmental trajectory across the series. Body pressure at the midpoint of the series predicted heightened engagement in weight loss and muscle gain strategies, and increased desire for cosmetic surgery, at the end of the series. Furthermore, heightened desire for cosmetic surgery at the beginning of the series predicted increased body pressure during the series. Results therefore suggest that prolonged exposure to highly idealized bodies on Love Island may harm young viewers’ body image, to the point that many feel compelled to alter aspects of their body.",

          "abstract": "Emotions guide human decisions, but whether large language models (LLMs) use emotion similarly remains unknown. We tested this using altruistic third-party punishment, where an observer incurs a personal cost to enforce fairness—a hallmark of human morality and often driven by negative emotion. In a large-scale comparison of 4,068 LLM agents with 1,159 adults across 796,100 decisions, LLMs used emotion to guide punishment, sometimes even more strongly than humans did: Unfairness elicited stronger negative emotion that led to more punishment; punishing unfairness produced more positive emotion than accepting; and critically, prompting self-reports of emotion causally increased punishment. However, mechanisms diverged: LLMs prioritised emotion over cost, enforcing norms in an almost all-or-none manner with reduced cost sensitivity, whereas humans balanced fairness and cost. Notably, reasoning models (o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1) were more cost-sensitive and closer to human behaviour than foundation models (GPT-3.5, DeepSeek-V3), yet remained heavily emotion-driven. These findings provide the first causal evidence of emotion-guided moral decisions in LLMs and reveal deficits in cost calibration and nuanced fairness judgements, reminiscent of early-stage human responses. We propose that LLMs progress along a trajectory paralleling human development; future models should integrate emotion with context‑sensitive reasoning to achieve human-like emotional intelligence.",

          "abstract": "This research investigated how people respond to true and false news, and how the type of social endorsement associated with news posts influences belief and engagement intentions.  Across three experiments (total N = 1084), participants viewed true and false news accompanied by varying levels of positive (likes) and negative (dislikes) endorsement.  Participants were sensitive to post veracity, rating true news as more believable (large effect), and showing greater willingness to like true content, dislike false content and share true content (small effects).  Positive social endorsement by others reliably increased belief, like and share intentions and decreased dislike intentions (small effects).  Negative endorsement reduced belief (Experiment 1) and like intentions and increased dislike intentions (small effects), but had no detectable impact on share intentions.  When negative endorsement was presented alongside high positive endorsement, this reduced belief and like intentions, but only when the negative endorsement level was high, signalling divided opinion.  These findings demonstrate that: 1) veracity has a strong effect on beliefs, and a small effect on engagement and 2) social cues—positive and negative—have a small but significant role in shaping how people evaluate and interact with online news.  Our findings suggest that incorporating a dislike option on social media platforms could improve content evaluation by signalling epistemic rejection, though safeguards may be needed to mitigate risks of misuse.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers a promising cost-effective alternative for assessing public opinion. However, most prior research has focused on simulating individual personas using past surveys, leaving it unclear whether LLMs can accurately estimate out-of-sample public opinion at the societal level. We address this gap with three studies that systematically evaluate the accuracy, bias, and variability of commercial and non-commercial LLMs in inferring societal-level public opinion. First, we evaluated GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on four recent Pew Research Centre polls, finding that both models outperformed traditional baseline methods, with GPT-4 showing higher accuracy, with an error rate ranging from 4% to 9%. Notably, GPT-3.5 produced overly uniform responses characterized by lower variance and higher entropy compared to actual human data, whereas GPT-4’s predictions more closely mirrored real response patterns. Both models, however, exhibited partisan skew, aligning more strongly with Democratic perspectives and underrepresenting Republican viewpoints. Second, we assessed the generalisability of these findings by testing various models (GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4o, and Llama 3.3) on three additional Pew surveys. These models demonstrated similar predictive accuracy and a continued tendency toward less varied responses, though partisan bias was less pronounced in the latest models. Third, we examined the robustness of our findings through ablation studies of prompt design by varying parameters such as temperature, role, and input format and found that the results were consistent across these conditions. Importantly, collective-level estimation consistently outperformed averaged individual-level simulation, which suffered from greater homogeneity bias. Overall, LLMs show strong potential for public opinion estimation, though their inherent biases and methodological limitations warrant careful consideration.",

Existing CCT models have predominantly focused on unidimensional point truths using dichotomous, polytomous, or continuous response formats. However, certain domains such as risk assessment or interpretation of verbal quantifiers may require a consensus focused on intervals, capturing a range of relevant values. We introduce the Interval Consensus Model (ICM), a novel extension of CCT designed to estimate consensus intervals from continuous bounded interval responses. We use a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach to estimate latent consensus intervals. In a simulation study, we show that, under the conditions studied, the ICM performs better than using simple means and medians of the responses. We then apply the model to empirical judgments of verbal quantifiers.",

          "abstract": "Transsaccadic vision is typically described as the ability to retain and integrate visual information across rapid eye movements (saccades) for the purpose of continuous perception. In this review, we break this down further into two fundamental processes: the cortical mechanisms that maintain extrinsic spatial properties (i.e., location, orientation) versus intrinsic identity cues (i.e., spatial frequency, shape) of objects across saccades. First, we summarize the computational problems associated with transsaccadic vision, emphasizing the need to retain and integrate both extrinsic and intrinsic feature information between fixations for predictive vision. Next, we briefly review psychophysical, neurophysiological, stimulation, and neuroimaging evidence that specific cortical mechanisms exist for these processes. Then, we focus on our recent experiments combining functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation-inspired and functional connectivity approaches. These experiments suggest that parietal cortex (specifically, right supramarginal gyrus) contributes to spatial updating of object orientation, whereas dorsomedial occipital cortex (cuneus) supports updating of spatial frequency and object shape. Taken together with the previous literature, this supports the notion that an ‘extended parietal eye field’ is involved in the updating of extrinsic spatial cues, whereas dorsomedial occipital cortex is involved in updating intrinsic cues to object identity, both in communication with the broader functional networks for perception and action. Finally, we synthesize these results in a simple conceptual model for cortical updating and integration of object features and consider the implications for future studies of transsaccadic integration, the ‘binding problem’, and possible clinical applications.",

          "abstract": "Adolescent screen use is highly heterogeneous, varying across dimensions such as activity type, time spent, purpose, and content exposure, with patterns that may persist or shift over time. However, little is known about how such heterogeneity relates to later psychosocial functioning in everyday life. This study addressed this gap by examining longitudinal trajectories of screen time and media content engagement across adolescence and their associations with day-to-day psychosocial functioning in emerging adulthood. Data were drawn from the Zurich Project on Social Development from Childhood to Adulthood (z-proso) and its add-on study, Decades-to-Minutes (D2M), which employed ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Parallel latent class growth analysis modelled trajectories of three screen activities (ages 11,13,15,17) and three types of media content exposure (ages 13,15,17,20) in z-proso (n=1521). Daily psychosocial functioning was assessed in the D2M sample at ages 21 (n=255) and 27 (n=451), and associations with adolescent screen-use trajectories were examined using dynamic structural equation modelling (DSEM). Results showed that youth in the high TV/DVD and chatting/surfing, moderate-content group exhibited higher mean levels and variability of daily aggression and aggressive reactivity. The high-use, high-content group displayed greater daily cannabis use, aggressive reactivity, and provocation inertia. The moderate-use, escalating-content group showed higher stress variability, aggression inertia, aggressive reactivity, and cannabis use. The low-use, low-content group consistently displayed the most adaptive daily functioning. These findings underscore the importance of jointly considering adolescent screen time and media content patterns, given the distinct relations of different joint trajectories to (mal-)adaptive dimensions of psychosocial functioning into adulthood.",

To test these hypotheses one hundred and forty-nine undergraduates were randomly assigned to receive either a 5-day mindfulness training intervention or no training (control). Both groups answered physics questions before and directly after the intervention and rated their confidence, anxiety, and difficulty for each question. Mindfulness training led to a greater increase in confidence and a reduction in anxiety among women and non-binary students, but not for men. The intervention also led to a reduction in judgments of difficulty for all students. The association between mindfulness training and self-reported anxiety among women and non-binary students was mediated by reductions in physics threat (measured mid-week using experience sampling). However, physics threat did not mediate any of the other mindfulness training outcomes for confidence or difficulty. The results are discussed in relation to a model of challenge and threat and mindfulness applications.",

We stacked a brief video intervention highlighting sympathetic personal narratives previously shown to decrease political animosity on a multi-hour event, led by MCC Respectful Conversations, that aims to increase empathy and understanding through guided conversations. The idea is that the video intervention would open people up to the lessons of the event. We tested this in a preregistered pre-test post-test experimental design (N = 209, Events k = 10). Although effects for liking and respect for people with different opinions were in the expected direction (b’s range [.02, .05] across inclusion criteria), they were not typically significantly different from zero (p’s range [.03, .26] across inclusion criteria). We also explored if the events improved people’s attitudes in a one-group pre-test post-test design and found evidence that the overall events may be effective. In summary, we were not able to significantly boost the effects of the intensive treatment with a light touch video treatment. Suggestions for future research are discussed.",

The home literacy environment (HLE) is observed to relate to brain activation during language and reading tasks; however, whether HLE relates to phonological and semantic functional specialization and sensitivity remains unknown. \nMethod: Using an open-source dataset, the present study examined 33 5–6-year-olds and 76 7–8-year-olds. Data from fMRI sound and meaning judgment tasks were used to examine phonological and semantic functional specialization (contrasting tasks) and sensitivity (comparing conditions within a task). Then, voxel-wise regression analyses were used to test correlations between those brain indexes and HLE (i.e., family-to-child reading, child independent reading) measured using a parent survey. \nResults: We observed weak evidence of phonological specialization at 5 years old and weak evidence of semantic specialization at 7 years old associated with family-to-child reading. We also observed weak evidence of phonological sensitivity at 5 years old and strong evidence of semantic sensitivity at 7 years old associated with family-to-child reading. Across the cohorts, a progression from temporal to frontal brain regions was observed in those relations, in line with prior literature on language specialization and sensitivity across development. \nConclusions: Overall, our results suggest that HLE is linked to functional specialization and sensitivity, with a relation of family-to-child reading to processing the sound structure of language at 5 years old and meaning at 7 years old. This finding supports the Interactive Specialization theory, which emphasizes the role of environmental inputs in neural specialization.",

          "abstract": "Perceptual disfluency, induced by blurring or difficult-to-read typefaces, can sometimes enhance memory retention, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate this effect, we manipulated blurring levels (clear, low blur, high blur) during encoding and assessed recognition performance in a surprise memory test. In Experiments 1A and 1B, response latencies from a lexical decision task were analyzed using ex-Gaussian distribution modeling and drift diffusion modeling. Results showed that blurring differentially influenced parameters of the model, with high blur affecting both early and late-stage processes, while low blur primarily influenced early-stage processes. Recognition test results further revealed that high blur words were remembered better than both clear and low blurred words. Experiment 2 employed a semantic categorization task with word frequency manipulation to further examine the locus of the perceptual disfluency effect. Similar to Experiments 1A and 1B, high blur influenced both early and late-stage processes, while low blur primarily affected early-stage processes. Low-frequency words exhibited greater shifting and skewing in distributional parameters, yet only high-frequency, highly blurred words demonstrated an enhanced memory effect. These findings suggest that both early and late cognitive processes contribute to the mnemonic benefits associated with perceptual disfluency. Overall, this study demonstrates that distributional and computational analyses provide powerful tools for dissecting encoding mechanisms and their effects on memory, offering valuable insights into models of perceptual disfluency",

          "abstract": "Background: Ecological momentary interventions targeting transdiagnostic mechanisms are promising for prevention and early intervention, but evidence on their mechanisms of change is very limited.\nObjective: To explore indirect effects of EMIcompass, a transdiagnostic, compassion-focused ecological momentary intervention, on mental health outcomes (i.e., psychological distress, clinical symptoms, quality of life) via candidate mechanisms of change (i.e., stress reactivity, emotional reactivity, threat anticipation, resilience, and aberrant salience) in youth with early mental health problems. \nMethods: We conducted a secondary analysis of an exploratory, assessor-blind randomized controlled trial, in which youth aged 14–25 years with early mental health problems were randomly allocated to experimental (EMIcompass+treatment as usual [TAU]) or control condition (TAU). Data was collected before randomization, at post-intervention and at four-week follow-up. \nResults: N = 92 participants were recruited, of which n = 46 were allocated to the experimental condition. No signals of indirect effects of condition on any outcome through the five mechanisms (i.e., 95 % confidence intervals included zero) were found. The magnitude of association, however, indicated that the association between EMIcompass and psychological distress may be mediated via pathways through threat anticipation (β = -0.12, 95%CI = -0.30 – 0.03). Further, we observed associations between changes in candidate mechanisms and mental health outcomes.\nConclusions: Although no direct signals of mediation via candidate mechanisms were observed due to lack of power, condition-linked shifts in our candidate mechanisms were associated with mental-health outcomes. Larger mechanism-powered trials are now required to delineate causal pathways and refine scalable prevention and early intervention strategies.",

Behavioral reinforcement learning---an influential approach to understanding how people learn from interactions with the environment---is one such field. What characterizes this research landscape, and how is it interconnected? Here, we introduce a novel bibliometric approach---combining computational semantics, large language models, and clustering methods---to explore article clusters within behavioral reinforcement learning. Our analysis provides a comprehensive map of the field, highlighting broad lines of behavioral and neuroscientific research and documenting a wide array of interdisciplinary topics. We characterize research clusters by frequent research topics and methods, key journals, and publication timeline. Moreover, we examine the relationships between clusters and visualize the distribution of research topics and methods across the landscape. Finally, we discuss implications for facilitating scientific exchange and present an online tool for exploring the landscape.",

          "authors": "Sebastian Ehmann; Terje Sparby; Daniel M. Ingram; Matthew Sacchet",
          "abstract": "That meditation is similar to mental training is a widely used analogy that seeks to capture the\ngrowth-oriented processes that unfold through the intentional performance of mental activities.\nHowever, despite its intuitive appeal, this notion remains conceptually underdeveloped. To our\nknowledge, no interdisciplinary dialogue has been established with training science—a field\ndedicated to the understanding of training variables and principles. In this paper, we address this\ngap by first providing an overview of foundational principles in exercise science, introducing key\nconcepts such as programming and periodization. Building on this foundation, we outline how\ncore training variables—such as volume, frequency, duration, density, and intensity—can be\nmeaningfully adapted to contemplative training contexts. Among these, we propose training\nintensity, defined as the graded phenomenal presence of specific meditative qualities together with\nthe minimization of counteractive qualities. Referenced against a normative standard, this\nconstruct offers a particularly promising link between objective training metrics of meditative\nexperience and subjective markers of meditative proficiency. We argue that advanced meditation\nentails not only the accumulation of training volume over time but the refinement and mastery of\nspecific skills that enable access to advanced meditative states, stages, and endpoints. Finally, we\nsuggest that meditation would benefit from adopting a unified semantic framework and\nsystematically assessing these training variables, thereby enabling more precise, comparable, and\ncumulative analyses across studies. This work represents a first step toward integrating principles\nfrom training science into meditation research, offering novel tools to understand the mechanisms\nand trajectories underlying meditative development.",

It also tests the effects of party cues on the intentions assigned to reformers proposing to alter democratic rules. The results show that (1) the in-party supporters evaluated the intentions to reform checks and balances as benign, whereas the out-party supporters were more vigilant and saw them as malicious; (2) participants were less vigilant of an administrative reform and evaluated it as less ill-intended; (3) these effects held across supporters of different political parties – both incumbent and opposition.

Scoping review objectives included: (1) identifying and characterizing existing mHealth interventions targeting emotional awareness and regulation during the transition to parenthood, (2) examining integration of pregnancy-specific contexts and challenges, and (3) synthesizing evidence regarding effectiveness, user engagement, and implementation outcomes. We conducted a comprehensive search (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Google Scholar) to identify peer-reviewed empirical articles focused on preventive mHealth interventions supporting emotional awareness and regulation during the perinatal period. Two independent reviewers screened and extracted data from each article using Covidence. Altogether, 41 manuscripts were included representing 38 unique mHealth interventions. Altogether, findings indicate a major gap in provision of personalized mHealth support for emotional awareness and regulation during the transition to parenthood, with several implications for future intervention development.",

          "abstract": "Reward and punishment learning are critical across multiple clinical populations. The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is frequently used to assess these constructs and multiple forms of psychopathology are associated with IGT performance. However, it is not clear whether alterations in IGT performance are general to psychopathology, or specific to different forms of psychopathology. Thus, we examined whether IGT performance was uniquely predicted by anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder. We tested a sample of adults (N=293) on the play-or-pass version of the IGT. We characterized behavior using a hierarchical Bayesian computational model, formalizing parameters underlying task behavior. With the model, we examined unique associations between IGT performance and lifetime diagnostic history of anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder. Anxiety, but not depression or substance use, was associated with higher punishment learning rates, posterior mean β = 0.15, 95% CI [0.01,0.28]. In addition, women showed lower punishment learning rates, posterior mean β = -0.17, 95% CI [-0.30,-0.03], and lower response bias, posterior mean β = -0.30, 95% CI [-0.56,-0.05]. The relation between punishment learning rates and history of anxiety was small; however, our findings were consistent with established findings in anxiety derived from self-report. In addition, only main effects of diagnostic status were examined; thus, future research should examine comorbidity between diagnoses on IGT performance. Overall, our findings are consistent with research showing that anxiety is associated with punishment avoidance. In addition, our behavioral findings with respect to gender are also consistent with previous research employing the IGT.",

          "abstract": "Remembering personal events typically involves reconstructing our original first-person perspective, often accompanied by a vivid sense of re-experiencing the past. The angular gyrus (AnG) has been implicated in both perspective reconstruction and subjective memory experience, yet its specific contribution remains unclear. We investigated the role of the AnG across three studies using a behavioural paradigm in which healthy adults (aged 18–35) encoded a naturalistic video. At retrieval, participants judged whether test images matched their original perspective and rated subjective aspects of the experience, including vividness and re-experiencing. In Study 1 (n=42), vividness ratings significantly predicted accurate perspective discrimination. In Study 2 (n=45), offline repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the AnG significantly enhanced perspective discrimination relative to control stimulation, with richness of visual imagery predicting performance. In Study 3 (n=28), online rTMS to the AnG produced a non-significant impairment in discrimination, suggesting possible disruption. Re-experiencing ratings predicted successful discrimination of first-person perspective scenes, particularly under AnG stimulation. Across these studies, we show that the AnG supports memory for encoded perspective and contributes to subjective aspects of episodic retrieval. The direction of its influence may depend on stimulation timing and its interaction with broader cortical networks involved in self-referential processing and memory reconstruction.",

          "abstract": "Despite urgent need for sustainable solutions, many individuals resist sustainability innovations such as plant-based diets or genetically modified organisms. This sustainability behavior gap stems partly from misaligned risk perceptions: individuals rely on heuristics that generate cognitive biases, whereas experts use statistical probabilities. Existing interventions often fail to produce lasting effects because they neglect underlying cognitive drivers of risk perception. We introduce rebiasing, a novel strategy that leverages cognitive biases to realign risk perceptions. Across seven studies (N = 2,213), we show that (1) opposing heuristics and biases can neutralize each other, reverting perceptions to baseline; (2) rebiasing can be tailored to individuals with either high or low risk perceptions to better align with expert views; and (3) adjusted perceptions influence downstream sustainability behaviors, though context-dependently. Our findings advance theory on bias interaction and offer actionable insights for marketers, policymakers, and advocates seeking to close the sustainability behavior gap.",

          "abstract": "Online, at-home testing of scholastic skills can widen participation in research, but needs evidence on quality and practicality. We ran two pilots in samples of Dutch adults to: (a) compare a digital version to the official pen &amp; paper version on a short arithmetic test (TempoToets Rekenen; TTR), (b) evaluate two online vocabulary tests, (c) benchmark a developing abstract-reasoning test (OMSS), and (d) examine the Dutch translation of the Math Ability Rating Questionnaire (MARQ) self-report.\nPilot I (N = 55) included home online testing and supervised lab testing (online and pen/paper). Home: TTR, Matrix Reasoning Item Bank (MaRs-IB), synonym vocabulary test, Dutch Auditory &amp; Image Vocabulary Test (DAIVT).  Lab: TTR, synonym test, DAIVT, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-III) and the OMSS. Pilot II (N=61) repeated TTR across three settings; home-digital, lab-digital, lab-pen/paper and compared it to (subsets of) the MARQ. Outcomes included internal consistency (α), Pearson correlations (r), intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) from mixed models, administration time, and feasibility indicators.\nArithmetic (TTR): In Pilot I, cross-format associations were moderate (r = .63). In Pilot II, home-digital vs pen/paper r = .69, lab-digital vs pen/paper r = .70, and home- vs lab-digital r = .79. Scores were generally higher on pen/paper than on the digital versions (modality effect), but the two digital settings were more consistent.\nVocabulary: Both tests were reliable and convergent with PPVT: DAIVT α = .90; r = .76; synonym α = .85; r = .66. The synonym test was shorter than the DAIVT (~4.5 vs. 7 min) and required no audio, favouring remote feasibility; DAIVT provided stronger convergence, likely reflecting the similar format to the PPVT.\nAbstract reasoning: OMSS showed acceptable preliminary indices versus MaRs-IB (α = .67; r = .56; ICC = .51; ~11 min). A ~20-item OMSS form appears efficient with limited expected loss in precision.\nSelf-reported math (MARQ): Internal consistency was strong (α &gt; .80 for MARQ-19/5/3). Higher MARQ scores (poorer self-reported arithmetic ability) were weakly to, at best, moderately correlated with TTR (timed arithmetic performance); the strongest being for MARQ-5 (r = −.33, p = .011).\nFor the remote, online version of the TTR standardized administration (clear on-screen instructions, short practice, consistent device) is crucial to limit modality-related variance. For vocabulary, both online tests are suitable; the synonym test is pragmatic for remote use, whereas DAIVT offers stronger convergence at greater time cost. OMSS is promising pending item refinement and shortening. MARQ–TTR associations were weaker than expected, suggesting differences in construct coverage (broad self-report vs. timed operations), translation and sample effects. Within MARQ, the MARQ5 subset appears most suitable in our context due to its brevity, high internal consistency, and the strongest, albeit modest, correlation with TTR.",

We examined this claim by comparing the acceptability of clitic doubling in three different speaker groups: monolingual and heritage speakers of European Spanish, and Rioplatense Spanish monolinguals. Accusative clitic doubling is grammaticalized in Rioplatense but not in European Spanish, consistent with Rioplatense Spanish being a more diachronically innovative variety. If heritage speakers mirror diachronic change, they may perform more similarly to Rioplatense than European monolinguals. The results of an acceptability judgement task showed that heritage speakers had robust knowledge of clitics but did not show evidence of progressive behavior with accusative clitic doubling. We propose that grammatical innovation may crucially depend on the demographic characteristics of heritage speakers, and on the grammatical properties of the phenomenon tested.",

          "abstract": "Social scientists often compare groups in terms of relations between latent variables (LV) (often called structural relations) using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). LVs are measured indirectly by questionnaires; thus, measurement invariance must be evaluated before comparisons can be made. To efficiently compare many groups, the recently proposed Mixture Multigroup SEM (MMG-SEM) clusters groups based on their structural relations while accounting for measurement (non-)invariance. However, the current MMG-SEM relies on maximum likelihood (ML) estimation, which assumes continuous indicators. This can introduce bias when dealing with ordinal data, especially for variables with fewer item categories. In this paper, we extend MMG-SEM to accommodate ordinal data relying on the stepwise Structural-After-Measurement estimation approach. In the first step, we implement a multigroup categorical confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CCFA) with diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) to estimate the measurement model (MM). The second step uses ML to perform the clustering and estimate cluster-specific structural relations. A simulation study compares the performance of this approach to that of ML-based MMG-SEM under various conditions. The results show a better recovery of MM parameters with DWLS, particularly with fewer response categories, whereas both approaches perform similarly regarding the recovery of the clusters and structural relations.",

          "abstract": "Movement control faces a problem of redundancy. In general, there are more degrees of freedom available to solve a task than the task requires. This ‘degrees of freedom’ problem has been reframed as a ‘motor abundance’ feature (Latash, 2012), where the redundancy enables crucial flexibility. The balance between flexibility and control has been proposed to depend on synergies, which are lower-dimensional organisations of movement dynamics into systems that solve the task at hand. There are now several movement analysis methods designed to search for the signatures of synergies (the uncontrolled manifold, Scholz &amp; Schöner, 1999; tolerance-noise-covariation, Cohen &amp; Sternad, 2009, and others) and a great deal of empirical evidence that synergies feature in movement control. However, while all of these analysis methods rely on notions of ‘task’ to constrain movement solutions, they do not come with a formal theory of what a task is or how tasks are perceived. This paper proposes the hypothesis that tasks should be formalised as task-dynamical affordances, and that perceiving these via specifying information is how they constrain synergy formation (effectivities). I lay out the hypothesis, and detail a research programme to investigate the hypothesis, with reference to existing work on throwing.",

Individuals perceive products as higher in quality when ratings are presented on a binary scale, assuming reviews have been assigned to positive or negative categories based on whether they are above or below the midpoint of a five-point scale. Individuals perceive products as being of equivalent quality across scales only when ratings of four and five are taken as positive, and the remainder as negative. However, when individuals are asked to generate a five-point ratings distribution from binary ratings, they do not account for this skewed perception of positivity unless the five-point scale is labelled so that the ‘neutral’ point of the scale is defined as four rather than three. These findings have theoretical implications for understanding how people implicitly categorise and bin ratings, as well as practical implications for industry and policymakers.",

          "abstract": "The behavioral immune system, a set of antipathogenic psychological adaptations driven by disgust, has been shown to shape social dynamics and influence outgroup prejudice. Traditional models of xenophobia have historically emphasized the role of fear, stress, and anxiety, potentially overlooking the role of disgust. To better capture the specificity of disgust-driven outgroup prejudice, we introduce the term xenodyskheria (from the old Greek xenos-(ξένος) = stranger and-dyskheria (δυσχέρεια) = disgust or repugnance). We explore the extent of xenodyskheria's influence on outgroup prejudice before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic-arguably one of the most salient pathogen threats of the century. We found that, prior to the pandemic, pathogen disgust had no effect on rejection of and callousness towards healthy looking strangers. However, at the onset of the pandemic, pathogen disgust became the main predictor of outgroup prejudice. In contrast, neither stress nor anxiety were associated with outgroup prejudice during or after the pandemic. Interestingly, we observed a paradoxical relationship between pathogen and moral disgust, as the latter can serve as a \"buffer\" tempering the exclusionary tendencies of the former, despite these two disgust domains being highly correlated. Additionally, our Post-COVID sample showed no reversion to pre-pandemic levels of xenodyskheria, suggesting that the psychological effects of COVID-19 crisis may have left a more enduring imprint on social dynamics than previously assumed. Results are discussed in the light of evolutionary theories. Future research avenues for a dual-process model of behavioral immunity and for pre-genocide dehumanization processes are proposed.",

Here, we studied how these two aspects of learning should be sequenced to promote effective task acquisition. We designed video games in which different concepts (tools or ingredients) were used sequentially to complete the task (reach a goal or create a potion). During self-directed learning, participants chose to progress via a curriculum that graduated the complexity of concept discovery (number of concepts involved) rather than of concept implementation (number of steps to goal). However, those who chose to graduate the implementation complexity performed better. Three subsequent experiments that randomised participants into curriculum groups confirmed that adjusting the complexity of concept implementation (not discovery) is the more effective learning strategy. When acquiring complex tasks, learners should not attempt to discover new concepts prematurely, but instead focus on practicing those which they have already mastered.",

          "authors": "Immanuel Stoltenhoff; Ineke van der Ham; Anne Cuperus; Judith Schomaker",
          "abstract": "Treadmill Virtual Reality (VR) has a potential application in rehabilitation, but its adoption is hampered by commonly experienced cybersickness symptoms, and an incomplete understanding of the factors that influence relevant (learning) outcomes. Previous studies have suggested that with active locomotion (self-motion) cybersickness symptoms may be limited. Restriction of the field-of-view – e.g., via the use of video vignettes – may also reduce symptoms. Whether a VR intervention is effective may also depend on the subjective presence within the virtual environment as experienced by the user. It remains unclear, however, what the optimal conditions to prevent cybersickness and to induce high levels of presence are. In the current study we investigated the effect of self-motion (walking vs. standing) and field of view as manipulated by vignetting (on vs. off) on cybersickness, presence and memory. Thirty-two healthy adults walked two predetermined routes in two different virtual environments: During one trial participants walked on the treadmill, determining direction with a handlebar (walking condition; using a Virtuwalk-treadmill), and during the other trial (order counterbalanced between participants), participants used the handlebar while standing still to move around the virtual environment (standing condition). In a between-subjects design, half the participants experienced the virtual environments with a vignette that restricted the field-of-view, while vignetting was not applied for the other half of the participants. In contrast to expectations, cybersickness was not influenced by walking or vignetting. However, results showed a positive effect of self-motion on presence, with higher presence in the walking than no-walking condition. In addition, presence and motivation were positively correlated. Vignetting did not affect presence, but it reduced landmark memory, potentially by partially obstructing the field-of-view. The current study’s findings thus suggest that self-motion is positively associated with presence, and in turn higher presence is associated with higher motivation. Vignetting did not reduce cybersickness and may not be recommended when memory of the environment is of relevance.",

Self-report data were collected from 211 adult women (88% response rate) in Belgian prisons, representing 42% of all female prisoners nationwide. During their current incarceration, one in three (31%) participants had ever used drugs and a quarter (26%) did so in the past month. Cannabis and non-prescribed tranquillizers (such as benzodiazepines) were most commonly used. The main reasons cited by participants for using drugs in prison were to relieve stress, forget problems, and counteract boredom. In a multivariate analysis, perceived social support and availability of meaningful activities were negatively associated with recent drug use while incarcerated. Other factors related to the prison environment had no significant influence on drug use, providing a more nuanced perspective on extant qualitative literature.",

          "abstract": "Understanding others’ mental states is a cornerstone of human cognition, yet how spontaneous\nbelief attribution operates in complex, naturalistic perception remains underexplored. Dramatic\nirony (DI)—a narrative device through which viewers are made aware of crucial information\nwhich is unknown to characters of the narrative—provides a controlled but naturalistic context\nto examine these processes. Using a curated DI film corpus (Cabañas et al., 2023), we\ncombined eye-tracking with a Self-Paced Viewing (SPV) paradigm to investigate how SToM\nshapes real-time processing. In a pre-registered between-subjects study (https://osf.io/by56s),\nparticipants viewed edited Harold Lloyd film excerpts that either provided viewers with\nprivileged information unknown to a character (Installation group) or withheld it to align\nviewer and character knowledge (Control group), reflecting false-belief and true-belief\nscenarios, respectively. We analysed narrative comprehension, reaction times, and eye-\ntracking measures indexing cognitive effort and attentional allocation. Results showed that the\nInstallation group exhibited longer viewing times at moments of representational conflict and\nlonger overall fixation durations, indicating greater cognitive effort. Gaze analyses revealed\nselective attention to belief-relevant characters and objects, suggesting top-down control\nguided by mental state representations. Extended dwell times on characters’ mouths in the\nInstallation group further reflected deliberate information seeking. These findings indicate that\nviewers spontaneously construct and maintain complex false-belief representations during DI\ncomprehension, dynamically modulating cognitive processing and attention. By integrating\nnaturalistic film stimuli with controlled manipulations, this study extends theories of scene\ncomprehension to include spontaneous mentalizing, offering a tractable model of social\nreasoning in dynamic visual contexts.",

          "abstract": "Polyregulation refers to employing multiple strategies to regulate emotions within a single emotional episode. However, evidence on its affective outcomes remains inconclusive, likely due to reliance on strategy count as the operationalization of polyregulation and the overlook of context sensitivity. Across two independent ecological momentary assessment (EMA) studies from the United States (Study 1, N = 158, 12,217 observations) and China (Study 2, N = 144, 11,347 observations), we introduced the effective strategy ratio, the ratio of idiographically effective strategies to total strategies used, to evaluate the overall quality of polyregulation. We directly tested whether the joint contribution of context sensitivity and the overall quality predicted various indices of momentary psychological distress. Total number of strategies was associated with increased distress at lower levels of the effective strategy ratio, but with reduced distress at higher levels. Context sensitivity magnified the benefits of high effective strategy ratio but was less helpful when the ratio was low. The results were robust across culturally distinct samples and after controlling for lagged distress. These findings underscore the utility of the effective strategy ratio and highlight the synergistic benefits of flexibly aligning idiographic effective strategies with contextual demands. We emphasize the importance of moving beyond strategy count to focus on overall quality and prioritizing context-sensitive emotion regulation in future affective science research.",

          "abstract": "Subclinical ADHD is common in adults, marked by meaningful impairments, yet treatment options for this group remain limited. Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) offers a scalable neuromodulatory approach, but its behavioral effects in subclinical ADHD are poorly understood. This study tested whether online (during-stimulation) taVNS yields domain-general or domain-specific cognitive benefits. Twenty adults with elevated inattention completed two single-blind, sham-controlled, and counterbalanced sessions. Stimulation was delivered at 25 Hz to the cymba concha (active) or at 1 Hz with identical montage and sensation (sham). Participants performed the Attention Network Task (ANT: alerting, orienting, executive control) and a 2-back working memory task. ANT reaction times were analyzed with generalized linear mixed models; 2-back accuracy with linear mixed models. Blinding was successful, and only mild transient side effects occurred. Results showed that active taVNS selectively reduced flanker interference, indicating enhanced attentional control, with no effects on alerting, orienting, or working memory. These findings demonstrate a domain-specific benefit of online taVNS in subclinical ADHD, selectively strengthening executive control rather than producing broad gains across attention and memory.",

While LQH components are typically investigated in reading, their role in resolving cognitive conflict remains unknown. This study applies the construct of lexical precision to the traditional naming Stroop task, a gold-standard to quantify cognitive conflict resolution specifically investigating its influence in dyslexia and stuttering. \nMethod: Stroop interference was measured in 84 neurotypical readers, 50 dyslexic adults and 30 adults who stutter (AWS). All participants completed a naming Stroop task, together with a suite of individual difference measures that were analysed using a Principal Component Analysis, which established measures of phonological precision and lexical precision. \nResults: The data showed that, on average, dyslexic adults and AWS showed significantly larger Stroop interference effects compared with neurotypical adults. Crucially, the magnitude of the Stroop interference was moderated by lexical precision. Dyslexic adults and AWS who scored higher on the lexical precision component showed Stroop interference levels similar to the neurotypical adults, while those with lower precision demonstrated a significantly larger Stroop interference. However, the level of Stroop interference did not differ between AWS and dyslexic adults. \nConclusions: The results indicate that an imprecise lexical representation underpins the difficulties in cognitive control mechanisms that are independent of the specific neurodivergent groups.",

          "abstract": "Mixed emotions are strongly linked to aesthetic emotions, which involve both positive and negative emotional experiences. Mixed emotions are aroused as complex emotional reactions to artworks. However, the mixed emotional experiences aroused by paintings have received scant attention in empirical science. This study seeks to quantify the intensity of mixed emotional experiences aroused by paintings and explore their relationships with the emotional and categorical characteristics of the paintings as well as with aesthetic emotion. In online surveys, 948 participants rated 356 paintings across seven emotional scales: three for basic positive emotions (amusement, happiness, and pleasure), three for basic negative emotions (sadness, fear, and disgust), and one for aesthetics (beauty). The strong co-occurrences of aesthetic and basic negative emotions, such as “sad beauty,” were demonstrated using data-driven principal component analysis (PCA) and theory-driven quantifications with minimum index (MI). The couplings of basic positive and negative emotions were also quantified using MI and their intensities were associated with the aesthetic emotion, albeit those couplings were relatively weak and not evident in the PCA. Furthermore, both qualitative and quantitative assessments of the paintings revealed that mixed emotional characteristics were distinctive between their negative emotional constituents. The contributions of mixed and negative emotions to aesthetic experiences have been discussed in philosophical aesthetics and art studies. This study provides empirical evidence and sheds new light on these philosophical questions.",

          "abstract": "Community violence is an epidemic in the United States. Studies estimate almost 30% of youth experience community violence, with higher rates in low-income, urban settings. Community violence exposure is consistently linked to adverse mental health outcomes, including post-traumatic stress, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms. In response, nationwide efforts have emphasized increased financial investment in social services as a potential means to mitigate the impact of violence exposure. Yet, gaps remain in understanding whether structural investments (i.e., social service expenditures) moderate mental health outcomes. This study aimed to: (1) provide an updated examination of the associations between community violence exposure and mental health outcomes, and (2) test whether state-level social service expenditures moderated these associations. We conducted a spatial meta-analysis using a three-level random-effects model, linking study data to publicly available Census expenditures data. A total of 155 studies representing 23 states yielded 769 effect sizes. Results indicated a significant small-to-moderate positive association between community violence and mental health (Fisher’s z = 0.22, p &lt; .0001; 95% CI [0.20, 0.24]), with heterogeneity across studies (Q = 9524.4, df = 768, p &lt; .0001). Hospital and veterans’ services spending weakened the positive associations with somatic and post-traumatic stress outcomes. By contrast, employment security and health spending amplified the positive associations with internalizing outcomes. Findings underscore the enduring mental health burden of community violence, the potential role of targeted policy investments, and the need for cross-disciplinary research to clarify how psychological and structural factors impact mental health outcomes among those exposed to community violence.",

Building on an unexpected finding of stronger White–rich/Black–poor stereotyping among third-group individuals (e.g., Latine and Asian Americans) relative to Black and White Americans, we hypothesized that biased social sampling from network homophily might produce this stereotype. Supporting this possibility, we observed that (a) contact with Black people explained racial group differences in stereotyping and, crucially, (b) exposing participants to counterstereotypic (Black–rich and White–poor) exemplars decreased the degree of stereotyping across a number of procedural variations and to similar degrees across racial groups. Overall, these findings suggest that social relationships are critical to understanding how individuals form and maintain stereotypes about groups that are unequal in wealth and status.",

Indeed, an experience is represented as a point in \"experiential space\" and is given by the output of a \"binding function\" applied to the solution to a neural network coding equation, introduced in \"Predicate Coding\" (Bonal, 2025),  for the sensory nervous system at a given time. This work aims to address the \"Neural Binding Problem\", understood here as explaining the unity of conscious experience yielded through the activity of a distributed system, such as the sensory nervous system. Finally, this model yields testable hypotheses, such as: (i) TMS-induced perturbations to regions responsible for processing a subset of perceivable predicates should selectively distort corresponding dimensions in  experiential space ; (ii) The implementation of a Brain-Computer Interface directly interacting with the sensory nervous system, would yield phenomenal representations coming from the interface within the experience's coordinates ; (iii) The presentation of a gradually changing sequence of stimuli with diverse predicate values during a fixed time interval should yield a higher path-average speed within the experiential space, than the presentation of unchanging stimuli during the same fixed time interval  ; (iv)  The presentation of unchanging stimuli followed by a rapid change in stimuli with diverse predicate values during a fixed time interval should yield a higher distance speed within the experiential space, than the presentation of unchanging stimuli during the same fixed time interval.",

This cross-sectional study investigated age-related differences in SEB skills and their gender variations using a large sample (N=31,315, ages 10-70). There were four key findings. First, there were temporary and modest decreases in some skill domains during early adolescence, possibly reflecting “adolescent disruption.” Second, despite these temporary declines, mean levels of all SEB skill domains increased with age, with most skill domains (Self-Management, Social Engagement, Cooperation, and Emotional Resilience) improving markedly during adolescence and early adulthood. This is broadly consistent with “maturation” in the personality trait literature. Third, there was considerable heterogeneity in age-related patterns when assessing specific skill facets. Fourth, there were some gender differences: men and women varied in age-related differences for Cooperation and Innovation skills, and non-binary youth reported lower initial levels on most skills but showed greater positive change during adolescence and early adulthood. These patterns show both parallels and distinctions with developmental principles derived from the personality trait literature, such as adolescent disruption and adult maturation. These findings provide the most comprehensive map of SEB skill development to date and should be used to inform future longitudinal studies and the design of developmentally-timed interventions.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a perspective grounded in critical psychiatry and decolonial epistemologies, synthesising interdisciplinary scholarship and lived experience testimony to interrogate the diagnostic construct of borderline personality disorder (BPD) as a site of iatrogenic harm and epistemic violence. Clinical discourse commonly positions long-term therapeutic engagement as a risk factor for “dependence,” framing care recipients as the locus of complication. Rather than accepting this premise, we locate harm within systemic, relational and epistemic practices embedded in psychiatric culture. We argue that conditionality, pathologising interpretations of support needs and punitive framings of self-advocacy produce iatrogenic harm, whereas consistent and validating therapeutic relationships foster safety and autonomy. Using a decolonial theoretical lens, this work critiques the misogynistic origins of the “dependence myth” and traces how Western attachment theory has been universalised to pathologise kinship forms outside nuclear family models, particularly in Indigenous, Black, migrant and collectivist communities. We further highlight how sensory processing differences are neglected in BPD discourse despite their significant role in self-injury, suicidality and embodied distress, calling for an expanded framework beyond relational psychodynamic explanations. Diagnostic bias toward sexually and gender diverse people is examined as a continuation of psychiatry’s historic regulation of gender and sexuality through personality pathology paradigms. Ultimately, we contend that the BPD construct functions less as a neutral clinical category and more as a colonial, cisheteronormative, and neuronormative governance technology that produces pathology through stigma, epistemic control, and carceral logics. Reframing BPD as a diagnostic instrument of social regulation rather than a disorder located within individuals opens space for care grounded in relational justice, cultural flexibility, sensory attunement, human rights, and epistemic humility, rather than the castigating of Western social nonconformity and the enforcement of compliance with normative behavioural conditioning.",

The current study explored how sexual fluidity beliefs, relationship satisfaction, and LGBTQ+ community connectedness were associated with sexual satisfaction among partners of TGNB individuals (n = 175; 72% cisgender women) via an online survey. Results showed that a minority of participants (27%) shifted their sexual identity label in response to having a TGNB partner; when shifts did occur, they were most often to broader labels. Relationship satisfaction was the strongest predictor of sexual satisfaction, and individuals who reported higher LGBTQ+ community connectedness reported higher relationship/sexual satisfaction relative to before their partner’s TGNB identity disclosure. Relationship satisfaction fully mediated the effect of LGBTQ+ community connectedness on sexual satisfaction. However, sexual fluidity beliefs were not associated with sexual satisfaction. The findings point to the ways in which relationships including a TGNB partner show similar patterns to those identified in other types of relationships, as well as highlight the importance of LGBTQ+ community connectedness for well-being in partners of TGNB individuals.",

We found that after controlling for the actual temporal distance, causally-related events were remembered as closer in time than unrelated events. This effect grew stronger after a consolidation period, with causally-connected memories showing greater temporal integration than memories that shared contextual overlap. Notably, within these causally-related events, temporal memory was superior for events where game clues were found. Further, participants who made greater in-game contributions to puzzle-solving showed better temporal memory and increased temporal integration between the contextually-related events compared to participants who contributed less. Together, these findings highlight the role of causal connections in driving memory integration and that agentic task engagement modulates how real-world experiences are remembered.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive reappraisal is an emotion regulation strategy that involves changing one’s interpretation of a situation to change its emotional impact. Cognitive reappraisal studies typically assess changes in valence ratings following reappraisal as the primary dependent variable, but scholars have recently documented that valence ratings can take two forms: affective valence (i.e., the positivity/negativity of one’s hedonic internal feelings) and semantic valence (i.e., the positivity/negativity of one’s cognitive evaluation of the stimulus). Because typical rating instructions do not distinguish between these forms of valence, it remains unknown how strongly cognitive reappraisal shifts either one. We address this gap through two preregistered studies. In Study 1, N=155 participants completed a classic cognitive reappraisal task in which they either responded naturally to or cognitively reappraised negative images. Critically, we manipulated whether participants rated either affective valence, semantic valence, or “default” valence (conventional instructions). Reappraisal significantly improved valence ratings in all conditions, but reappraisal most strongly influenced semantic valence and least strongly affective valence. Interestingly, default valence behaved most similarly to semantic valence, suggesting that existing reappraisal studies largely document changes in semantic evaluations, more than affective experiences. Study 2 (N=105) replicated these effects within-subjects. These results extend research on affective and semantic valence by demonstrating that they vary in their responsiveness to regulation. Additionally, they suggest that existing research likely overestimates the impact of reappraisal on felt emotional experiences, prompting new perspectives on past findings and more focused methods for assessing the hedonic impact of emotion regulation.",

          "abstract": "Cleeremans and Tallon-Baudry (2022) proposed that the core function of consciousness might be to enable agents to value their experiences. From this perspective, every conscious experience is affectively valenced, albeit to varying degrees. Interestingly, acting itself is associated with a specific phenomenology referred to as “sense of agency” (SoA, Pacherie 2008). Thus, if every conscious experience is valenced, and if performing an action is accompanied by a conscious SoA, then SoA should itself be valenced. Sixty participants completed an Affective Misattribution Procedure (Payne &amp; Lundberg, 2014) in which we manipulated two factors: intentionality (voluntary vs. passive key selection) and causality (outcome matching vs. not matching the selection). We expected the SoA to be higher in the voluntary/matching blocks than in the passive/non-matching blocks. Following the SoA manipulation, participants’ task was to judge the valence of a priori neutral Chinese pictographs. We hypothesized that higher SoA should be more positively valenced, and therefore implictly influencing the rating of the pictographs toward positive valences. While explicit reports could corroborate our hypothesis, we did not observe evidence of an influence of the SoA manipulation on the valuation of pictographs (i.e., implicit measure). However, exploratory analyses highlighted a high variability of the effect suggesting that SoA could be differently valenced from one individual to another rather than not valenced at all. Future studies should explore what produces this difference in the experience of SoA.",

          "abstract": "The e-QPASS (Quick Psychoaffective Symptoms Scan) is a comprehensive 105-item psychopathology assessment that captures three core emotional dimensions underlying mental illness: depression, anxiety, and anger. While clinically valuable, its 10-minute administration time creates barriers for high-throughput clinical and research settings. This study developed a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) version to preserve comprehensive symptom coverage while dramatically reducing respondent burden. We analyzed data from 625 participants (47.8% female, ages 15-79) who completed the full e-QPASS. Exploratory factor analysis identified dimensionality, and Item Response Theory (IRT) Graded Response Models were fitted to calibrate item parameters. CAT simulations determined optimal item administration sequences, with final versions limited to 12 items for general psychopathology and 8 items each for internalizing and externalizing dimensions. Concurrent validity was assessed by examining preservation of known gender differences in externalizing symptoms between full and CAT versions. Factor analysis revealed a robust two-factor structure: Dysregulated Externalizing and Internalizing. IRT models demonstrated acceptable fit (CFI=0.965, RMSEA=0.059). The CAT versions maintained high measurement precision (SE≤0.40) across clinically relevant trait levels while achieving a 10-fold reduction in items. Gender differences in externalizing symptoms were preserved with identical effect sizes across both full and CAT versions, confirming construct validity. The CAT e-QPASS successfully balances comprehensive psychopathology assessment with practical efficiency, offering substantial promise for clinical screening, treatment monitoring, and large-scale research applications where repeated assessments are essential.",

Here, we present ten simple rules for designing and operating a mobile research laboratory – a hybrid between scientific fieldwork and outreach – that enables data collection, education, and dialogue beyond conventional lab settings. Drawing on our experience developing and touring a neuroscience roadshow on circadian rhythms and light, we outline practical guidance on defining audiences, building interdisciplinary teams, managing logistics, and ensuring ethical and data protection standards. We also reflect on co-creation with the public, the challenges of working outside controlled environments, and strategies for sustainability and evaluation. Together, these lessons offer a roadmap for researchers seeking to combine high-quality science with meaningful, inclusive engagement in public spaces.",

The challenge of AI alignment is thus an interdisciplinary one that involves not only a technical challenge for computer science but one with important ties to the psychology of moral values, decision-making, and trust. Early work identified a static set of universal values, without considering the key questions of to whom and to which values AI should be aligned. This perspective paper challenges the notion of universal alignment and instead argues for dynamic, context-specific alignability across different domains, tasks, and users. Specifically, we emphasize the need to go beyond traditional pluralism and rethink how AI alignment can be achieved through a qualitative and quantitative research process that involves identifying context-specific values, developing alignable AI algorithms using limited human feedback, and evaluating alignment through assessing both an AI’s values and actions, while considering how humans trust and delegate to the AI. We discuss several paths forward for our proposed framework, including the potential ethical and societal implications of context-specific alignability, and draw on examples ranging from chatbots to value-aligned decision-making in the medical triage domain.",

          "abstract": "Whether selective attention alters initial sensory processing or instead only operates at higher cortical stages (often referred to as early vs. late selection) is a foundational question in cognitive neuroscience. Investigating the influence of covert visual selective attention, Clark and Hillyard (1996) found that directed attention modulated the amplitude of several early components (P1 and N1) of the visual event-related potential (ERP) derived from the ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG). However, attended and non-attended visual stimuli did not produce statistically different amplitudes in the C1 or P2 components. Dipole source estimation of the neural locus of these ERPs indicated that the C1 originated in primary (striate) visual cortex (V1), while the later components primarily arose from extrastriate visuocortical areas. Together, these results led to the conclusion that sustained spatial attention enhances the sensory gain of early visual processing in V1 via feedback projections from the extrastriate visual cortex where the P1 and N1 are generated. Despite the influential nature of this original work in EEG and cognitive neuroscience more broadly, recent research has reignited the debate on which stage of the visual processing hierarchy is influenced by attention. As part of the #EEGManyLabs project (Pavlov et al., 2021), we will be revisiting this issue by conducting a multi-site, high-powered direct replication of Clark and Hillyard (1996).",

Developing a digital adaptation of BAM has the potential to increase its accessibility and fill a critical gap in existing digital ED interventions, which to date have not specifically targeted anti-fat bias or fatphobia. This study applies a human-centered design approach to inform the development of a digital version of BAM.\n\nMethods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 31 participants, including 17 college students with elevated ED psychopathology and 14 past BAM participants. College students with elevated ED psychopathology shared experiences with fatphobia and anti-fat bias, how they use mental health technology, and thoughts on digitizing BAM. Past BAM participants shared experiences with BAM, how they use mental health technology, and thoughts on digitizing BAM. Interviews were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis with a critical realist lens.\n\nResults: College students with elevated ED psychopathology described pervasive and harmful experiences of anti-fat bias and fatphobia, coupled with difficulties accessing action-oriented mental health support, underscoring a gap in care that a digital adaptation of BAM could address. Both groups expressed strong interest in a hybrid digital format that combines synchronous and asynchronous components for a balance of social connection and flexibility. \n\nDiscussion: Findings suggest that a digital adaptation of BAM could address unmet needs in ED prevention by providing accessible, action-oriented content focused on anti-fat bias and fatphobia. Incorporating synchronous social connection within a flexible, interactive framework may promote engagement and impact. A critical next step will involve designing and pilot testing this digital adaptation of BAM to evaluate its feasibility and effectiveness.",

          "abstract": "Accurately quantifying belief strength in heuristics-and-biases tasks is crucial yet methodologically challenging. In this paper, we introduce an automated method leveraging large language models (LLMs) to systematically measure and manipulate belief strength. We specifically tested this method in the widely used “lawyer-engineer” base-rate neglect task, in which stereotypical descriptions (e.g., someone enjoying mathematical puzzles) conflict with normative base-rate information (e.g., engineers represent a very small percentage of the sample). Using this approach, we created an open-access database containing over 100,000 unique items systematically varying in stereotype-driven belief strength. Validation studies demonstrate that our LLM-derived belief strength measure correlates strongly with human typicality ratings and robustly predicts human choices in a base-rate neglect task. Additionally, our method revealed substantial and previously unnoticed variability in stereotype-driven belief strength in popular base-rate items from existing research, underlining the need to control for this in future studies. We further highlight methodological improvements achievable by refining the LLM prompt, as well as ways to enhance cross-cultural validity. The database presented here serves as a powerful resource for researchers, facilitating rigorous, replicable, and theoretically precise experimental designs, as well as enabling advancements in cognitive and computational modeling of reasoning. To support its use, we provide the R package baserater, which allows researchers to access the database to apply or adapt the method to their own research.",

          "abstract": "Social connection is a fundamental animal need, and its maintenance primarily depends on the rewarding nature of positive social interactions. A central feature of several medical conditions, including neuropsychiatric disorders, is decreased interest in positive social interactions and a tendency toward social isolation, which can in turn worsen these conditions. \nNumerous studies using animal models have identified brain mechanisms underlying both unconditioned and conditioned (using conditioned place preference) social interactions, where the interaction is imposed by the experimenter. In contrast, much less is known about the brain mechanisms involved in volitional, rewarding social interactions that are initiated by the animals themselves. This is critical as social interactions between humans are often voluntary. Early studies showed that rats will perform a volitional operant response to gain access to social interaction with a peer. More recently, the operant social self-administration procedure has been used to investigate the brain mechanisms of rewarding social interaction in mice, rats, prairie voles, and hamsters.\nIn this review, we summarize behavioral and neurobiological studies that have used the operant social self-administration procedure. We then discuss how this model has been used to study the effect of volitional social interaction across neurodevelopmental disorders, addiction, stress, pain, and inflammation, including its role in drug self-administration and relapse in rats, the identification of heroin-addiction–vulnerable individuals, and to study how pain and social stress disrupt volitional social interaction.

Using Reflexive Thematic Analysis, four overarching themes were formulated: (1) Negative Prior Experiences with Mathematics, (2) Misconceptions of Course Content, (3) Statistical Fragility, and (4) Student-Tutor Interaction. The findings show how early difficulties with mathematics and misaligned expectations about psychology as a discipline undermine fragile confidence when encountering statistical concepts, often resulting in hypervigilance and self-doubt. Tutor communication, class size, and assumptions about baseline competence further shaped students’ experiences, intensifying anxiety. This research provides a nuanced investigation of how students conceptualise statistics in their psychology journey, and offers suggestions and recommendations for applied practice.",

Previous research suggests that individual (i.e., feminist identity) and situational factors (i.e., humor type and joke teller gender) play an important role in interpreting feminist humor as a tool to subvert sexism and in its subsequent impact. Two studies were conducted to analyze the influence of participants' feminist identification and the joke teller’s gender on the appreciation and interpretation of feminist humor (Study 1) and on the proclivity to engage in collective action (Study 2). In Study 1 (N = 307), we manipulated humor type (feminist vs. neutral) and gender of the joke teller (woman vs. man). We found that weaker feminist identifiers perceived more criticism of sexism when the feminist (vs. neutral) joke was told by a woman (vs. a man), but no significant differences emerged in appreciation responses (i.e., funniness and aversiveness). In Study 2 (N = 200), we extended these findings and found that weaker feminist identifiers reported greater proclivity to engage in collective action after exposure to feminist jokes told by a woman, not by a man. These findings contribute to the understanding of the ways through which feminist humor can raise awareness of sexism, enable the recruitment of activists, and promote mobilization for social change.",

          "abstract": "Repetitive threat-neutralization is a common behavior pattern across anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that contributes to functional impairment. However, laboratory studies of this behavioral phenomenon are scant. In the present study, we examined effects of anxiety-related disorders and anxiety sensitivity on repetitive threat-neutralization behavior. Adults recruited from the community (n=40) with and without anxiety-related disorders completed clinician-administered and self-reported anxiety assessments and the Tap-to-Safety Task. Task stimuli included a threat cue (CS+) paired with shock, safety cues (CS-) never paired with shock, and safe stimuli varying in similarity to the CS+. The task included choice trials, in which participants could repeatedly tap a button to reduce risk of shock, while also reducing accumulation of reward points. In an extinction phase, shocks were no longer administered. We conducted linear mixed-effects models to examine differences related to anxiety sensitivity and anxiety disorder diagnosis in repetitive threat-neutralization behavior across stimulus types. Participants with greater anxiety sensitivity showed more adaptive neutralization behavior to the true threat-cue as well as more unnecessary neutralization to the former threat-cue. Those with anxiety-related disorders showed more neutralization behavior to the former threat-cue. Anxiety sensitivity and anxiety-related disorder status were both associated with less-steep declines in neutralization behavior across trials of extinction, consistent with the hypothesis that neutralization behaviors would persist in safe situations for anxious individuals. These findings suggest that the TTS task captures anxiety-related individual differences in extinction of repetitive threat-neutralization behavior, and provides an adaptable tool for probing threat-related behaviors.",

We conducted a pre-registered systematic review and multilevel meta-analysis to quantify the burden of psychological distress in this population (PROSPERO: CRD42024596813). A total of 139 studies and four primary databases were identified (k = 212, N = 128,684) via Scopus and supplementary searches through 31 December 2024. Based on established diagnostic thresholds, pooled prevalence estimates indicated that 28.9% (95% confidence interval 25.3–32.7%) of ECRs met the criteria for at least one mental health syndrome or symptom. Specifically, 28.9% (25.4–32.5%) met criteria for depression, 29.1% (25.4–32.9%) for generalized anxiety disorder, 24.9% (20.6–29.4%) for an eating disorder, 21.4% (17.2–26.0%) for alcohol abuse, 18.2% (14.2–22.6%) engaged in nonsuicidal self-injury, and 17.5% (14.2–21.0%) reported suicidal ideation. Complementing prevalence estimates, analyses of normalized severity scores indicated that ECRs experienced mild degrees of depression, anxiety, and moderate degrees of stress. Severity estimates for eating disorders and suicidal ideation did not exceed clinical cut-offs. Moderator analyses indicated that the type of syndrome and the type of measurement scale explained the largest part of the variance in both the prevalence and the severity models. Most individual-level factors, such as gender, ethnicity, academic discipline, country, career stage, social support, and supervisor relationship, did not significantly moderate prevalence or severity estimates. Age showed a small, but significant association with lower prevalence (β = -0.01, CI -0.03 – -0.0009). Higher study quality and random or full sampling were also associated with lower severity and prevalence levels of psychological distress. These findings underscore both the need for structural reforms and for the implementation of evidence-based support services and interventions for ECRs.",

          "abstract": "Across species, cooperative decisions are often asymmetric: one individual risks their own resources before knowing whether others will reciprocate. Such uncertainty is central to the evolution of trust and reciprocal exchanges. Physiological synchrony is frequently assumed to support cooperation, yet it remains unclear both how synchrony arises and how it functions in these asymmetric social interactions. We tested whether mutual visibility shapes physiological synchrony, and whether synchrony in turn predicts cooperative behaviour in repeated trust-reciprocity exchanges. Skin conductance synchrony was stronger and more temporally aligned when individuals interacted face-to-face, yet facial expressivity did not account for this effect. Contrary to the dominant perspective, higher synchrony predicted reduced reciprocity, and only when partners could see each other. Exploratory analyses suggested that this negative link depended on arousal, indicating that the social function of synchrony is shaped by both mutual visibility and the affective state of the individual involved. These findings show that physiological synchrony is not a uniformly prosocial mechanism but a context-dependent phenomenon that can undermine cooperation under certain conditions, offering insight into the mechanisms and the function of synchrony in shaping cooperative exchanges.",

This influence has been theorized to differ by cultural tightness—the extent to which people adhere to shared cultural norms. Understanding whether and how cultural context moderates the influence of behavioral interventions is essential for the design of culturally-attuned and adaptable interventions to address collective action problems like climate change. Yet, past research has primarily relied on correlational approaches to test this theory, without experimentally manipulating norm information across different settings, limiting insights into how cultural context shapes conformity to norm information. Our study tests the effects of three social norm interventions on the climate-related attitudes and behaviors of 16,070 participants in 42 countries. We find limited evidence that cultural tightness moderates the strength of conformity to social norm information in our study, suggesting a more nuanced relationship between the two.",

In addition to characterizing typical development, CDIs have also been used to detect “red flags” for language delay (e.g., Guinchat et al., 2012; Herlihy et al., 2015). Furthermore, CDIs have since been applied in studies of children with neurodevelopmental conditions and genetic syndromes, often beyond the age range CDIs were designed for (e.g., Luyster et al., 2007). These studies span clinical screening, developmental monitoring, outcome prediction, and the exploration of condition-specific developmental profiles (e.g., Rescorla, 2011; Can et al., 2013; Tager-Flusberg et al., 2009).

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in scientific research for their strong general problem-solving capabilities. Data extraction remains one of the most time- and labor-consuming steps in evidence synthesis (ES), making LLMs a promising tool with improved efficiency and accuracy. Our study evaluates the performance of different LLMs and proposes a novel method, Divide, Conquer, then Recheck (DCR), to optimize for LLM-based data extraction in ES. Multiple LLM foundational models were compared through accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We find that GPT-4o demonstrates notably better performance across most variables compared to ChatPDF, Bing Chat, and GPT-4. The proposed DCR method powered by GPT4-o achieved higher accuracy in most structured data extraction and the few-shot prompting strategy further improved performance on complex information (e.g., correlation coefficient). These findings highlight the potential of using LLMs in ES research.",

          "authors": "Konstantinos Vassilis Petrides",
          "abstract": "This white paper presents the derivation and validation of the TEIQue-DISC®, a novel DISC assessment instrument derived from the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue). Widely used in workplaces for behavioral profiling despite well-documented psychometric limitations, the DISC model categorizes individuals along four dimensions: Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, and Conscientiousness. By extracting DISC profiles from the scientifically grounded TEIQue framework, the white paper introduces a robust alternative to existing DISC tools. Using multiple large datasets (N ranging from 101 to 13790), we implemented data-intensive methods, including machine learning techniques to identify items meeting stringent criteria for circumplex structure, internal consistency, and normative measurement. Multidimensional scaling analyses of three independent samples confirmed excellent fit to the theoretical DISC model, with the four traits arranged at approximately 90° intervals. Baseline internal consistency estimates were satisfactory across traits and datasets. Wide-ranging testing of 28 prespecified hypotheses examined relationships with gender, established personality measures (16PF, TEIQue, and NEO), occupational roles, managerial levels, and industry sectors. All hypotheses were supported, exhibiting theoretically expected convergent and discriminant validity patterns. The TEIQue-DISC® offers several advantages over legacy DISC instruments: empirically proven circular arrangement, protection against response manipulation through semantic concealment, dual assessment efficiency simultaneously providing both trait emotional intelligence and DISC profiles, and identification of up to 20 distinct behavioral styles through a mathematically exhaustive classification system. While constrained by inherent limitations of the DISC model, the TEIQue-DISC® constitutes an advancement in personality diagnostics, bridging sophisticated psychological theory with practical applicability.",

          "abstract": "Cochlear implants (CIs) provide deaf individuals with access to auditory feedback from their own voice during production. This experiment investigated whether typical hearing participants can use CI simulated speech feedback for perceptual learning and sensorimotor control of speech. CI simulation was achieved via noise vocoding, a technique that degrades the spectral detail in a speech signal in a manner similar to a CI. 32 participants took part in the experiment. First, participants were tested on their recognition of noise vocoded sentences before and after a training task; either perception training, where participants listened to noise vocoded sentences while reading matching text; or production training, where participants read aloud sentences whilst hearing their own voice noise-vocoded in real-time. Both groups of participants then underwent a speech motor adaptation paradigm in which formants were perturbed in real-time noise vocoded speech auditory feedback. Both perception and production training tasks resulted in significant improvements in recognition of noise vocoded sentences, with no effect of training type. Speech motor adaptation however was not significant at the group level in response to the formant perturbations. This suggests that successful perceptual learning for degraded speech is not sufficient for successful sensorimotor learning with degraded auditory feedback.",

          "abstract": "Group-level averaging of psychophysiological data often obscures meaningful individual differences, masking response patterns that may explain variability in behavior and central nervous system activity. Identifying such patterns is particularly relevant in heart rate (HR) responses to threat, where subtle variations may reflect distinct coping mechanisms such as orienting or defense. Machine learning techniques that learn latent representations, particularly variational autoencoders (VAEs), offer powerful tools for revealing such hidden structures.\nThis methodological report introduces a simple VAE-based approach for characterizing HR responses to threat pictures in 165 participants. To validate the method, simulations first demonstrated that the model accurately separated noisy sine and cosine waveforms. The VAE was then applied to empirical HR responses, mapping them into a two-dimensional latent space for subsequent cluster analysis, which was compared to clustering based directly on raw HR waveforms.\nThe VAE revealed three distinct response profiles: (1) strong decelerators (fear bradycardia), (2) weak decelerators with late acceleration, and (3) immediate accelerators without a decelerative phase. In contrast, clustering raw HR waveforms identified only two groups. Clusters derived from the latent space were more coherent and exhibited greater within-group consistency. Finally, applying the pre-trained autoencoder to a small fear-conditioning dataset enabled characterization of distinct HR response patterns despite limited sample size. These findings show that even a basic autoencoder enhances the categorization of psychophysiological response patterns, offering a framework for linking individual autonomic variability to broader models of affective and defensive behavior.",

We move beyond such comparisons to examine how cognitive processes might shape this relationship. In a pre-registered longitudinal study, we applied computational modelling to repeated decision-making tasks to test whether preference for immediate rewards moderates the longitudinal relationship between social media use and mental health. Adolescents with a greater preference for immediate rewards exhibited larger declines in behavioural activation as social media use increased. This effect was consistent across timepoints, indicating heightened vulnerability among those favouring immediate gratification. No moderation was observed for other mental health outcomes, and delay discounting was unrelated to time spent on social media or compulsive internet use. Cognitive processes could therefore provide insights into individual differences in social media’s mental health effects, offering future mechanistic explanations and potential targets for intervention.",

This dynamism isn’t captured by existing systems consolidation theories that predict a unidirectional process where memories are first supported by the hippocampus and then the neocortex. I propose a three-dimensional state-space for episodic memories. The first two dimensions relate to whether episodic retrieval is driven by the hippocampus and the neocortex, critically allowing for independent and additive contributions from both regions. The third dimension relates to the episodic-specificity of retrieval. Memories can be located at any point in this state-space and move to any other location. The state-space captures the dynamic nature of episodic memory and broadens the search space of possible memory states and transformations across time.",

We ran a pre-registered study with UK adults (N = 150, Prolific) where participants rated the value to them of 41 different monthly incomes (£1–£8000; random order). Comparing the fit of different classes of function, the most frequent best fit was sigmoid (59% of respondents; quadratic 37%; linear 5%). Generalized Additive Models corroborated the S-shape: the mean first derivative rose at low incomes and fell at higher incomes, while the mean second derivative was positive at low incomes and negative thereafter, with the inflection around £1,600/month. Exact question wording did not appear to affect the shape. The midpoint of the S-shape increased with respondents’ own income and the typical income of people they know. Thus, in this population, directly elicited psychological utility functions for income appear to be S-shaped, consistent with earlier findings and the Desperation Threshold Model: marginal utility increases up to a basic-needs threshold and decreases beyond it. Because the inflection lies at an income level actually experience by millions of Britons, these findings have potentially important implications for understanding real-world behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Even in today’s high-choice media landscape, people are drawn to stories of crime and murder, best exemplified by the massive appeal of the true crime genre. Interestingly, while studies report negative effects of violent media on consumers, newer avenues in horror research suggest that frightening media may act as training grounds for coping with anxiety. We investigated both perspectives in a two-week daily diary study on positive and negative affect (anxiety, anger) and true crime consumption (data collected in 2024). Cross-lagged multilevel modelling (Bayesian estimation) was applied to data of n = 199 participants to examine if affect on day n predicted true crime consumption on the following day (n + 1) and vice versa. We found that today’s anxiety positively predicted violent true crime consumption of tomorrow, and in turn, violent true crime consumption of today positively predicted positive affect of tomorrow. These findings corroborate the idea that anxiety may motivate engagement with self-relevant negative media worlds like true crime for emotion regulation, which may yield affective benefits. Conversely, we did not find that true crime consumption increased anxiety or anger, which adds nuances to the idea of fear and aggression cultivation by crime portrayals in the media.",

Drawing on a positive psychology perspective, we aimed to investigate how parenting joy and perceived partner responsiveness covary during this time and how they are related to the longer-term development of parenthood regret. We collected 35 days of experience sampling data, complemented by baseline and follow-up measures, from 269 parents in the United Kingdom (13,249 total observations). Using dynamic structural equation modeling (DSEM), we examined the within-person dynamics between momentary parenting joy and momentary perceived partner responsiveness. At the between-person level, we explored how participants’ average levels of these momentary experiences predicted changes in parenthood regret from baseline to follow-up. DSEM revealed a unidirectional, positive prediction from perceived partner responsiveness to parenting joy at the within-person level. At the between-person level, person means of joy moderated parenthood regret from baseline to follow-up, after relevant sociodemographic variables were controlled for. These findings contribute to the emerging literature on parenthood regret by emphasizing the role of daily emotional experiences and partner dynamics in shaping parental identity. Practically speaking, even small everyday adjustments in family interactions may meaningfully dampen parenthood regret.",

Evidence for such a role is typically based upon the ways neurons reliably respond to specific stimuli. In a recent paper, Pohl et. al. (2024) have offered a more formalized account of neural representation evidence that utilizes Shannon’s information theory. Despite the ingenuity of their theory, we argue that Pohl et. al. fail to present a successful account of evidence for neural representation, and indeed, repeat common mistakes that other researchers make in supporting neural representations.  We offer a more in-depth and rigorous analysis of such evidence, and argue for a more skeptical conclusion: What commonly gets presented as evidence for neural representations actually isn’t.  While we support the reality of cognitive representations at higher levels of analysis, we do not believe compelling evidence has been presented that supports assigning a representational role for neural states and structures.",

          "abstract": "Humans act together to achieve feats they could never achieve alone and communicate to ensure alignment of meaning and understanding across different individuals. Explaining the unique human joint action and communication abilities poses an enormous challenge because it requires a systematic account of how people go beyond their own individual perceptions, thoughts, and needs to achieve joint outcomes and align their understanding. Here, we advance a new unified computational framework for explaining joint action and communication. It builds upon influential predictive processing architectures, extending them from individual cognition to multiagent, interactive settings. We assume that joint action and communication involve using and updating agent-neutral models that enable co-agents to predict collective outcomes of interactions regardless of who achieved them. This contrasts with previous frameworks postulating that agent-specific models predict action outcomes for self and others. We discuss three key claims derived from our framework: 1) Co-agents use agent-neutral predictive frameworks during joint action; 2) Co-agents update agent-neutral models interactively by shaping others’ predictions through verbal and non-verbal communication; and 3) Agent-neutral models enable dynamic role allocation during joint action. We highlight how these three claims stem from our proposal, what evidence currently favors or disfavors them, and what novel experiments could be conducted to test them further. Our agent-neutral predictive processing framework will provide a new perspective for understanding the individual basis of human sociality, which closely links theories of joint action and communication to principles of computational neuroscience.",

          "abstract": "Effective instruction should not only enhance immediate performance but also prepare learners to succeed when learning independently in novel situations (new learning). This study examined which timing and frequency strategies of instruction most effectively foster new learning. We compared six strategies, inspired by theories of motivation (e.g., self-determination theory) and cognition (e.g., testing effect), with two control conditions (no-instruction and full-instruction). Across three experiments (total N = 1,522), participants performed a category learning task. They first received instruction through feature highlighting, whose timing and frequency varied across conditions. Subsequently, their performance was assessed in an independent session where they learned new categories without instruction. An adaptive strategy that tailored instruction to learner performance significantly outperformed the control conditions in initial experiments (Experiments 1 and 2). However, this effect was not observed in a comprehensive experiment (Experiment 3), suggesting that adaptivity itself may not have been the beneficial factor. Instead, an overall examination suggested that the beneficial effects were attributable to two underlying instructional patterns shared by the conditions that outperformed the control conditions: (1) providing instruction in successive sequences, and (2) interspersing tests without instruction by restricting the frequency of instruction. Instructional strategies with these two patterns yielded a significant advantage over the control conditions for independently discovering correct knowledge in novel situations, although they did not reliably improve generalization of that knowledge to other items. This integration of instructional patterns appears to foster new learning by balancing the useful information from instruction with the desirable difficulty of testing.",

A widespread presumption is that these methods radiated from the United States and Germany outwards to other regions. However, broader evidence, drawing from the medieval Arab world and from later instantiations of laboratory psychology in Japan, China, India, and Argentina, demonstrates that experimental methods in psychology were developed and adapted for a range of contexts and purposes in other world regions. In these regions, laboratory psychology methods were marshalled to successfully effect major social and structural reform. These works are almost entirely absent from the canon of scholars associated with the birth of experimental psychology, yet their impact, like that of James and Wundt, has endured for over a century. The paper analyzes how the prevailing narrative describing the genesis of experimental psychology has been an organizing factor in the field. Recognizing a broader genealogy recognizes the accomplishments of psychological pioneers around the world, articulates the range of impacts that experimental psychology can achieve, and expands the hypothesis space of experimental psychology.",

Powerful computational tools also enable new analyses of high-dimensional data, incorporating feature annotation of the stimuli and model-based evaluation of gaze. These advances in both data collection and analysis are providing new insights into individual differences in both health and disease. Here we discuss four key approaches to modeling eye movement data: saliency-based attention phenotyping, data-driven gaze pattern identification, supervised machine learning classification, and unsupervised clustering. We highlight their advantages in psychiatry research, as they inform better understanding of visual attention, provide more fine-grained characterization of individual differences, and make more powerful clinical predictions.

          "abstract": "Social identity profoundly shapes whom people choose as information sources, constraining exposure to diverse perspectives. While people are motivated to seek accurate information, they systematically avoid outgroup sources even when group membership is irrelevant to the task at hand.  Here we investigate whether artificial intelligence (AI) can circumvent these identity-driven biases in source selection. In Study 1, a nationally representative sample of American adults (n = 1,054) preferred AI over human sources when seeking information about political conflicts. In Study 2 (n = 284), an incentivized political fact-checking experiment revealed that participants preferred AI sources over outgroup (d = 0.470) and even ingroup (d = 0.230) partisan sources, despite recognizing they were of equal competence. In Study 3 (n = 277), using an identity-irrelevant shape categorization task, participants only preferred AI over outgroup sources (d = 0.191), with no difference between AI and ingroup sources. Computational modeling revealed that these preferences emerge through selectively accumulated evidence against partisan advisors during deliberation, rather than differences in priors. These findings suggest that AI's perceived neutrality enables it to bypass identity-based discrimination. These results highlight the potential of AI to reduce echo chambers and broaden epistemic exposure by serving as an identity-neutral conduit for information acquisition.",

          "abstract": "Early childhood (3- to 5-years of age) is a period marked by significant developmental changes in the brain. This development underlies age-related improvements in several domains – including language, memory, and socioemotional skills. However, assessing changes in brain structure and function during this period using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) poses several challenges. For example, difficulty remaining still, maintaining attention for long periods and non-compliance in performing behavioral responses in the scanner are particularly prevalent issues. Technological advances in neuroimaging techniques over the past decade have significantly improved success rates for pediatric neuroimaging studies. For example, shorter scan durations and real-time monitoring and correction of motion during scanning have proven especially valuable in acquiring reliable data. However, developmental researchers must still be creative in order to adequately prepare young participants for the scanning environment and, subsequently, ensure the data acquired can be used to address the questions of interest. The success of these sessions has become paramount with the onset of large, multi-site consortium studies such as the HEALthy Child and Brain Development study, which seek to track normative and atypical brain development across the first ten years of life. To this end, the current report provides a pediatric neuroimaging protocol to improve young children’s scanning experience and developmental neuroimaging data quality.",

          "abstract": "Emotion regulation strategies play a critical role in helping people manage stressors and maintain psychological well-being. Understanding the efficacy and boundary conditions of regulatory strategies—as they are implemented in response to stressors in daily life—is especially important for college-aged students, a population that has been experiencing chronically high levels of depression and anxiety in recent years. Here, we utilized ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to capture college students’ use of multiple emotion regulation strategies in response to idiosyncratic, real-world stressors, as well as the effects of strategy use on momentary stress levels and momentary affect. Following a preregistered analytic plan, we first combined two EMA samples from Rice University and Bard College (N=159) to examine effects of strategy use on momentary affect. We also investigated the influence of factors that could interact with strategy use, namely momentary fluctuations in mental exhaustion and people’s general propensity to experience distress in the first place. Some results were consistent with our preregistered, a priori hypotheses, with rumination negatively associated with momentary affect, but use of other strategies did not significantly predict changes in momentary affect. Contrary to our predictions, efficacy of reappraisal slightly increased at higher levels of mental exhaustion. Exploratory analyses revealed that the number of adaptive strategies positively predicted momentary affect and the number of maladaptive strategies negatively predicted momentary affect. Overall, this study contributes to the growing body of research on the variable effects of emotion regulation strategies in real-world contexts. Our findings also speak to the dynamic interplay between strategy type/tactic, situational factors, and individual characteristics to drive changes in momentary affect.",

          "abstract": "Memory distortions emerge from a complex interplay between prior knowledge and ongoing experience—dynamics which are not readily provoked in controlled laboratory experiments. Here we investigate naturally occurring memory distortions using the largest known dataset of narrative recall, comprising hundreds of spoken recollections. Using large language models (LLMs), we developed an automated pipeline to detect and classify spontaneous false memories. Across two validation experiments, we demonstrate that human-AI agreement matches inter-human reliability in detecting and cataloging memory distortions. We show that false memories reflect two distinct phenomena which are driven by separable semantic factors: similarity to prototypical narrative patterns drives factual errors (distortions of actual content), whereas contextual surprise drives confabulations (entirely fabricated details). Through this combination of large-scale naturalistic data and AI-powered automation tools, we reveal memory processes that controlled laboratory paradigms cannot easily capture and illuminate the complex dynamics of human (mis)remembering in real-world contexts.",

          "abstract": "Language provides a window onto how people conceptualize their subjective experiences, including emotions. Although rare, linguistic analyses that go beyond emotion words provide deep insights into emotional experience across cultures. In this study, we explored cultural models of emotions prevalent in the US and Belgium using verbal descriptions of recent emotional events collected from speakers of North American (US) English and Belgian Dutch in form of semi-structured interviews. We analyzed the interviews in three stages: 1) topic modeling to characterize content, 2) word counting to examine linguistic resources, and 3) inductive analysis to uncover broader themes. Our findings revealed notable cultural differences alongside some similarities. US English speakers used more first-person pronouns and emotion words, emphasized high-arousal emotions, and prioritized asserting personal achievements and openly expressing their feelings. In contrast, Belgian Dutch speakers’ descriptions reflected a more moderated approach to emotions, illustrating how social standards and broader worldviews gave meaning to the events, with use of fewer first-person pronouns and more language focused on relativization and comparison. Taken together, our observations are consistent with previous psychological research on US and Belgian culture. We evaluate our approach against other means of exploring the conceptualization of emotion across cultures.",

          "abstract": "Recently, researchers have proposed that the Belief in a Just World comprises two dimensions: Effort-based Belief in a Just World (EBJW), focusing on the relationship between effort and reward, and Valence-based Belief in a Just World (VBJW), centering on the association of good and bad behavior with consequences. This research aimed to develop and validate standardized measures of EBJW and VBJW in English. Following item generation and selection, an initial list was administered to a US sample (n = 311). Subsequently, a refined list was administered to a second US sample (n = 276). The final measures demonstrated excellent reliabilities and strong convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity. For instance, egocentric selfishness was negatively related to VBJW but not to EBJW, and VBJW explained variance in egocentric selfishness beyond what was accounted for by General Belief in a Just World. This underscores the potential of these concepts and measurements to elucidate mechanisms underlying various justice-related phenomena.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Emerging research suggests that caregiver oral reading prosody may be a key feature of shared reading that supports children’s storybook comprehension, with potential implications for broader language development. Building on this evidence, the present study investigated whether associations between caregiver oral reading prosody and children’s language at the preschool age extend beyond real-time listening comprehension to include broader language skills.  \nMethods: Forty-one caregivers read a children’s book to their child (ages: 4–5 years) as they normally would at home. The caregivers’ oral reading prosody (intonation, timing, and loudness features) was examined in relation to children’s receptive vocabulary and core language skills. Moderated mediation models then investigated possible impacts of caregiver reading skills and shared reading time on putative links between caregiver oral reading prosody and child language.\nResults: Caregiver intonation range positively related to child receptive vocabulary and caregiver inappropriate (i.e., ungrammatical) pausing negatively related to child core language skills. Mediation models revealed that caregiver reading skills indirectly related to child language skills through oral reading prosody. Importantly, the indirect effect linking caregiver reading skills to child receptive vocabulary via caregiver intonation range was moderated by shared reading time, with the strongest effects observed in dyads reporting less shared reading engagement. \nConclusions: Findings illuminate caregiver oral reading prosody as one factor linking caregiver reading skills to child language, with effects through caregiver intonation on child vocabulary most evident in families with limited shared reading engagement. Overall, this research has implications for early language intervention approaches, especially among families of caregivers with reading difficulties and for those with limited shared reading opportunities.",

          "abstract": "When asked where they have previously looked, people rarely report their visual behaviour correctly. However, previous tasks have probed participants’ awareness of their gaze behaviour through explicit measures, like recognition, and it remains unclear whether poor awareness is also seen in implicit measures. We investigated this with a novel tracking paradigm in which participants first completed a visual search task while their eye movements were recorded. Next, participants completed a tracking task where they followed a moving red dot on the screen with their eyes. In Experiment 1, the dot replayed either their own previously recorded gaze position or that of another participant. We measured tracking performance by cross-correlating the previously recorded gaze position with the tracked positions. Participants were not significantly faster or more accurate in tracking their own eye movements compared to another participant’s. Experiment 2 tested this with a more extreme manipulation, in which participants tracked either unaltered or temporally reversed sequences of their own eye movements, which resulted in higher accuracy in the forward compared to the reversed condition. Finally, Experiment 3 examined whether performance would decrease when participants tracked a participant with very dissimilar gaze behaviour from their own. Tracking performance was similar when tracking their own scanpath compared to a dissimilar participant, but participants’ tracking latencies were shorter when tracking a participant with consistent scanning behaviour. Overall, our results suggest that though awareness of one’s eye movements is generally poor, extreme manipulations, like temporally reversing one’s eye movements, can influence tracking performance.",

          "abstract": "Sometimes people miss the “good old days” of their country. This national nostalgia can\nfuel populist movements worldwide, rallying supporters with promises of restored glory.\nSocio-psychological work has characterized national nostalgia as a coping mechanism for\ncollective self-discontinuity, but it remains theoretically unclear which aspect of collective\nidentity (e.g., national, political, or moral) is most central in shaping national nostalgia.\nWe propose the Moral Nostalgia Hypothesis (MNH), which posits that moral identity is\ncentral. MNH predicts trait sensitivity, meaning that people who prioritize moral values\nare dispositionally prone to national nostalgia, and threat sensitivity, meaning that\nperceived moral decline evokes nostalgia more strongly than economic decline as a\nsituational response. We test MNH across four studies in 20 societies (N = 4,924) using\nsurveys and two centuries of English and Chinese texts. Values tied to hierarchy and\ntradition emerged as the strongest dispositional predictors of national nostalgia, even after\ncontrolling for multiple individual- and societal-level variables, while perceived fairness\ndecline was the most powerful situational trigger. These findings identify moral identity\ncontent, rather than material welfare or generic group cues, as the key mechanism linking\ncollective self-discontinuity to national nostalgia, illuminating why nostalgic political\nrhetoric framed as moral restoration resonates so powerfully.",

Using validated instruments, we employed linear regression models to analyze trends and Cohen’s d to pinpoint critical transition points, with analyses stratified by gender and school type. Results revealed a non-linear trajectory, characterized by a significant decline in most attitude and identity constructs during the transition to secondary school (6th-7th grade), followed by a rebound in the 8th-grade cohort. This decline was more pronounced among girls, particularly in self-efficacy and Science Identity. While both school types showed a similar decrease in Science Identity, private schools exhibited a protective effect on students' self-efficacy and perceived utility of science.

          "abstract": "Youth differ in how strongly they respond to environmental influences, with some individuals demonstrating greater sensitivity to both adverse and supportive contexts. Environmental sensitivity (ES) has emerged as a unifying framework encompassing theories such as differential susceptibility, biological sensitivity to context, and vantage sensitivity. This scoping review examined sensitivity as a moderator of the relationship between environmental exposures and mental health outcomes in children and adolescents. The review aimed to (1) identify key markers used to approximate individual differences in sensitivity and (2) examine the methods used to measure these markers across studies. A total of 34 articles representing 37 studies were included. Markers of ES fell into five categories: phenotypic (e.g., temperament, sensitivity), genetic (e.g., 5HTTLPR, DRD4), physiological (e.g., cortisol, vagal tone), biological (e.g., prematurity), and neurobiological (e.g., amygdala activation). Phenotypic markers were most commonly studied, primarily assessed through parent- or youth-report questionnaires. Sensitivity was found to moderate the effects of various environments on mental health, with differential susceptibility emerging as the most consistently supported theoretical model. Assessment approaches varied widely in measurement tools, informants, and analytic methods depending on the marker used. Few studies used multi-informant or longitudinal methods. This review highlights the value of identifying sensitive youth who may be more responsive to both risk and protective factors and highlights the need for more methodologically rigorous research to guide personalized prevention and intervention efforts within an ES framework.",

Among the most prevalent causes for WM impairment affecting military personnel, TBI and mTBI have been the most pervasive and consistently on the rise worldwide. Hence, current research efforts have been made to investigate relevant brain areas, cortical and subcortical regions, and cognitive functions related to WM impairment in military personnel. The aim of this review is to identify brain areas, cortical and subcortical regions, and cognitive functions related to WM impairment in military personnel from a selection of recent studies in order to inform novel clinical applications, including cognitive rehabilitation methodologies, for the benefit of individuals suffering from WM impairment. Affected brain areas included the VLPFC, DLPFC, VMPFC, OFC, FP, hippocampus, dorsolateral and orbitofrontal striatal circuits, and caudate nucleus. Identified disruptions to cognitive functions included slower reaction times, lower WM performance and accuracy in delayed visual and verbal abilities, and worse neuropsychological performance. Future research should focus on the cross-examination of underexplored WM impairment causes and affected brain areas and cognitive functions.\n\nKeywords: military personnel, working memory, impairment, traumatic brain injury, cognitive impairment, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, striatal circuits",

          "abstract": "The number of dogs in Western countries has increased over the past 2 decades, whereas the number of children has remained stable or decreased. Many dog owners, including those with children, say that their pets are more important to them than any human. Presumably, the declining fertility rates contribute to the increasing value of dogs in the lives of people, and dogs fill an empty niche. The companion-dog cultural-runaway theory posits that the change in dog-keeping habits has both biological and cultural evolutionary roots. Human ancestors developed a cooperative breeding system 2 million years ago, with the community aiding in child-rearing. Because people currently do not perceive the level of social support and trust to which they are biologically adapted, they seek alternatives. One coping strategy may involve transferring genetically based prosocial attitudes, such as the tendency to engage in parental behavior, to dogs. Western culture supports this shift and portrays dog ownership positively. Moreover, the biological evolution of dogs, with the spread of short-headed, small-sized lapdogs, also contributes to them being viewed as “children.” Dogs may facilitate or hinder the restoration of human network complexity, but this area is currently largely unexplored.",

Our referential expressions help listeners efficiently find what we’re talking about by strategically adding color or material words as needed. But most conversations are about things that are not physically in front of us. In these cases, do we also use language to efficiently help a listener retrieve an item from memory? Across two experiments, we asked participants to describe images to help a listener recall each image. In Experiment 1 (total n = 600), participants spontaneously incorporated expectations about memorability, providing relatively more description for images that people expect to be less memorable. In Experiment 2 (n = 300), we replicated this pattern even when participants had no access to or knowledge of their listener’s prior experience. Interestingly, people’s descriptions were more aligned with subjective estimates of memorability, rather than objective, empirically-derived metrics. Together, this work provides new evidence that speakers spontaneously guide listeners’ mental processes to effectively facilitate their memory recall.",

          "abstract": "Class differences in aptitude testing are often attributed to working-class deficiencies in a host of basic cognitive skills. The present research challenges this deficit narrative in the context of logical reasoning. We argue that reasoning tests often privilege abstract styles of reasoning as a \"neutral\" benchmark and provide a poor match to social-cognitive competencies promoted in working-class contexts. We evaluate this hypothesis in archival data from an international study of mathematical aptitude (N = 158,216), a pre-registered nationally-representative experiment on logical deduction (N = 781), and an integrative data analysis (IDA) combining data from Study 2 with three supplemental studies (N = 2,269). In Study 1, reasoning items higher in social-relational content (i.e., mentions of people) yielded smaller class gaps among eighth-grade students from 46 countries. Study 2 and the IDA experimentally replicate and extend these findings, demonstrating that reframing an abstract reasoning task to recruit social-cognitive skills reduces class-based performance differences among adults. Study 2 and the IDA also highlight that these effects cannot be explained by the mere inclusion of real-world content (e.g., money, food), but are most robustly produced by content invoking social relations. Our results support a cultural-psychological account of reasoning performance, highlight working-class strengths in social reasoning, and point to inclusive approaches to testing as a way to attenuate social-class gaps in aptitude testing performance.",

          "abstract": "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) can be quantified using a myriad of mathematical indices, but the lack of systematic and empirical comparison between these indices complicates the evaluation and interpretation of HRV data. This study assessed the reliability, consistency, and generalizability of the structural relationships among 89 HRV indices using a consensus-clustering approach. We analyzed 635 short-term resting-state electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings from two samples of college students with differing psychological profiles. Results from a sample with elevated internalizing symptoms (N=233)—collected across two sessions, one week apart—were compared to evaluate the test-retest reliability of the HRV clusters. To further assess the stability and generalizability of these HRV clusters beyond individuals with elevated internalizing symptoms, these results were compared with a second sample not selected based on psychological symptoms (N=203). We identified 19 clusters of 70 HRV indices with cross-method, test-retest, and cross-sample robustness. Based on the robust empirical convergence and the relative popularity of some HRV indices in the extant literature, we recommend 13 HRV indices for short-term recordings of resting-state HRV (under 10 minutes): RMSSD, SDNN, RSA (Porges-Bohrer or Peak-to-Trough method), RSA (Gates method), SD1/SD2 or CSI, ApEn or SampEn, HF or LnHF, DFA α1, DFA α2, one of the MDFA α1 features, one of the MDFA α2 features, one of the heart rate asymmetry indices, and one of the heart rate fragmentation indices. This approach mitigates the biases that can arise from redundant or highly correlated indices, facilitates clearer interpretation, and enhances the validity of conclusions drawn from HRV analyses.",

          "abstract": "Computational models of auditory salience predict that acoustic change and divergence from prediction increase the salience of sound streams. Confirming these predictions, prior research has shown that acoustic change and unpredictable sound features are linked to increases in physiological arousal and disruption of concurrent task performance. However, it remains unclear whether linguistic features, such as phonemic and lexical/semantic surprisal, help drive attentional orienting, or whether instead attentional capture takes place prior to linguistic analysis. To address this question, we introduce a new technique for assessing attentional capture by naturalistic task-irrelevant speech. In this paradigm participants tap to a metronome while ignoring a spoken passage from an audiobook. Salient features of the task-irrelevant speech capture attention, increase arousal, and expand subjective time, leading to shifts in tap timing. We show that distortions of subjective time are driven not only by acoustic change but also by phonemic surprisal. Thus, attentional orienting to sound takes place after the initial stages of linguistic analysis.",

          "abstract": "Back in 1961, Donald Hebb established a classic paradigm for studying repetition learning: He asked participants to remember several memory sets for an immediate serial recall task and repeated one set multiple times throughout the experiment. Participants’ ability to recall the repeated set improved gradually with repetitions, thereby demonstrating repetition learning. Explaining this effect has concerned researchers for decades, as it provides key insights into how we form durable memory representations through repeated exposure. In this review, we revisit the dominant views on the mechanisms underlying repetition learning, thereby challenging two central assumptions: The assumption that repetition learning is gradual, and the assumption that it is implicit. We show how these views have emerged from flawed analytical approaches, summarize recent evidence strongly contradicting these claims, and present a re-analysis of previously published data to illustrate how correcting implausible analytical assumptions leads to different theoretical conclusions. We propose an updated theoretical framework of the cognitive mechanisms underlying repetition learning in which we integrate elements from previous models of the Hebb repetition effect with established models of episodic memory, thereby joining two branches of the memory literature.",

Nine graphical Gaussian models (GGMs) were conducted: for each disorder, across three time phases (assessment to start-of-treatment; start to mid-point of treatment; mid-point to end-of-treatment). Each GGM included 19 nodes, based on PHQ-9, GAD-7 and NHS TTad phobia scores, using residuals as indices of change for each node. \n\nNetworks of symptom change were largely similar. Estimated network matrix similarity ranged between r =.74 and r = .91 across disorders, with depression and GAD networks more similar to each other than to panic disorder. Networks varied over time within the same disorder, more so for panic disorder (r = .61-.63) than GAD (r = .86-.90) or depression (r = .87-.93). There were close links between changes in worry-related items and feeling nervous or anxious, and between depressed mood and anhedonia across all networks, as well as links between sleep disturbance, appetite, trouble relaxing and irritability.\n\nFindings suggest shared patterns of co-change across anxiety and depression. There is a potential indication that therapy may work by leveraging existing natural change mechanisms rather than by creating entirely new patterns of symptom interaction.

          "authors": "Laurence Cobbaert; Ellen Maloney; Keir Harding; Sandi James",
          "abstract": "This paper presents a perspective grounded in critical psychiatry and decolonial epistemologies, synthesising interdisciplinary scholarship and lived experience testimony to interrogate the diagnostic construct of borderline personality disorder (BPD) as a site of iatrogenic harm and epistemic violence. Clinical discourse commonly positions long-term therapeutic engagement as a risk factor for “dependence,” framing care recipients as the locus of complication. Rather than accepting this premise, we locate harm within systemic, relational and epistemic practices embedded in psychiatric culture. We argue that conditionality, pathologising interpretations of support needs and punitive framings of self-advocacy produce iatrogenic harm, whereas consistent and validating therapeutic relationships foster safety and autonomy. Using a decolonial theoretical lens, this work critiques the misogynistic origins of the “dependence myth” and traces how Western attachment theory has been universalised to pathologise kinship forms outside nuclear family models, particularly in Indigenous, Black, migrant and collectivist communities. We further highlight how sensory processing differences are neglected in BPD discourse despite their significant role in self-injury, suicidality and embodied distress, calling for an expanded framework beyond relational psychodynamic explanations. Diagnostic bias toward sexually and gender diverse people is examined as a continuation of psychiatry’s historic regulation of gender and sexuality through personality pathology paradigms. Ultimately, we contend that the BPD construct functions less as a neutral clinical category and more as a colonial, cisheteronormative, and neuronormative governance technology that produces pathology through stigma, epistemic control, and carceral logics. Reframing BPD as a diagnostic instrument of social regulation rather than a disorder located within individuals opens space for care grounded in relational justice, cultural flexibility, sensory attunement, human rights, and epistemic humility, rather than the castigating of Western social nonconformity and the enforcement of compliance with normative behavioural conditioning.",

          "abstract": "Rhythm, such as in music, contains structure in the form of rhythmic patterns: the more or less predictable successions of longer and shorter intervals (i.e., the “morse code” of the rhythm). Listeners can use rhythmic patterns to predict the timing of sounds and guide their perception and action. It is still unclear how rhythmic patterns are represented in the human mind. Here, we used a probabilistic model of auditory expectations to simulate the perception and production of rhythmic patterns. We modelled expectations in rhythmic sequences at three different levels of abstraction: as the predictability of absolute inter-onset intervals (IOI), ratios between successive intervals (ratio), and the direction of change of successive intervals (contour). Subsequently, we selected rhythms that varied maximally in their modeled predictability across the three levels of abstraction for three behavioral tasks: a target detection task in which the rhythm was not task-relevant (implicit task), a complexity rating task (explicit task), and a tapping task (motor task). We found that both ratio and contour affected behavioral responses across all tasks, with the largest effects in the explicit rating task. IOI only affected responses for the explicit and motor tasks, where the rhythm was task-relevant, and to a greater extent when an imprecise, categorical representation of IOI was assumed. These findings suggest that humans rely mostly on imprecise representations of rhythmic patterns, but may flexibly adapt their representation based on task demands.",

          "abstract": "Social interactions are influenced by personality traits such as approach-avoidance motives. However, it remains unclear how traits, states, and interpersonal perceptions interact to shape everyday social experiences – and for whom their interactions are most consequential. Addressing this gap is critical for advancing personality-in-context models and identifying mechanisms underlying deficits in interpersonal functioning. A two-week Ecological Momentary Assessment was conducted with 136 participants (N = 3,991 social interactions), who reported on motivational states, partner perceptions, and interaction preferences. The combined model integrating traits, states, and perceptions best predicted interaction preferences. Higher approach-related traits, states, and perceptions predicted increased interaction preference, whereas avoidance-related traits, states, and perceptions predicted lower interaction preference. Exploratory analyses revealed that maladaptive interpersonal functioning amplified the negative effects of avoidance trait and state motives on social evaluations. Integrating trait and state perspectives offers valuable insights for understanding social functioning, particularly in individuals at risk for interpersonal difficulties.",

We report on the development and validation of a 6-item deepfake myths acceptance scale (DMAS) over 3 studies (n = 1080) which consist of an Exploratory Factor Analysis, a Confirmatory Factor Analysis and a second Confirmatory Factor Analysis, which focused specifically on high-perpetrating populations. The scale has strong psychometric properties (Cronbach's α = .87) and moderately correlates with self-reported past behaviours and future intentions to watch, share, and create deepfakes.  The scale takes approximately 2 minutes to complete and is a useful tool for researchers who seek to understand the individuals and communities that produce and share deepfakes. We also encourage researchers to utilise the deepfake myth acceptance measure to assess the effectiveness of interventions at changing the attitudes/beliefs that underpin deepfake abuse.",

This can impact the desired error rates in statistical hypothesis testing. Robust tests like the Mann–Whitney U test and robust linear regression do not rely on assumptions such as normality and equal variances. Using them can counteract non-replicated findings that are just due to data anomalies, such as extreme values and outliers, which occur differently across studies. Employing them from the outset bypasses the pitfalls of deciding on the usability of a standard test with data. In this opinion piece, I summarize the epistemic benefits of robust alternatives. Restricting to a robust test instead of conducting it in addition to the standard test avoids generating multiple results, thus counteracting fishing for the desired, which can occur subtly. From a practical standpoint, running a single test simplifies analysis, and many robust methods are readily available in R. However, it is important to understand what a robust method does and what it is actually robust against. I also address common defenses of standard tests, discuss why they remain widespread, and suggest how these arguments should be countered.",

          "abstract": "Background. Humans have cognitive abilities that enable them to decide about taking precautions, such as avoiding predators, detoxifying food, and possibly taking vaccinations. By hypothesis, these cognitive abilities include reasoning about and applying precaution rules, such as taking precautionary actions conditional upon being exposed to a hazard (i.e., perceived threat) and belief that the precautionary action protects against the hazard (i.e., coping appraisal). Whereas standard health psychology models typically treat the perceived threat and coping appraisal as two separate factors, the precaution rule entails that they should be treated in conjunction. In this study, we tested (i) whether people’s stated vaccination intentions are in line with reasoning according to the precaution rule, (ii) under which circumstances they reason according to the precaution rule, and (iii) how the perceived threat and coping appraisal are associated with individual differences in worldviews. Method. We used a cross-sectional survey (Study 1, N = 923–1,575) and a mixed-subject experiment (Study 2, N = 811) with respondents from the Netherlands. Results. While threat and coping appraisals were related to vaccination intentions, respondents did not reason according to the precaution rule, irrespective of the circumstances. The threat and coping appraisals were associated with participants’ worldviews and partially mediated the association between these worldviews and vaccination intentions. Conclusion. Vaccination intentions are related to appraisals about threat and coping, but people do not use these appraisals in the normative manner proposed by the precaution rule.",

          "abstract": "Elderly people and patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s Disease (PD) immensely rely on arithmetic skills to lead an independent life. Activities such as medication management, financial transactions or using public transport require intact abilities to manipulate numbers with different arithmetic operations. However, research on cognitive deficits in PD has been focussing on domain-general functions such as executive functions, attention or working memory so far – largely neglecting potential domain-specific aspects of numerical cognition (e.g., carry or problem size effect). These aspects should be addressed, as PD-immanent deterioration of domain-specific numerical areas and domain-general functions suggests mechanisms of both primary and secondary (mediated by other cognitive deficits) arithmetic deficits, respectively. The current study systematically investigated arithmetic performance and effects in PD patients differing in cognitive impairment for the first time, targeting domain-specific cognitive representations of arithmetic as well as the influence of domain-general factors. Besides healthy controls (HC), PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) and PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) were compared in arithmetic performance in the four basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). The deficits consisted of problems in two-digit addition and subtraction and PD-MCI, as well as delayed arithmetic fact retrieval for single-digit multiplication and division in PD-NC and PD-MCI. Deficits were not domain-specific, as arithmetic effects (problem size, carry, and borrow effects) did not differ between the groups. Discriminant analyses showed that performance in addition, multiplication and division tasks could differentiate between PD-NC and PD-MCI. The study results help us to understand the underlying mechanisms of arithmetic deficits faced by PD patients in daily life.",

          "abstract": "It was repeatedly found that when speakers produced a word, such as “lion”, they were slowed by a constant amount of time for each previously produced word from the same semantic category, for example the words “elephant” or “zebra”. That is, there was a linear relationship between the ordinal position of a category exemplar in the experimental list and the naming latency. This cumulative semantic interference effect observed in the context of the continuous picture naming task is the main motivation for adaptive models of word production. Notably, all studies reporting this effect have examined the interference only across five (or six in one case) ordinal positions. We investigated whether this linear increase continues when testing ten or fifteen ordinal positions. Inconsistent with the predictions of current adaptive models, but consistent with evidence from the learning literature, we found that the increase in the interference was restricted. Additionally, we found that the interference decreased with a long lag (introducing unrelated naming episodes) and that its developmental trajectory was similar before and after the lag. These findings require an adjustment to existing adaptive models of word production.",

          "abstract": "Generalization enables individuals to apply knowledge derived from past experiences in novel situations, yet it is unclear whether common experimental paradigms probe the same underlying ability in early to middle childhood. We assessed 84 children aged 4, 6, and 8 years on four paradigms, namely statistical learning, associative inference, transitive inference, and categorization, and examined age effects and cross-task concordance. Accuracy increased with age in every task, but inter-task correlations were weak, suggesting that each paradigm might tap a partly distinct facet of generalization. Focused analyses of the associative and transitive inference task showed that older children’s success increasingly relied on memory for directly learned pairs. In younger children, the weak memory–generalization link diverged by task: 4- and 6-year-olds often solved transitive inferences without accurate pair memory, whereas such increased memory-independent generalization was not evident in associative inference. Computational modeling supported this pattern, indicating that younger children used value-based reinforcement learning to solve transitive problems, whereas 8-year-olds employed a pair-memory strategy. Taken together, our findings show that generalization develops through multiple pathways, underscoring the need for multi-indicator and model-based approaches to capture its multiple facets.",

          "abstract": "The production of a word is delayed by the recent production of one or more semantically related words. This phenomenon, known as semantic interference, has been observed in picture naming tasks involving either large sets of pictures named once (continuous naming) or small sets of pictures named repeatedly (blocked-cyclic naming). It has been attributed to an adaptive learning mechanism that operates after each naming episode. However, the interference develops differently in these tasks: it is cumulative in continuous naming and non-cumulative in blocked-cyclic naming. It has been suggested that the small local response sets in blocked naming are easily identified and stored in working memory, which then introduces an additional process that constrains the interference. We reasoned that this process would be less effective as the local response sets increased in size, resulting in cumulative interference. In blocked naming experiments involving local response sets of ten or nineteen items, we found that the interference did not increase continuously; rather, it carried on across more presentations than for the typically used small sets. This finding lends support to the notion of a control mechanism that operates gradually and interacts with an adaptive learning mechanism.",

          "abstract": "Background/Aims: Loot boxes are randomised in-game monetisation mechanisms that share similarities with gambling. Although previous studies summarised the intricacy of loot box design based on random reward mechanism, there is no specific framework linking the characteristics of loot boxes with the gambling-related psychological factors. Therefore, this study aimed to explore loot box features and categorise them into different domains to analyse how these design elements incorporate gambling-related psychological principles to enhance player engagement and monetary expenditure in video games.\nMethods: Based on the Loot Box Features Model and researchers’ lived experience, we developed a codebook identifying 23 gambling-related features capturing six domains: (1) monetary manipulation &amp; investment, (2) psychological manipulation, (3) sensory gambling cues, (4) fear-of-missing-out mechanics, (5) reward structure &amp; probability systems, and (6) social dynamics. We conducted a coding exercise on the first hour of gameplay content from the 20 mobile games based on their grossing, excluding social casino games. Two researchers co-coded an initial subset separately and refined the framework before applying it to the remaining titles.\nFindings: All six domains appeared in the sample, with the highest prevalence in monetary manipulation, psychological manipulation, and fear-of-missing-out. Typical tactics included VIP schemes, limited-time discounts, variable-ratio reinforcement, rarity, and pity systems. The classic gambling resemblance was also found in some games. Social dynamics features showed the lowest prevalence.\nConclusion: This study developed a framework to summarise gambling-related psychological features of loot boxes and initially explored the prevalence of these features in the highest-grossing games. We conclude with a discussion of potential association between these identified features of loot boxes and their potential risks on game players. The limitation of this study is the limited number of sampling games, and the first one-hour recordings are not enough to present full views of these games. Future work should audit longer play windows and validate the framework across regions.",

Some immune signals may reflect assay bias or illness effects; immunogenetic approaches help disentangle cause and correlation. Genetic associations in the extended major histocompatibility complex (MHC) remain of unclear relevance to immunopathogenesis but warrant finer-resolution analysis. Integrating non-MHC risk variants with immunological data implicates especially adaptive immune cells in psychiatric pathogenesis. Epigenetic studies show that resting immune cells carry a ‘poised’ landscape encoding past exposures and predicting future responses, illuminating how genetic variability shapes illness risk from environmental “insults” such as stress and infection. While only some patients may have immune-driven symptoms, the tractability and accessibility of the immune system make it a compelling focus for stratification and therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the role of ethnonationalist sentiment in shaping opposition to abortion in contemporary Europe. Far-right political movements increasingly deploy conspiracist narratives of “native population replacement” to evoke fears about demographic decline, cultural erosion, and the loss of traditional values. We argue that these fears manifest both outwardly, as prejudice toward perceived out-groups, and inwardly, as support for tightening social norms and opposition to practices such as abortion and voluntary childlessness, which are viewed as contributing to the in-group’s demographic and cultural decline. Accordingly, we expect out-group prejudice to be associated with opposition to these practices. To investigate these dynamics, we analyse data from the European Values Study, focusing on perceptions of abortion justifiability. We find that (1) prejudice toward people of other races, Muslims, and migrants is consistently linked to viewing abortion as less justifiable, even after controlling for ideological and socio-demographic factors; (2) these associations has grown stronger over time; and (3) are especially pronounced in countries with a larger share of foreign-born residents from ethnically distinct backgrounds. These findings suggest that abortion opposition in Europe is increasingly intertwined with ethnonationalist views.",

          "abstract": "Purpose. Research on workplace violence has predominantly focused on individual, organizational, and situational risk factors associated with employee victimization. However, limited attention has been paid to the interactional processes that shape workplace violence events despite microsociological theories and evidence underscoring the critical role of face-to-face interactions in conflict situations. This paper proposes a microsociological approach to better understand how workplace encounters escalate into acts of victimization. Methodology. To exemplify the value of a microsociological approach, we analyze body-worn camera footage of a work situation that escalates into aggression between a ticket inspector and a bus passenger without a valid ticket. Using qualitative process analysis, we examine how interactional dynamics involving status and emotions shape the step-by-step progression of this high-risk encounter. Findings. We demonstrate how the imposition of a fine transforms the inspector-passenger interaction into a status negotiation, with passenger aggression emerging in response to the inspector’s exercise of authority. Moreover, the inspector’s emotion management plays a key role in preventing the situation from escalating further into mutual displays of anger and aggression. This case illustrates how a micro-interactional analysis of risky work situations can reveal the mechanisms of violence and inform situational prevention strategies. Implications. We provide methodological and theoretical guidance for incorporating microsociological analysis into workplace violence research. Originality. This study demonstrates how a microsociological approach, grounded in a novel video-observational method, yields unique insights into the interactional dynamics that causally shape incidents of workplace violence.",

In three studies, we investigated the effects of Sonoception on emotional processing and inhibitory control, cortical processing of cardiac signals, and brain activation patterns. In Study 1, participants completed a Go/No-go task with faces showing disgusted or neutral expressions to assess the influence of the auditory stimulation on inhibitory control in emotional contexts. The 6Hz stimulation decreased false alarms for neutral faces, whereas the 2Hz stimulation increased false alarms for disgusted faces. This suggested a facilitatory effect of the 6Hz frequency on inhibitory control and a disinhibitory effect of the 2Hz frequency that enhanced impulsive responses. In Study 2, we assessed the heartbeat-evoked potentials as an index of heart-brain interaction and observed increased amplitude following 6Hz stimulation, suggesting enhanced cortical processing of cardiac signals. In Study 3, passive listening fMRI showed that the 6Hz stimulation selectively activated the left insula compared to the 2Hz condition. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Sonoception exerts distinct effects on behavioral, physiological, and neural functions, supporting the hypothesis that auditory frequency-specific stimulation can modulate cognitive-emotional functions, brain-body interactions and insular activation patterns.",

To answer this, we analysed 24,479 sermon transcripts across 4,925 Christian churches, 1,358 U.S. counties and 6 denominations through bottom-up topic modelling, top-down dictionaries, and variance decomposition analyses. Across thematic focus, moral foundations, personal values, and emotional tone, most differentiation arose between churches, with smaller effects between denominations, and minimal variation between counties. Churches differentiated their sermons across several dimensions, including the use of high-arousal positive emotions and traditional moral values. Denominations differed in their endorsement of liberal versus conservative values and ritual content. Our findings suggest that churches and denominations differentiate their messages to serve distinct niches in America’s religious marketplace, offering new insights into the cultural dynamics of religion.",

Using auditory forced-choice and orthographic tasks with nonce words, we demonstrate that speakers systematically prefer final stress when final syllables contain sonorant codas {N, l, r} compared to the obstruent coda {s}. Our data reveal that coda sonority influences stress preferences beyond traditional weight distinctions. Lexical analysis of monomorphemic words corroborates experimental findings, showing that s-final words receive final stress less frequently than sonorant-final words.",

          "abstract": "Disturbances of emotion are a core feature of psychological disorders generally, and of mood and anxiety disorders in particular. However, it remains unclear what specific patterns of affective disturbance are shared across different symptom domains. Here we examined correlations between emotional disorder symptom severity (anxiety, depression, hypomania, and anhedonia) and affective reactivity to gain and loss outcomes within a decision-making task with embedded sampling of emotional valence (Experiment 1: N = 329; preregistered replication in Experiment 2: N = 524). Using hierarchical Bayesian computational modelling of emotion self-reports, we found that greater affective reactivity to gains and losses within the task was associated with more severe symptoms of both anxiety and hypomania. This suggest that heightened reactivity to both appetitive and aversive outcomes indexes emotional disorder severity across multiple symptom domains of psychopathology, in line with theoretical frameworks that conceptualize affective disturbance as a generalized risk factor for psychopathology.",

          "authors": "Ruth Dassonneville; Bjarn Eck; Bram Wauters",
          "abstract": "When compulsory voting is abolished, this generally leads to a substantial drop in voter turnout. Can measures to increase turnout by local government administrations combat such decline?  In this research note, we take up this question by focusing on the 2024 Flemish local elections, which were the first elections held under voluntary voting after more than 125 years of compulsory voting in the region. We first analyze aggregate level data to study whether municipalities who took more initiatives to mobilize voters witnessed lower levels of turnout decline than municipalities with weaker information campaigns. Second, we employ individual-level post-election survey data to assess whether respondents who were reached by these campaigns were more likely to cast a ballot in the election. The analyses yield a consistent pattern of null results: we find no significant effects on turnout at the aggregate nor at the individual level. We conclude that abolishing compulsory voting leads to a substantial decline in voter turnout that cannot be compensated by targeted measures and campaigns to mobilize citizens to vote.",

          "abstract": "The study examines two dimensions of inequality acceptance in Sweden: income differences and welfare chauvinism, as well as their association with populist attitudes. Based on original survey data collected from 2019 to 2022 (three pooled cross-sections, random samples of the adult population), the study reveals substantial social (by class) and political (by partisanship) divides regarding how redistributive ambitious and socially inclusive the welfare state should be, challenging assumptions of strong sociopolitical consensus. Welfare chauvinism is found to be more politically divisive than approval of income differences, with the sharpest divides emerging in the exclusivist conceptions of social rights and welfare deservingness held by voters of the non-mainstream (radical) right party, the Sweden Democrats. The results suggest that conflicts over inclusivist versus exclusivist conceptions of social rights and welfare deservingness could become central in Swedish politics, potentially shifting away from the universalist principles that underpin its social democratic welfare state model.",

While AI technologies enhance journalistic workflows by automating and augmenting content creation, they also introduce opacity in professional decisions, complicating traditional transparency norms and its disclosure practices. The paper maps citizens’ perceptions regarding disclosures of AI use in journalism, addressing two key themes: (1) the practical information needs of news consumers about AI-generated content and (2) the specific rationales when exposed to (disclosures of) AI generated news content. Through qualitative focus groups (N=21), the exploratory research reveals a strong demand for clear, visible, and detailed disclosures about AI-generated content. Participants emphasized the necessity of including general source references akin to traditional authorship attributions, explicitly stating AI involvement - for example, a label such as ‘generated by AI’ alongside author and publication details. Visual indicators like logos or watermarks in contrasting colors were preferred to ensure AI disclosures are noticeable and not easily overlooked. This study contributes to developing more granular audience-centered, practical guidelines for AI transparency in journalism that goes beyond the mere ‘label’, emphasizing that effective disclosure requires more than simply ‘informing’ audiences.",

          "abstract": "While the association between apprenticeship dropout and negative labor market consequences is well documented, the causal link and social stratification in this effect are less clear. Using geo-referenced administrative data from Germany and a conditional instrumental variable approach that exploits distance between place of residence and large firms, we find negative financial consequences but show that the dropout penalty is entirely concentrated among individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. We further show that these stratified scars partly reflect unequal educational re-enrollment rates and unequal employment outcomes among dropouts who do not re-enroll. Our results highlight the potential of policies targeting higher graduation rates to reduce social inequality in labor markets. Furthermore, our study suggests that social advantage serves as an important buffer against the negative financial consequences of apprenticeship dropout, even in institutional settings with strong links between credentials and labor market outcomes.",

This study demonstrates how modest design changes could enable causal inference on schooling effects. Applying the Differential Exposure Approach (DEA) to TIMSS 2011–2023, we exploit within-country variation in test timing to estimate the causal contribution of schooling to achievement and inequality. Results reveal a global “schooling effect”: each additional month of exposure increases mathematics achievement and narrows socioeconomic gaps. However, limited variation in test windows reduces precision in country-specific estimates, suggesting that broader, randomized testing schedules would strengthen future ILSAs’ capacity to identify and compare schooling effects across countries.",

          "abstract": "Heightened geopolitical tensions, extreme weather conditions, and an increased risk of hybrid attacks have brought renewed attention to crisis preparedness as a key political and research priority across Europe. However, much of the current discourse focuses on individual and household-level measures and overlooks the broader social dimensions of crisis resilience, which are more frequently examined in the aftermath of crises. Given the crucial role of social capital and informal civil society networks in crisis response and recovery, there is a pressing need for greater sociological engagement with the crisis preparedness phase as well. Incorporating literatures of sociology of disasters, civil society studies, crisis management, and disaster risk management, this paper develops an extended sociological framework that conceptualizes crisis preparedness as an inherently social process taking place at the early onset of a crisis. In outlining such a framework, it expands the conceptualization of crisis preparedness beyond individual and material measures to include social infrastructures, such as social capital and the mobilization of civil society. In doing so, the paper contributes to the sociological theory of crisis resilience by conceptualizing crisis preparedness as prospective collective action, thereby reframing sociological understandings of crisis preparedness as risk governance.",

          "abstract": "Political polarization, particularly in its affective form, increasingly shapes how individuals perceive, interact, and collaborate in organizations. This essay argues that partisan prejudice—a growing affective divide between supporters of opposing parties—has become an underexamined but consequential force in workplace communication. We outline an empirical roadmap for advancing research at this intersection. First, we call for descriptive work documenting how polarization manifests in organizations, including inequalities in political expression and the emergence of partisan signaling in daily interactions. Second, we highlight the need to examine how polarization influences workplace communication, from dyadic exchanges to organizational networks, using diverse methodological approaches such as surveys, experiments, and computational analyses. Finally, we encourage research that reverses the causal arrow by investigating how workplace communication might mitigate or exacerbate polarization, considering factors such as leadership communication, virtual collaboration, and diversity initiatives. By integrating theories of polarization and organizational communication, this framework aims to guide systematic inquiry into how political divisions are reproduced—or potentially repaired—through the communicative fabric of work.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how rising income inequality has been impacting individuals' belief in merit-based success, using three decades of survey data from 39 advanced capitalist democracies. Challenging the seminal finding of a \"paradox of inequality,\" we find no evidence of a positive effect of inequality on meritocratic beliefs across countries. Instead, we identify a substantively moderate but robustly negative effect of inequality on perceptions of meritocracy from within-country changes over time: as inequality rises, citizens’ belief in meritocracy declines. We further uncover that inequality does not merely induce a mean shift, but affects the shape of the distribution of meritocracy beliefs insofar as we find the proportion of sceptical perceptions of meritocratic realities to be increasing with higher levels of inequality. Our findings thus suggest that growing inequality undermines citizens’ trust in procedural fairness and contributes to an increased polarisation of attitudes and beliefs at the heart of open societies.",

It argues that AI systems are not neutral tools but socio-technical artifacts embedded in power relations that influence knowledge, pedagogical practices, and structures of legitimacy.\nThe analysis highlights three dimensions through which inequality is reproduced: digital divides that go beyond access and include skills and algorithmic literacy; structural and cultural biases embedded in AI processes such as admission, assessment, and adaptive learning; and algorithmic governmentality, which governs education through surveillance, metrics, and automated feedback, producing new forms of subjectivity oriented toward efficiency rather than critical thinking.\nThe article concludes that AI in education is an ethical and political challenge. It calls for inclusive and contextualized platform design, critical training for teachers, participatory co-design of evaluation systems, and governance mechanisms that ensure transparency and accountability. From the sociology of education, promoting digital environments that are democratic, inclusive, and emancipatory is essential to achieve educational justice in the age of AI.",

Drawing on event data and news reports covering the 2020 racial justice protests and comparing to historical U.S. protest data, we examine the central claims of this framing contest. We find that this wave of racial justice protests was more peaceful than Civil Rights protests of the 1960’s and that Antifa was present at only a handful of events which turned violent. We also find that media attention to Antifa corresponded with declining support for BLM, suggesting that scapegoating Antifa led to a decline in support of the movement.",

To identify this effect, I exploit the deaths of elderly co-residents which occur during the study period in an empirical strategy which relies on triple-differences with child fixed-effects. I show that an event of elderly death is associated with 23% additional education completed over a period of 4 years by affected girls. I present evidence that changes in demand for informal caregiving among older female children within the household are one of the mechanisms at play. These results highlight the importance of female teenagers in caregiving activities and suggest that policies that increase the availability of formal care for the elderly could reduce gender inequalities in education in contexts similar to Senegal.",

Support Vector Machine regression analysis shows that eco-friendliness ratings are explained almost entirely by overall guest satisfaction, with sustainability indicators contributing little explanatory power. This suggests that ratings conflate general service impressions with perceptions of environmental responsibility, limiting their value as measures of sustainability performance. While plausible explanations such as response biases and the limited salience of many certified practices warrant further research, our findings provide robust evidence that single survey items on eco-friendliness should be interpreted with caution. For platforms and policymakers, the results highlight the need to make sustainability cues more visible and directly tied to the consumer experience if ratings are to support informed choice.",

          "authors": "Daniel Martinez-Felip; Steven G.M. Schilizzi; Chi Nguyen; David Pannell",
          "abstract": "In analysing potential policy responses to improve outcomes in collective-action problems, economists often focus on financial disincentives to reduce the expected gains from free-riding and thereby promote within-group cooperation. In this study, we investigate the potential for groups to develop non-financial disincentives to free riding, thereby promoting convergence towards collectively beneficial actions. Using a within-subjects laboratory experiment, participants play two multi-period public-goods games sequentially: without and then with non-financial incentives activated by allowing for the endogenous formation of a social exclusion mechanism. This is operationalised by allowing participants, at a personal cost, to assign exclusion tickets to group members after observing their contributions: the member(s) having accumulated the most in their group gets excluded from a group activity not involving monetary payoffs nor linked to the main game. First, the threat of receiving exclusion tickets, then the threat of being excluded, and finally actually being excluded work as non-financial social disincentives to free ride. Results show that group members who contribute relatively less receive more exclusion tickets. By imposing expected social costs on relatively low contributors, exclusion or the threat of exclusion enables groups to operate with higher contribution levels, thereby reversing the collective decline in contributions observed in the Baseline public good game. Exclusion is experienced by individuals who consistently contribute less than other group members, and this experience amplifies the effectiveness of the subsequent exclusion threat. Willingness to incur personal costs to enhance the exclusion threat increases over time and it is shaped by more cooperative normative expectations. This effect is particularly pronounced among individuals who perceive norms as tight, especially when higher contributions become more dispersed. In the absence of financial disincentives, these patterns show how non-financial incentives, shaped by more cooperative normative expectations, can foster group coordination and higher public-good contributions.",

          "abstract": "Firms increasingly drive college graduates' labor market earnings, yet the vast literature on the value-added of college has largely overlooked their role. Drawing on human capital theory and institutional theories of credentialism, closure, and organizational matching, I argue that college-to-workplace pipelines are a critical driver of college value-added. To test this, I assemble a novel US employer-employee matched dataset merged with postsecondary and high school academic records. Firm placement explains much of the variation in earnings premiums between colleges. Absent firm sorting, the range of counterfactual earnings differences across colleges would fall by 56%, and over half of the earnings advantage to attending the state flagship comes from access to higher-paying employers. These sorting effects extend broadly across the distribution of high-wage firms, and not merely a handful of elite employers. Crucially, sorting effects do not simply reflect skill-based advantages, implying that college quality derives as much from institutional linkages to the labor market as from human capital development. Policies aimed at broadening recruitment pipelines, rather than solely improving instructional inputs, are therefore essential to reducing inequalities in the economic returns to higher education.",

          "abstract": "Organization redesign often raises a central question: Where are managers needed? A potential substitute for formal supervision by managers is interpersonal cultural alignment, which can ease coordination between colleagues. Yet prior research suggests cultural alignment may also complement formal structure. We theorize that the balance depends on coordinative complexity: Whether culturally aligned individuals benefit from common supervision hinges on how broadly they depend on others to get work done. Cultural alignment substitutes for formal structure when coordinative complexity is low and complements it when coordinative complexity is high. Focusing on one of the most tangible and consequential forms of cultural alignment---the degree to which individuals are linguistically aligned with their peers in everyday communications---we make predictions about which pairs of colleagues will be brought together under, versus pulled apart from, a shared supervisor. Using archival data from a design firm, we find support for our theory, with effects especially strong when colleagues are highly visible to their senior managers.",

          "authors": "Sehyun Hong; Nak Nyeon Kim; Zhexun Mo; Li Yang; Carolyn Fisher",
          "abstract": "We combine household survey micro data, tax data, and national accounts to construct annual pretax income inequality series for South Korea, which is coherent with macro aggregates. We provide the distribution of pretax national income over the time period from 1933 to 2022, with detailed breakdown by income composition in the years from 1996 to 2022. Our new series demonstrates that Korean top income shares decreased substantially from the 1930s up until the mid-1960s, following various wars, independence and land reform policies. Income inequalities then stabilized against the backdrop of rapid economic growth in the 1970s and 1980s, and decreased even further from the late 1980s onwards until the onset of the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, which contradicts the “Kuznets Curve.” In the aftermath of the crisis, income inequality worsened due to the rise of tax-exempted capital income concentration at the top. Compared to other East Asian countries, South Korea exhibits relatively lower levels of income inequality in terms of higher bottom 50% income shares, mostly due to a more equal distribution of national income growth at the stages of economic take-off in the 1980s, even though income concentration at the very top has strikingly worsened over the last two decades, with its top 1% income shares in 2022 returning back to the peak only observed during the colonial era.

It replicates and expands the 1992 econometric study of the textbook Solow growth model by Mankiw, Romer, and Weil to recent years. Using cross- sectional data, the paper analyzes the impact of saving and population growth, technology and capital depreciation rates on the economic growth of a country. It shows that, in line with the textbook Solow model, higher saving positively affects economic growth, while the population growth rate affects it negatively. However, the paper demonstrates higher values of the OLS estimators of these factors than predicted by the Solow model, which suggests that augmentation of the model is necessary for it to be more successful in explaining the variation in international standards of living.",

          "authors": "Brittany Tarufelli; James Gibson; Sarah Barrows; Abhishek Somani; Daniel Boff",
          "abstract": "Energy storage plays a crucial role in modern power systems, providing services such as grid stability, frequency regulation, and load balancing. Currently, storage systems earn revenue by offering these grid services and through energy arbitrage—buying electricity when prices are low and selling when prices are high. However, as storage deployment expands, arbitrage profitability declines due to market saturation and narrowing price differentials (Sioshansi et al., 2009; Li et al., 2024). In ERCOT, for example, 2024 saw reduced arbitrage potential due to moderate weather and increased storage capacity. This trend underscores the need for new business models that more fully recognize and compensate the value energy storage provides to the power system.\n\nThis paper presents empirical research on the full value of energy storage and proposes a commodity-market-based framework to better align compensation mechanisms with system-wide benefits. We examine hydropower as a proxy for grid-scale storage, using exogenous variation in reservoir storage volume to estimate causal effects on (1) real-time electricity prices and (2) risk premiums, measured by the day-ahead to real-time price spread, in the Northwestern United States between May 2022 and November 2024. Employing fixed-effects and lagged dependent variable models, we control for unobserved heterogeneity across balancing authorities and capture dynamic price behavior.\n\nWe find that a 10% increase in reservoir storage volume reduces real-time prices by approximately 6% and lowers risk premiums by about 5%, indicating that storage mitigates short-term supply–demand imbalances. These effects are most pronounced during grid stress events, such as cold snaps, suggesting that stored energy provides significant value when the system is under strain. The results are robust to dynamic pricing effects and highlight storage’s role in reducing both price volatility and systemic risk.\n\nOverall, stored energy substantially reduces system costs and alleviates grid stress, yet most electricity markets lack mechanisms that compensate storage for these benefits. As revenue from arbitrage and grid services diminishes with increased deployment, alternative business models are needed to reward storage for its intrinsic function—potentially through the creation of a stand-alone commodity, such as stored energy itself (see the winter reserve mechanism in Switzerland). Our findings provide empirical support for developing future market frameworks that more accurately capture the risk-reducing and reliability-enhancing contributions of grid-scale energy storage.",

Based on qualitative interviews with 12 staff from five INGOs, findings reaffirm critiques of Education in Emergencies’ short-term approach, highlighting its emphasis on provision over impact.

          "abstract": "Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea marked the onset of a systematic repression campaign against the Crimean Tatar population. We introduce CriTaRep v1.0, the first comprehensive, geo-coded event dataset documenting state repression against Crimean Tatars (2014-2024). Drawing on locally sourced materials in Crimean Tatar, Ukrainian, and Russian languages, CriTaRep records n = 690 repression events affecting more than 2,200 individual victims. We inductively identify 22 repression types across three categories: deprivation of liberty, legal and administrative repression, and physical repression. Our data shows a strategic yet adaptive campaign, including a systematic concentration of arbitrary searches on Thursdays, initial physical repression targeting primarily elites, and intensified repression during periods of dissent. Integrating additional disaggregated variables and employing fixed-effects Poisson models, we find that the short-term frequency of repression is significantly driven by protest activity, rather than sanction levels or cultural focal events. Russian authorities respond rapidly and increasingly harshly to dissent, pursuing a dual strategy of immediate protest suppression and long-term deterrence. CriTaRep fills critical gaps in existing datasets and provides new opportunities to study patterns and mechanisms of demographically targeted repression.",

          "abstract": "This proof-of-concept study introduces the Social Morphology Ball, a framework for visualizing multivariate social data as three-dimensional morphological structures. The method normalizes variables using the median and interquartile range (IQR), followed by nonlinear compression with a hyperbolic tangent function to reduce the impact of extreme outliers. Each normalized variable is mapped onto spherical basis functions, transforming numerical relationships into geometric deformations—bulges or concavities—on a sphere. When all variables align with their long-term medians, the model yields a perfect sphere representing a morphologically neutral, structurally balanced state. Implemented in Python, the pipeline automates normalization, shape generation, and visualization, exporting results in STL, PNG, and GIF formats. Applied to Japanese national statistics from 2015–2023, the model captured temporal variations in the balance and distortion of societal indicators through intuitive 3D forms. By interpreting data as morphology rather than numbers, this approach extends social data visualization into a sensory and cognitive domain, providing a conceptual foundation for morphological visualization of social phenomena and potential applications in education, policy, and data-driven art.",

          "abstract": "A new software platform is presented in this article to oversee and manage urban and industrial smart systems by employing digital twin technologies and immersive, interactive metaverse settings, thereby achieving environmentally sustainable urban infrastructure. The system proposed is prepared to track, simulate, and optimize building performance using predictive analytics and interactive dashboards, and thus serves as a modular, interoperable solution. By defining a multi-residential site management case study, a working prototype is developed and implemented here using simulated and realistic datasets, thereby designed for real-time calculation and visualization of key performance indicators (KPIs) across various areas, including energy efficiency, preventive maintenance, user experience through design, and economic performance. The choice of KPIs, such as energy usage intensity, return on investment, and user satisfaction, can benefit from this technology setup and yield improvements through enhanced operational efficiency, clearer decision-making, and long-term cost-effectiveness. Although such obstacles exist, empirical testing with real data may reveal that integration with hardware, interoperability with existing setups, and economic costing are feasible for small to medium-sized players. With evaluation performed using simulated data, the platform suggests a prospective setup ready to be tested through pilot testing with real-world deployment. In situating the Smart Infrastructure Metaverse here, as a transformation setup of digital governance within a built and developed framework with technological innovation coupled with sustainability and with inclusivity to all the players/stakeholders, the cities embarked here through ever-increasing digital ecosystems with advantages of having such works through an emerging discussion of how immersive technology informs here of a next-generation potential of smart, sustainable, and participatory urban living.",

However, their structure and functioning remain highly heterogeneous across Europe. This study aimed to develop consensus-based policy recommendations to support their harmonized implementation. \nMethods:\nA two-round Delphi process was conducted among 17 European experts actively involved in MTBs. Questionnaire items were derived from a systematic and scoping review on the clinical impact and implementation aspects of MTBs. Experts rated items on a five-point Likert scale, with consensus predefined as a Content Validity Index (CVI) ≥ 80% of experts agreeing or strongly agreeing (scores 4-5).\nResults:\nAcross two Delphi rounds, 76 items were evaluated. Thirty-six achieved consensus and were consolidated into 15 recommendations across four domains: organizational aspects (n = 8), testing (n = 3), inclusion criteria (n = 2), and clinical aspects (n = 2). Organizational standards emphasized the appointment of a referent clinician, the use of standardized digital submission tools, online meeting formats, and the integration of decision-support systems. The recommended MTB composition was multidisciplinary, including oncologists, molecular biologists, pathologists, geneticists, and other relevant specialists. In the testing domain, experts agreed that NGS should be the preferred approach for molecular profiling, conducted in certified laboratories, with variant interpretation supported by curated databases (e.g., ClinVar, COSMIC, OncoKB). Inclusion criteria prioritized patients with metastatic or rare diseases, ECOG performance status 0–2, life expectancy ≥12 weeks, and exhaustion of standard therapeutic options.\nConclusions:\nThis Delphi consensus produced 15 policy recommendations to standardize and sustain MTBs across Europe. These guidelines complement existing frameworks by providing practical operational guidance for precision oncology implementation.",

The institutions that once formed citizens and carried meaning, responsibility, and authorship of a common life still function – schools, universities, workplaces, congregations, hospitals, etc. Yet they no longer enable people to govern together and see themselves reflected in the world in any meaningful sense. Civic energy persists, but it leaks through frameworks that can no longer turn that energy into durable public life. The result is not only distrust in government but a deeper collapse of civic faith.\n\nThis paper advances civic architecture as a framework for understanding and repairing the exhaustion – the structural civic breakdown of American institutions. The paper argues that democracy depends not simply on participation but on design: the deliberate construction of institutions that embed authorship, distribute power, and sustain civic responsibility across generations.\n\nDeveloped conceptually through democratic theory, civic studies, and the Black intellectual tradition, the framework is illustrated through an institutional example at Huston–Tillotson University (HT), a Historically Black University (HBCU) in Austin, Texas. There, the Politics Lab of the James L. Farmer House (Farmer House) demonstrates how students and educators can translate frustration into durable authorship, showing what it means to design for democracy within existing institutional life.\n\nDemocracy cannot survive on energy alone.

          "abstract": "While a significant body of scholarly work exists to diagnose the probability of systemic socio-political crises, less attention has been paid to the consequential problem of prognosis: forecasting the character of the regime that emerges from the collapse. This paper addresses this critical gap by proposing a falsifiable theoretical framework for forecasting the post-collapse morphology of political systems. It integrates insights from the structural history of the Annales School, the heuristic use of concepts from depth psychology, and findings from evolutionary psychology to posit that a society operates on three interconnected levels: a rapidly changing socio-cultural \"Operating System\"; a deeper, intermediate layer of universal symbolic patterns, or archetypal \"BIOS\"; and a foundational \"Hardware\" of immutable biological instincts. The framework’s first stage provides a robust diagnosis of systemic instability by measuring the relationship between stress and resilience within the surface \"Operating System.\" The second, and more innovative stage, introduces the Archetypal Activation Index (AAI), a heuristic tool designed to forecast the ideological and psychological DNA of the successor state by analyzing the activation of deep symbolic patterns during a systemic \"reboot.\" The purpose of this paper is thus methodological: to propose a structured framework that shifts the focus from diagnosis to prognosis. Through a detailed examination of the Roman Republic, the English Civil War, and the Weimar Republic, we illustrate how this two-stage analysis can deconstruct the anatomy of historical chaos and provide a more structured understanding of the political forms that emerge from it.",

We find that, on average, nano-targeting does not perform better than an overall \"best message'', but that nano-targeted messages were more persuasive than the best message for individuals who were already supportive of climate action. We also discover backlash effects from \"mis-targeting'', and find an important asymmetry: being randomly assigned messages predicted to be far from one's best policy has stronger dissuasive effects than the persuasive effects of being shown one's best message. Together these results suggest that these technologies may not be practical for most actors, but may be effective for entrepreneurs who aim to dissuade, demobilize or polarize.",

A qualitative methodology is used, and four Bangla-background students enrolled in different English-medium institutions in Dhaka are interviewed using a semi-structured format. Brief narrations provide information about language use, classroom participation and learning strategies. Thematic analysis identifies common difficulties and coping styles. Findings show that while most students can acquire functional English knowledge, they often struggle with confidence, self-expression, and cultural connection in class. Memorization is widely used due to language gaps; students tend to memorize lessons rather than fully understand them. Peer and teacher support plays an important role in academic achievement. The study highlights the sociolinguistic reality of Bangla-background students in English-medium settings, which is more complex than often assumed. The research suggests the need for more inclusive teaching approaches and policies that consider cultural and linguistic diversity and promote open and supportive language learning environments.",

          "authors": "Medinah Suleiman",
          "abstract": "Population ageing in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is occurring rapidly amid persistent socioeconomic inequities, yet little is known about how disadvantages accumulate across the life course to shape older adults’ wellbeing. Drawing on a scoping review methodology guided by Arksey and O’Malley (2005) and enhancements by Levac et al. (2010), this review synthesizes evidence from empirical, theoretical, and policy literature published between 1990 and mid-2025 to map how cumulative social and economic disadvantage unfolds across life stages and affects later life outcomes in SSA. Sixty-odd studies from 18 countries were included, spanning quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods designs. The review reveals that early life adversity such as low childhood socioeconomic status, limited education, and health shocks sets trajectories that constrain opportunities for formal employment, asset accumulation, and social mobility. These constraints are compounded over adulthood, especially among women and rural populations who disproportionately engage in informal work, caregiving, and face structural exclusions such as lack of pension coverage. The accumulation of disadvantage across life stages is consistently associated with poorer physical and mental health, reduced financial security, social isolation, and heightened vulnerability in old age. While a minority of studies explicitly frame their analyses in life course or cumulative disadvantage theory, many implicitly invoke life trajectory thinking. Longitudinal data remain scarce, and intersectional, contextually grounded, and comparative research is limited. The review underscores the need to adapt cumulative disadvantage models to the African context, accounting for macro-historical shocks, informal economies, kin networks, and nonmaterial assets, and to invest in life course–oriented policies. Interventions aimed at early childhood, education, inclusive social protection, gender equity, and integrated ageing frameworks are vital to interrupt compounding disadvantage and promote equitable ageing in SSA.",

This paper examines how shifts in the racial and ethnic composition of city councils influence land use and housing development, particularly in relation to decision-making diversity. Using data on city council elections and the distribution of new housing permits, I identify the causal effect of electing a minority representative on housing supply. The findings reveal that minority representation increases single-family housing construction at the expense of multi-family housing, challenging conventional expectations about ideology and race. Qualitative interviews with city council members suggest that efforts to address minority underrepresentation drive active support for single-family housing, while distrust of developers—rooted in fears of gentrification—fuels skepticism toward multi-family projects. Overall, the study presents a nuanced view of racial representation: while minorities achieve better representational outcomes, these gains can come with costs.",

We argue that this variation can be explained by differences in the historical industrialization process. Communities that industrialized later and more intensively realign more toward the radical right today. This is because the built environment shaped by the original industrialization drives demographic persistence and neighborhood disadvantage. To examine our argument, we study the effects of nineteenth-century coal mining in Germany's Ruhr area. We match the geolocation of over 1,000 mining shafts, historical plant-level employment data, and the spread of company housing with contemporary electoral results at the neighborhood level. For identification, we exploit the depth of coal deposits that governed the adoption of deep-shaft mining. The findings demonstrate how the path of economic development influences voting in the long run.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: People with disabilities are underemployed. This improved recently, but how broadly across disability type? US law allows employers to pay people with disabilities far below minimum wage, typically in segregated settings (sheltered workshops), if employers hold federal 14(c) certificates. Almost everyone in 14(c) employment has an intellectual/developmental disability. Some states have eliminated sheltered workshops, and the Biden administration may propose phasing them out. This is controversial.\nOBJECTIVE: To examine employment patterns pre- and post-pandemic among people with disabilities and patterns in use of sheltered workshops.\nMETHOD: We analyzed American Community Survey data on employment rate, by type of disability (or lack of disability), for 2010-2023, Department of Labor data on 14(c) subminimum wage certificates in Community Rehabilitation Programs for 2010-2024, and Department of Labor data on number of workers paid subminimum wages in such programs for 2015-2024.\nRESULTS: American Community Survey data show the disability employment gap narrowing post-pandemic for every disability category—but narrowing especially dramatically for people with cognitive disabilities. Long-term, the employment gap for people with cognitive disabilities narrowed in every state while Department of Labor data show 14(c) enrollment decreasing in every state.\nCONCLUSION: Research to inform public policy and hiring and retention practices should take advantage of the post-pandemic improvement in the employment gap for people with disabilities, especially cognitive disabilities, and marketing investments should promote them.",

          "abstract": "This study reconsiders a classic sociological question: how does space shape intimate ties? Specifically, it examines how the spatial segregation of ethnic groups contributes to patterns of ethnic endogamy. It does so by applying conditional logit models to Swedish population registers describing couples who began cohabiting between 1990 and 2017. The models compare observed unions to counterfactual unions drawn from available singles, distinguishing the effects of ancestry assortativity---based on country of origin---from residential propinquity, while controlling for matching on nativity, education, and age. Proximity strongly predicts partnering, but assortativity matters too, particularly for non-Western groups. Mediation analysis shows that failing to account for propinquity overstates endogamy by 20–40 percent for these groups, with stronger mediation for the most segregated groups. The findings suggest that segregation complements ethnic boundaries in the short term, but also suggest how integration may undermine group boundaries in the longer term.",

This study aims to systematically synthesize and analyze empirical evidence regarding the performance of BAZNAS across three key dimensions: efficiency, effectiveness, and governance, amidst the rapid wave of digitalization. This research employs the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method, following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) protocol. Through a search process across the Scopus, Google Scholar, and SINTA databases, 40 relevant journal articles published between 2015-2025 were identified and analyzed in-depth. The synthesis results show a consensus that BAZNAS is effective in its poverty alleviation programs (as measured by the CIBEST Model and NZI) but faces challenges in operational efficiency (identified via DEA/SFA studies) and uneven implementation of governance. A research gap was found, namely the lack of studies integrating these three performance dimensions to explain their reciprocal relationships. As its main contribution, this study proposes an integrated conceptual framework that positions governance (GCG) as a fundamental independent variable influencing operational efficiency and program effectiveness, with digital technology adoption acting as a moderating variable. This framework can serve as a reference for future empirical research.\nKeywords: BAZNAS, Systematic Literature Review, Efficiency, Effectiveness, Zakat Governance, Conceptual Framework, PRISMA.",

          "abstract": "Recent debates on ‘democratic deconsolidation’ raise three key questions: are younger people less supportive of democracy; where is this occurring; and is the trend worsening? This paper addresses these questions by comparing African and European democracies using five rounds of the Integrated Values Survey and nine rounds of the Afrobarometer. We apply age-period-cohort-interaction models to assess generational support for democracy and openness to authoritarian alternatives; we also differentiate democratic trajectories across regions. In Africa, the dominant pattern is a general downward trend in democratic support and rejection of authoritarianism, in some cases led by younger cohorts. In Europe, although cohort effects continue to reflect declines in democratic support that were concentrated among younger age groups in the past, support for democracy subsequently recovered among more recent cohorts.  However, some European electoral democracies show a rise in openness to authoritarianism, especially among young cohorts.",

Mainstream climate governance often casts adaptation as a technical\nadjustment to biophysical hazards, but such framings risk naturalizing inequality by obscuring\nthe longue-durée histories of extraction and dispossession that have structured vulnerability.\nDrawing on multi-sited ethnographic research in coastal, agrarian, and urban communities in\nSierra Leone, this paper introduces the concept of counteradaptation to illustrate how people\nnavigate not only environmental volatility but also the antagonistic pressures generated by\n(neo)colonial systems. Counteradaptation highlights how adaptive moves in one domain—\nwhether foreign extraction, ‘development’ apparatuses, or climate policy regimes—create new\npressures that compel situated responses elsewhere. Case studies of fishing communities, timber\nand gold frontiers, and informal urban settlements show how counteradaptation reframes\nhabitability as a contested threshold and exposes the limits of technocratic adaptation toolkits. By\nsituating climate response within histories of coloniality and predatory accumulation,\ncounteradaptation offers a novel analytic for understanding ‘environmental’ behavior.",

          "authors": "Abel Aussant",
          "abstract": "Over the last decade, states throughout Europe have begun implementing universal culture vouchers for young adults to boost cultural participation. Little is known about the effects of these large-scale subsidies, specifically whether they are truly an effective means of widening participation. This article addresses this question by evaluating the French ‘pass Culture’, a €300 stipend for cultural consumption offered to all 18-year-olds. Drawing from the fields of the sociology of culture and cultural economics, this study aims to determine whether an increase in purchasing power for cultural goods can influence participation. The empirical analysis is based on an econometric examination of a large-scale survey examining cultural participation and the use of ‘pass Culture’. The results reveal that while the voucher does not affect participation in institutional highbrow cultural activities like museum visits, theater, or opera attendance, it significantly increases engagement with commercial popular culture, including cinema and comic book reading. These findings suggest that financial barriers are not the primary obstacle to consumption in cultural capital-intensive activities. However, financial constraints do appear to contribute to non-participation in popular cultural life among certain youth demographics. The article then discusses the theoretical implications of these findings for our understanding of the relationship between cultural consumption, cultural policies, and social inequalities.",

          "authors": "William Fernandez",
          "abstract": "In the developed world, efforts are underway to extend working lives. However, discussions often overlook the potential implications of  retirement for individual well-being. While the relationship between retirement and life satisfaction has been extensively studied, the effects of spousal retirement remain underexplored, particularly from a gender and timing perspective. This paper examines the impact of retirement on self-reported life satisfaction among couples in Germany. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), I employ standard fixed-effects (FE) models and fixed-effects individual slopes (FEIS) to estimate the causal effects of personal and partner retirement on life satisfaction. The findings show that retirement substantially increases life satisfaction, a result that remains robust across methodologies and specifications. For partner retire￾ment, accounting for heterogeneous trends by health status reveals an overall positive effect, driven by men. Moreover, women appear to be worse off when their husbands retire while they remain in the workforce, whereas the opposite holds for men. To my knowledge, this is the first study to examine the impact of both personal and spousal retirement on life satisfaction using the SOEP. The results provide robust evidence that partner retirement affects life satisfaction, highlighting the importance of understanding retirement as a life course event with intra-household spillover effects that extend beyond the retiring individual.",

Women’s financial security is particularly jeopardized in conservative welfare states that limit women’s options to accrue independent pension entitlements. This study examines women’s work–family life courses and financial security in later life in two conservative welfare states with distinct pension policies: West Germany with a Bismarckian pension system and the Netherlands with a more universalistic pension system. Drawing on SHARELIFE data, we apply multichannel sequence and cluster analysis, and regression methods to link work-family life course typologies to individual pensions, survivor benefits, and household equivalence income. Findings show that the work-family life courses in the two countries strongly resembled each other, characterized by a strong care orientation and weak labour force attachment of married mothers. However, women with care-oriented life courses receive substantially higher individual pensions in the Netherlands, which grant Dutch women higher financial autonomy. In contrast, women’s survivor benefits and household income were slightly higher in West Germany, affording a higher living standard but less financial autonomy, and a higher risk of poverty following a potential separation compared to the Netherlands.",

Here we synthesise international research from the history of nature markets and summarise five rules which are necessary precursors for achieving their environmental aims. We propose a checklist for investors, policymakers, and civil society to assess whether nature markets are likely to be delivering scientifically-credible outcomes. We score the world’s largest nature markets against these rules and show all face integrity risks.

Hacking is a creative research method and mode of critical play that involves participants unmaking and remaking games by doing things like changing the game rules, creating new components, making new pieces for the game, or new art, and combining the different elements of the game in new ways. This experience was messier than we had envisaged when designing and pitching the project for our funders, Game in Lab and the Libellud Foundation, who are industry-based funding bodies promoting the scientific study of games. The semi-contained chaos in the room punctured the confidence of our written research proposal, which naïvely described a neatly complementary interaction of games and young researchers. This chapter is a reflection on what we learned as researchers, and an examination of the relationships that unfolded between research, game hacking and activism.",

Prevailing theories suggest that governments must either repress dissent, concede through meaningful policy reversals, or ignore unrest and risk backlash. This paper introduces the concept of temporary concessions: short-term, strategic policy reversals later re-implemented to demobilize protest while maintaining reform and regime stability. I argue that regimes deploy temporary concessions when repression is costly or externally constrained, and ignoring protest risks escalation. By disrupting protest momentum and introducing a collective action problem among protesters, tem porary concessions make demobilization the individually rational choice. Evidence from subsidy reforms in Jordan and Egypt, combined with a nationally representative survey experiment, shows that these tactics defuse unrest even when citizens doubt their durability, challenging prevailing models of authoritarian responsiveness and resilience under economic liberalization.",

          "abstract": "Climate change and the depletion of the Earths natural resources are among the largest challenges humanity currently faces. In light of this, the planned German Longitudinal Environmental Study (GLEN) aims at investigating the incentives, restrictions, attitudes, and beliefs that underlie human-environment interactions. In doing so, the GLEN project aims to provide a foundation for evidence-based environmental policy assessments and guidance. The project will build up a large-scale panel study of the adult population in Germany in which the same individuals will be repeatedly observed over time using a standardized and stable online survey instrument. Due to its longitudinal design and the linkage of the collected survey data to geospatial information on respondents social and ecological environments, the panel will be well suited to analyzing natural experiments such as regional policy measures (e.g., price changes, information campaigns) and exposure to local environmental conditions (e.g., extreme weather events). In addition, the panel\nwill be used as a platform for survey experiments to investigate trade-offs in environmental preferences, consumption decisions, and the acceptance of environmental technologies and policies. With this design, GLEN will meet the urgent need for data suitable for causal research and simulations in the environmental social sciences. With occasionally refreshed samples, it will also allow for the monitoring of trends in environmental concern and behavior, focusing on diverse social, political, economic, and psychological aspects. Accordingly, GLEN is primarily understood as a data infrastructure for environmental research across all social science disciplines. Key questions that can be addressed with the data include: What influences environmental concern, behavior, and the acceptance of technologies and policies to protect the environment? What consequences do environmental policies and changing environments have for social inequalities, and how does that affect (perceived) environmental justice? As a long-term project, GLEN will cover the period between 2024 and 2035, and thus the period in which decisive policy measures to replace fossil fuels are set to be implemented in accordance with international agreements. In sum, the project includes three work streams to pursue three closely related goals: (I) First and foremost, the project will generate a data infrastructure for the environmental social sciences, to be used not only in Germany, but also internationally. (II) The project team will utilize the data for substantive environmental social science research. (III) The project will provide evidence-based policy evaluations and guidance with regular policy reports and embedded experiments. The project team requests funding for the first 3-year period of the planned long-term project.",

These tools are now ubiquitously and instantly accessible, e.g., via smartphones, and the quality of their translations has markedly improved. When used in informal and institutional, spontaneous as well as planned contexts between individuals and groups without a common language or lingua franca, these translation tools create new and unique contexts for interaction that would not otherwise exist. This development has generated a novel genre of research settings essential for exploring intercultural communication, as they foster new forms of interculturality, enabling new experiences, and raise new ethical questions about intercultural interaction. Consequently, AI-translated intercultural communication has emerged as a new basis for the development of interculturality. The current research overview indicates that this phenomenon remains largely unexplored, with significant research questions and areas still unaddressed. Existing studies focus on the technical aspects of machine translation, the feasibility and limitations of achieving human-like, accurate translation, and the future role of human translators. The active role of translation tools in creating novel intercultural contact situations urgently requires further investigation and exploration.",

The framework proposed in this research can become a more comprehensive reference source for future studies in sustainable food consumption topics. In specific, policymakers can use this framework to design effective campaigns/policies to promote sustainable food consumption practices of their residents.

          "abstract": "Background: History of invasion, ongoing colonisation, and systemic racism excluding First Nations Peoples from healthcare are root cause of health inequalities including disparities in foot health outcomes. Sources of inquiry into current practice, learning, and experience which may shape reform of providing good foot care with and for First Nations Peoples in the land now known as Australia are health practitioners working in the space. This work seeks to explore foot care service delivery by investigating First Nations and non-Indigenous health practitioners’ perspectives regarding providing foot care with and for First Nations Peoples. \nMethods: Ways of working are documented in previous work; ‘Working right ways in foot health with and for First Nations Peoples: research method guided and governed by First Nations ways of knowing, being, and doing in cross-sectional qualitative study design’. Four First Nations and six non-Indigenous health practitioners provided perspectives with culturally responsive semi-structured interviews guiding talking with consenting participants. Analytic induction utilised First Nations expertise, inductive reasoning, and constant comparison method in thematic analysis.\nResults: Two talking points engaged health practitioners’ perspectives of providing foot care with and for First Nations Peoples: (1) What does foot health mean to you as a First Nations or non-Indigenous health practitioner? (2) What are needs for providing good foot care with and for First Nations Peoples? Within responses, themes emerged of mobility, overall wellbeing, and advocacy being related to the meaning of foot health. The requirements of Cultural Safety, workforce, and holistic care were perceived as needed for provision of good foot care with and for First Nations Peoples.    \nConclusion: Participants described a meaning of foot health relational to physical and spiritual constructs, and central to reclamation of, and continuation of, First Nations cultures; amidst a project of ongoing colonisation. Needs for good foot care provision with and for First Nations Peoples included a workforce continually learning and unlearning to develop cultural capabilities to work with and for, and support, First Nations foot health. This study provides qualified voiced lived experience of health practitioners working in the space which the podiatry profession must listen to and receive direction and learning from.",

          "abstract": "Research that purports to engage communities has become more mainstream, presenting an imperative to thoughtfully engage ethical principles that grapple with on-the-ground complexities of the work. Here we reflect on learnings from an eight-year, community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership in British Columbia, Canada that addressed the ongoing public health emergency of toxic drug-related deaths in a semi-urban and rural setting. This challenging research context provides a methodological petri dish from which to examine common ethical challenges inherent in CBPR work. Here we discuss how praxis aligned with the concepts of relationality, embeddedness and embodiment contain both tension and promise in complex research contexts. We depict how relational authenticity was facilitated by flexibility and informal interactions and was further enhanced by deeply-engaged, physical presence that enkindled hope even when hope was hampered by limited agency. We also present commensality as a promising methodological tool.",

          "authors": "Issam Rian",
          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate feedback in L2 writing, yet little is known about how such output reshapes learners’ decision-making. This qualitative multiple-case study examines how genre-based ChatGPT feedback and dialogue shape novice L2 writers’ metacognitive judgments (MJs)—their basis, accuracy, and evolution—and how these judgments, in turn, drive self-regulated learning (SRL). In a first-year composition course for international students, nine participants completed three genre-based assignments and engaged in structured, AI feedback cycles using a custom GPT, Genre Guru, designed to provide genre-specific feedback. Data sources included AI-feedback reflections, ChatGPT interaction logs, end-of-course reflections, and five post-semester interviews. Using thematic analysis, MJs were traced across the four domains of genre-specific knowledge (formal, rhetorical, process, subject-matter) and mapped onto the phases of SRL (forethought, performance, self-reflection). Four themes emerged: (1) students moved from initial skepticism to measured trust; (2) learners critically evaluated and selectively adopted AI suggestions, preserving text ownership; (3) writers integrated the four domains and articulated genre awareness; and (4) emotions and motivation drove self-regulatory cycles. Findings suggest that, when framed by genre theory and embedded in reflective dialogue, LLM-mediated feedback can function as a catalyst for AI-calibrated metacognition: enhancing judgment quality, scaffolding regulation, and expediting adaptive, autonomous L2 writing without displacing human intelligence and agency.",

          "abstract": "We study the enforcement of two pillars of colonial rule in French West Africa—military conscription and head tax collection—using new district-level data from 1919 to 1949. Tax compliance was strikingly high, with about 80 percent of liable taxpayers meeting obligations despite limited administrative capacity. Military recruitment targets were likewise consistently met despite avoidance and poor health. Spikes in head tax rates significantly increased tax-related protests, prompting colonial authorities to moderate rates in times of crisis and adjust burdens to perceived district affluence. Yet local shocks such as droughts or crop price collapses were largely ignored. (Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality Working Paper)",

Many IOs assume a trade-off between expertise and representation, where the former increases capacity and the latter increases legitimacy. However, this paper provides evidence that geographic representation can enhance bureaucratic information capacity. Using the European Commission's Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs as a case study, I provide evidence that increasing representation of bureaucrats from a member state increases the accuracy of that state's economic forecasts. This effect, which I call ``national expertise,\" decreases as member state representation within the Commission increases and is most pronounced for large economies. These findings highlight that prioritizing geographic balance in IOs may positively impact both legitimacy and capacity.",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates how participation in a citizens’ assembly affects individuals’ redistributive preferences and (perceived) role in democracy. We implement a pre-registered field experiment embedded in a real-world citizens’ assembly on wealth inequality in Austria. Using a three-group-design comparing assembly participants, non-selected volunteers, and a population sample, we isolate the causal effects of taking part in a citizens’ assembly from self-selection into participation. We find that while participating in the citizens’ assembly substantially improves factual knowledge about the wealth distribution and promotes convergence around specific tax policy proposals, notably a EUR 1 million allowance, it has no measurable effect on political efficacy or broader civic engagement. We also document significant political self-selection: individuals willing to participate in the citizens’ assembly were already more engaged and supportive of redistribution than the general population. These findings suggest that while deliberative formats can foster informed convergence on policy proposals, their ability to mobilize broader publics is limited – especially if they primarily engage the already supportive and, as in this case, lack institutional anchoring that might facilitate spillover into more institutionalized political arenas.

Yet bipartisan-cited science is unevenly distributed—concentrated in monetary policy and healthcare, but notably absent in climate, inequality, and race and gender. These results show that bipartisan engagement, though limited, marks a uniquely influential core of science in both research and policy.",

          "abstract": "Writing in the sciences transcends the notion of sticking to the data. Writing is a complex transformation of a wealth of semi-ordered information into a clear and persuasive scientific story. The formalised form of a research article contains this story and, if published, legitimises it. This empirical study provides a nuanced, empirically-driven appreciation of scientific writing before writer and text are mediated by the competition for and accounting of authorship. It builds on a qualitative study of writing (n=22) and elucidates essential features of writing such as the hermeneutics of the scientific story, different modes of writing as iteration and collaboration, spanning across levels of seniority and position. Furthermore, this study delivers a new perspective on professional scientific writers—trained scientists who provide writing-as-a-service but often remain invisible in attributions of authorship. The structure of this article is as follows. The introduction provides an overview of the literature and elaborates the central research questions (1). We then define our area of research in terms of actors and discuss our research design (2). Thereafter (3), we present and contextualise empirical findings along central themes such as: the writing journey, the division of labour in scientific writing, the meaning of style and storytelling, the relation of writing practices and authorship, and the position of the scientific writer. Finally (4), we conclude, expounding on the intermediatory functions of scientific writing in the broader context of knowledge production, and provide a comprehensive outlook.",

          "abstract": "Editorial boards function as gatekeepers in academic publishing, yet systematic frameworks for quantifying how symbolic capital concentrates within editorial networks remain absent. This study operationalizes Bourdieu’s symbolic capital theory through network analysis of 2,135 editorial positions across 30 sustainability science journals. Eigenvector centrality measures symbolic capital as prestige derived from connections to other prestigious positions, while Gini coefficients assess distributional inequality. Among 71 interlocking editors (those holding multiple board positions), women comprise only 22.5%, and scholars from Western Europe and North America dominate both numerically and structurally: editors with the highest eigenvector centrality are concentrated almost exclusively in these regions, while Latin America and Africa contribute only two interlocking editors each. A two-dimensional typology combining median eigenvector centrality with Gini coefficients distinguishes four configurations of symbolic capital across journals: concentrated core, dispersed core, concentrated periphery, and dispersed periphery. Critically, journals’ positions in editorial interlock networks align only partially with their citation-based intellectual centrality, demonstrating that governance structures and knowledge networks represent distinct dimensions of academic power. This reproducible analytical framework enables systematic comparison of editorial governance structures across fields.",

We test two implementable policies: a Time-Indexed Minimum Wage (TIMW) that sets the wage floor by rule wmin,t = Ct/Htarget to cap essentials at 120 hours/month, and an Essential Hours Tax Credit (EHTC) that refunds gaps below 100 hours/month for low-wage cohorts via monthly advances. Using CPI components and CPS/OEWS wages across six metros, we show how TIMW stabilizes MSH near target while EHTC backstops D1–D3 renters during shocks, delivering a dual-key hours guarantee without price controls.

          "abstract": "In recent years, Europe has experienced an increasing number of devastating floods. In 2023 alone, 26 flood events were reported in the first nine months of the year. Two of such events were the floods that hit the Italian regions of Emilia Romagna in May 2023 and Tuscany in November 2023. Using an original survey instrument on a representative sample of the Italian population of residents in Emilia Romagna and Tuscany, we investigate individuals’ climate adaptation and mitigation responses, including their preparedness against extreme climatic events and the determinants of such preparedness, their perception of flood risk likelihood across key life domains, their support for green policies, and their intention to adopt mitigation measures. We further examine whether targeted risk communication can enhance these climate adaptation and mitigation responses through two pre-registered randomized experiments testing the causal impact of flood risk information on the same set of outcomes. Our findings reveal that respondents were highly unprepared, with around 70% per cent of the sample having never taken any action to equip their home to handle extreme climatic events. The experimental results demonstrate that the provision of information on floods’ risk through an effective video message significantly improves individuals’ pro-environmental behavior, their perception of the danger of floods, and their intention to vote for a political coalition that will prioritize on combating climate change. Providing information on flood risk can thus contribute to promoting the vast support for the necessary actions to address the climate crisis.",

Existing research shows that sexism may be a stronger predictor of political attitudes and voting behaviour than a voter’s gender. To what extent do the findings from the US presidential elections apply to other contexts and research questions? To answer this question, we present a systematic review of studies focusing on sexism as a predictor of political attitudes and voting behaviour. In two databases (Scopus and Web of Science), we identify 97 relevant studies, including 42 on the 2016 US presidential elections. The review shows that particularly modern and hostile sexism played a role in Trump's election. However, few other research questions have been answered with similar certainty. Our review discovers gaps in the literature and proposes further directions for this growing research field. To enable future comparative research, we discuss best practices for measuring sexism and show the variety of ways in which sexism is operationalized.",

          "abstract": "Dementia is a major challenge in our aging society. Apart from its health economic impact, cognitive decline may affect the quality of life (QoL) and affective states of individuals. From a measurement perspective, it is of high importance to use quality-assured measurements to derive valid and reliable results. This paper investigates to what extent improved memory metrics can be exploited to investigate the strength of correlation between memory ability, depressive symptoms, and well-being. It also aims to shed light on earlier heterogeneous results through the application of quality-assured measurements. In this paper, we analyzed associations between memory ability, measured by the new and more accurate NeuroMET Memory Metric (NMM), and depressive symptoms and wellbeing of the same individuals measured using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the WHOQoL-BREF of older individuals (n=332, ranging from healthy controls to patients with dementia due to suspected Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), with a mean age of 72 years). While decreased memory ability was moderately associated with more depressive symptoms (Pearson R = -0.36), it was only negligibly associated with worse well-being (associations with WHOQoL-BREF and subdomains ranging between R = 0.08 and 0.12), which is partly in line with previous studies. A group-wise analysis revealed that these effects were stronger for individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Our study leveraged measurements scales and models with improved accuracy.",

Drawing from lived experience, I explore how simple acts of care—like adjusting a cup of tea or offering a gentle hug—can build trust and emotional connection between staff and residents. I reflect on moments of challenge and growth, particularly in understanding residents' preferences, building rapport, and responding to non-verbal cues. Central to the narrative is the concept of “huggerholics”—residents who welcome warmth and affectionate gestures—and the emotional reciprocity this role offers. This piece highlights how aged care work, especially in hospitality roles, can be a source of meaning and healing, not just for those being served but also for those serving. Through this reflection, I hope to contribute to a richer understanding of person-centred care and the importance of emotional labour in aged care settings.",

          "abstract": "The Multicultural Systems Approach (MSA) proposes a shift from viewing culture as a set of static, national traits toward understanding it as a dynamic system of interdependent cultural logics operating within organizations. Building upon general systems theory, intercultural management, and organizational behavior, the MSA conceptualizes multicultural interaction as the negotiation of equilibrium among diverse cultural subsystems, each with distinct assumptions about hierarchy, communication, time, and coordination.\nUnlike established frameworks such as Hofstede’s dimensions or the GLOBE project, the MSA emphasizes interactional dynamics and feedback loops rather than categorical differences. It accounts for how multicultural teams and institutions co-create hybrid cultural orders, shaping both performance and cohesion. This article introduces the theoretical architecture of MSA, clarifying its axioms, levels of analysis, and principles of Cultural Alignment. By reframing intercultural management through a systemic lens, MSA contributes to theory by explaining how and why multicultural collaboration succeeds or fails—and provides an integrative platform for future empirical research on cultural systems in organizations.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Beached Whale Hypothesis, a conceptual framework linking nationalism to collective cognitive disorientation. Drawing analogies from marine strandings, it interprets socio-political extremism as a product of affective and informational imbalance. The proposed Tensional Realignment Model (TRM) offers a neurocognitive explanation for how societies recalibrate emotional, temporal, and structural equilibrium through distributed tension management. Integrating insights from affective neuroscience, ecological systems theory, and social dynamics, the study situates nationalism as an emergent symptom of affective compression under digital acceleration. By comparing the global diffusion of the MAGA movement with the evolution of Japanese online nationalism, the paper frames digital populism as a “magnetic realignment failure.” The TRM thus proposes a post-national governance approach that sustains adaptability and emotional diversity by restoring systemic oscillation between affective and informational poles.",
