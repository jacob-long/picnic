          "authors": "Alejandra Manco Vega",
          "abstract": "New forms of questionable research practices (QRP) and even scientific misconduct practices are emerging in an open science environment. This work documents this transformation in three very different countries, Brazil, France, and Peru, using semi-structured interviews with researchers working in basic sciences: Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. The significant findings are that the hierarchical structure of academia contributes to the spread of research misconduct, and QRP and open science practices can potentially serve as effective tools for preventing and detecting these issues; however, it is the hierarchical structure of academia which undermines its effectivity as behaviours hiding misconducts go unnoticed. The main conclusion is that power relations between different actors in academia are still very present despite the countries' different ethical norms and the researchers' open science practices. The main recommendation is to work on aligning open science policies and policies on ethics and QRPs.",

          "authors": "Emily Kondo; Alyssa Herman; Leo Bordeaux; Alayna L Park",
          "abstract": "In response to increasing prevalence rates of suicide and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in the United States, researchers have developed online mental health resources (e.g., fact sheets) to address barriers preventing those in need from receiving mental health information and care. To identify potential strategies to increase the accessibility, actionability, and reach of those resources, this study (1) determined the audiences that online suicide and NSSI resources are written for, (2) evaluated the extent to which those resources include evidence-based prevention strategies, (3) characterized how resources communicate information about suicide and NSSI, and (4) determined whether resource characteristics predicted participants’ ratings of resources. Undergraduate students (N = 366; 68% White) rated subsets of 59 suicide and NSSI resources for personal relevance, understandability, usability, approval, and likelihood of recommending that online resource. The resources were coded for specified audience demographics, evidence-based prevention strategies, and communication techniques. Results showed that most resources were written for a specified audience (61%), included evidence-based prevention strategies (100%), and had a high school or undergraduate reading level (92%). Results from linear regression analyses indicated that specified audience demographics (e.g., youth, adults), prevention strategies (i.e., support networking), and communication techniques (i.e., tone) featured in resources predicted recommendation and approval ratings. Findings demonstrate that while there are many online resources available to the public, they may not be accessible, culturally responsive, or usable. This research can inform the development of more relevant mental health resources for individuals with suicidal ideation and NSSI.",

          "authors": "David Březina",
          "abstract": "Typeface design, i.e. the way the characters from a particular font are drawn, affects the similarity and legibility of character shapes and, consequently, reading performance. Yet, character recognition and similarity studies are usually conducted with stimuli from a single font and script which makes the results difficult to generalise. This paper reports on a study conducted to examine the perceived similarity in a range of common typefaces intended for continuous reading in Cyrillic, Devanagari, and Latin scripts. A new experimental approach (contextual similarity task) was used in order to avoid stimulus presentation that would be detrimental to the quality of typeface designs (e.g. low resolution, small size, short exposure time). Participants were presented with character triplets and asked to pick the odd one out, thus judging the remaining two characters as more similar. The cognitively simple, yet challenging, task was used to obtain data that permit a more detailed and realistic enquiry of internal character representations to better understand character similarity relationships. The diverse selection of typefaces, world scripts, and participants (n=1721) challenged the robustness of the method and illustrated its transferability across world scripts. The results of comparisons across typefaces and with other studies showed that the contextual similarity task is sensitive to the effects of typeface design and elicits similarity judgements that are hard to predict using typical similarity matrices derived from tasks with pairs or individual characters. Comparison across groups of participants with different script expertise showed no significant difference in their similarity judgements.",

          "abstract": "Social interaction is widely considered to bolster well-being and fulfill fundamental relatedness needs. However, much less is known about potential costs of social interaction, such as loss of autonomy. Here, we test a potential relatedness–autonomy tradeoff by comparing feelings of connectedness and autonomy when people were socially interacting versus not. College student participants completed experience sampling method (ESM) self-reports (N = 352, 10,046 observations) of their momentary social interactions, feelings of social connectedness, autonomy, and positive affect. We found that people report lower autonomy when interacting with others compared to when alone. This is especially true for people higher in trait attachment avoidance. However, interaction partner matters: people report higher autonomy during interactions with romantic partners compared to when alone. Our study findings provide ecologically valid evidence for a tradeoff between relatedness and autonomy during social interactions with non-romantic others.",

          "abstract": "Objective: The aesthetic qualities of psychedelic experiences have long been documented, but their specific contribution to therapeutic outcomes remains unexplored. This study investigates the role of psychedelic-induced aesthetic experiences in predicting positive psychological outcomes. Methods: Using a cross-sectional naturalistic survey, participants who had recently used classic psychedelics such as psilocybin, LSD, or DMT completed measures assessing their acute experiences, including the novel Psychedelic Aesthetic Experience Questionnaire (PAEQ), the Mystical Experience Questionnaire, the Emotional Breakthrough Inventory (EBI), and the Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ). Post-experience psychological outcomes were evaluated using the Psychological Insight Scale (PIS) and general outcome measures, such as depression, anxiety, and quality of life. Results: We found significant positive correlations and predictive relationships between aesthetic experiences and emotional breakthroughs, psychological insight, mystical experiences, and general outcomes, while negative correlations and predictions were observed between aesthetic quality and challenging experiences such as fear and paranoia. Conclusions: These findings suggest that aesthetic enhancements during psychedelic sessions are associated with positive emotional engagement and cognitive shifts, which contribute to lasting psychological benefits. The inverse relationship between aesthetic quality and challenging experiences highlights the potential of optimizing the aesthetic environment during psychedelic therapy to improve therapeutic outcomes.",

          "authors": "Kiana Marie Sabugo; James C. Elliott; Jonathan Schooler; Elliott Daniel Ihm; John Protzko; Benjamin Baird; Madeleine Gross",
          "abstract": "While meditation research has primarily focused on mental health outcomes and immediate cognitive and affective benefits, little is known about its influence on higher-order beliefs, such as views on free will and personal agency. Despite substantial references to free will and related concepts in Buddhist philosophy, to our knowledge, there has been no empirical work investigating the relationship between intensive meditation experience and belief in free will. The current study used a quasi-experimental approach to examine the influence of an 8-week intensive meditation retreat and a podcast comparison group on free will belief (FWB; as measured using the Free Will subscale of the Free Will Inventory). FWB was measured both at the beginning and end of the retreat. First, greater experience in meditation (measured in self-reported years meditating) was negatively correlated with belief in free will at the outset, suggesting that individuals with more meditation experience tended to have lower belief in free will. Next, changes in FWB were compared between the retreat group and the podcast comparison group who had access to the same instructional content via audio recordings. Overall, there was a decrease in free will belief for the retreat group, but free will belief for the podcast comparison group remained the same. Thus, the current study provides evidence that intensive meditation is associated with lower beliefs in free will, possibly driven by the influence of meditation on phenomenology of thought and changes in perception of the self. Furthermore, the current results suggest that measuring higher-order beliefs may be especially relevant when assessing mindfulness and meditation practices in applied settings.",

          "abstract": "Advances in computer science–specifically in the development and use of generative machine learning–have provided powerful new tools for psychologists to create synthetic human faces as stimuli, which ultimately provide high-quality photorealistic face images that have many advantages, including avoiding ethical and privacy concerns and generating face images from minoritized communities that are typically underrepresented in existing face databases. However, there are a number of ways that using machine learning-based face generation and manipulation software can introduce bias into the research process, thus threatening the validity of studies. The present article provides a summary of how one class of recently popular algorithms for generating faces–generative adversarial networks (GANs)--works, how we control GANs, and where biases (with a particular focus on racial biases) emerge throughout these processes. We discuss recommendations for mitigating these biases, as well as how these concepts manifest in similar modern text-to-image algorithms.",

He begins by providing an overview of his journey from L1 educator to L2 researcher and explains the development of his Linguistic Coding Differences Hypothesis (LCDH). Next, he reviews Peter Skehan’s influential research on language aptitude and L1-L2 relationships and summarizes research showing that IDs in L1 ability are universal, can be identified early, and are stable over time. Then, he reviews his group’s research on L1-L2 relationships and IDs in L2 learning, focusing on their longitudinal studies and reporting two new studies that examine the relationship between L1 achievement and L2 aptitude on the MLAT. He posits that the development of L1 literacy leads to growth in metalinguistic awareness, which enhances L1 literacy skills, and that L1 literacy and metalinguistic awareness provide the foundation for L2 aptitude, the ability to use and understand “decontextualized” material. The author concludes by proposing an answer to the paper’s title.",

          "authors": "Philip Dale; richard lee sparks",
          "abstract": "Despite the longstanding recognition of substantial individual differences (IDs) in L2 attainment, SLA/L2 researchers have a history of focusing primarily on universal characteristics and processes of language development. Theoretical work has failed to note and explore the nature and role of the strong evidence for large and stable IDs in early L1 attainment in all components of language development. Extensive research has also shown that there are strong relationships among IDs in L1 achievement, L2 aptitude, and L2 achievement outcomes. More recent investigations have found that prediction from the Modern Language Aptitude Test (MLAT), the strongest single predictor of L2 achievement, may be due largely to MLAT’s assessment of L1 abilities, reinforcing the position that IDs in L2 achievement are strongly related to and constrained by L1 achievement. Despite the evidence that students’ L2 achievement is closely related to their L1 achievement developed prior to L2 exposure, SLA/L2 researchers have largely failed to consider L1 skills as a factor that explains IDs in L2 achievement. Several hypotheses are proposed to explain why SLA/L2 researchers consider IDs in L1 attainment to be unimportant for L2 achievement.",

          "abstract": "Human language may have evolved as a tool of our complex interactional system. This hypothesis is \nsupported by the results of studies showing that human and non-human primates share some \ninteractional abilities. These comparative studies are sparse however, and their methodologies vary, \nmost of them focusing on a single communication modality, which makes inter-specific comparisons \ndifficult. We propose a new approach together with an open-access code (“Multi-interaction”) that \naim at simplifying the study of multimodal interactions and can be applied for comparison purposes \nto many species, regardless of their communication repertoire. First, we choose to annotate all \nmultimodal behaviors (i.e., communication signals and actions) that contribute to the informational \ncontent of the interaction and its overall structure. Second, the code we provide enables multimodal \nannotated interactions to be transcribed into unique sequences, using a method that preserves the \nfollowing information: the units making up the interaction, their order of appearance, their emitter, \ntheir potential overlap (intra- and/or inter-individual) and their duration. Third, the code provides \nautomatic computation of several quantitative measures that describe the overall structure of each \ninteraction, such as overall duration, number of units, diversity of units, percentage of inter?individual overlap, percentage of intra-individual superposition or each individual \"presence\" rate during the interaction. We aim to facilitate the processing of multimodal and multi-agent interaction data, enabling large datasets and species comparisons to be handled. By focusing on structure rather than meaning, we hope to promote human-decentered and species-general protocols in the study of interactions in primates, including humans.",

          "abstract": "Sequences of choice response times exhibit ubiquitous and strong multi-scale dynamics (i.e., sequential dependencies across a broad range of temporal scales). Despite their pervasive nature, multi-scale dynamics are poorly understood. We show that dynamics in the seconds to minutes range can be explained by the superposition of several distinct learning and control mechanisms. Each mechanism learns a representation of the structure of the choice environment and/or an aspect of the decision maker’s ability. These representations are updated after each choice and used to control the next decision by modulating the parameters of an evidence-accumulation process with sub-second range dynamics that determine individual choices. We link these mechanisms to three major foci in the experimental study of sequential dependencies: stimulus-history, error-related, and hard-easy effects. This account provides a detailed explanation of both multi-scale dynamics of choice sequences, and the three effects, at the group and individual levels.",

The studies exploring the impact of CLIL programs on content learning are scarce and produce inconsistent results.\nAims: The current study examines the acquisition of academic content learned in a foreign language in CLIL education, when pupils are tested in the main school language.\nSample: The sample consisted of 725 sixth grade primary and twelfth grade secondary education pupils enrolled in CLIL and in non-CLIL, in French-speaking Belgium.\nMethods: Content learning was examined by collecting the end-of-curriculum official external evaluations for the participants. The external evaluation for primary pupils focused on mathematics, history and geography, sciences, and French, while it focused on history and French for secondary pupils. The particularity of these evaluations is that they are identical for all schools in French-speaking Belgium.\nResults: Although academic subjects are instructed in a foreign, non-dominant language (i.e., English or Dutch), CLIL pupils successfully achieve their school curriculum (just like non-CLIL pupils do) and are able to acquire content in a foreign language, even though the assessment takes place in the main school language (i.e., French). These results remained stable even when controlling for cognitive and demographic confounding variables.\nConclusion: CLIL pupils do not seem to be at a disadvantage for the acquisition of academic content, compared to non-CLIL pupils.",

          "abstract": "Ethnocultural empathy is a culturally specific empathy involving processes associated with perspective-taking, emotion regulation, and social cognition while considering the cultural differences emerging from interactions between people with different racial or ethnic backgrounds. This study aimed to adapt The Scale of Ethnocultural Empathy (SEE; Wang et al., 2003) to the Romanian cultural context and to assess its reliability and validity. Employing exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on a sample of adult Romanians (N = 466), we obtained a 20-item three-factor revised version that fitted the data adequately. All three scales of the revised SEE have an appropriate level of convergent and discriminant validity, as given by Average Variance Extracted coefficients (AVEs), and good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The scale was invariant across genders and age categories. Ethnocultural empathy, as measured with SEE, exhibited positive and significant correlations with general empathy, the cultural diversity within the respondents’ social network, Agreeableness and Openness to Experience, and negative correlations with Psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and behavioral intentions of social distancing towards people from other racial or ethnic groups. We further proposed a 9-item short form of SEE (SEE-SF), which is a more parsimonious measure with a balanced number of items within each subscale. Both scale versions are robust measures of ethnocultural empathy with good psychometric properties. Based on these findings, we discuss the practical implications of ethnocultural empathy skills in a growing multicultural society.",

However, evidence remains inconclusive, particularly with regards to the possible links with psychopathology and the scarcity of substantial data on Italian-speaking individuals.\n\nMethods\nWe quantified a large set of prosodic and voice quality features from a free speech task conducted with Italian-speaking individuals with and without schizophrenia (SCZ – 29; CTR – 29), using a fully automated pipeline. Moreover, in the SCZ group we thoroughly assessed psychopathology using the Thought Language and Communication scale (TLC), the Clinical Language Disorder Rating scale (CLANG), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS), the Examination of Anomalous Self Experience Scale (EASE) and the Autism Rating Scale (ARS).\n\nResults\nRelative to CTR, SCZ showed a different acoustic profile, with reduced speech rate and increased pause duration, fundamental frequency variability and breathy phonation. Temporal profile features were associated with most of the psychopathology tested, in particular with symptoms related to communication atypicalities but also to subjective experiences related to self and others. Other acoustic features related to pitch and intonation were associated with negative symptoms of schizophrenia and subjective experiences related to others.\n\nConclusions\nThis study shows for the first time significant differences in prosody and voice quality in Italian speaking people with schizophrenia, as compared to neurotypical controls. Moreover, significant relationships between speech acoustic profile and fine psychopathology were found. Future research should expand this approach to transdiagnostic and cross-linguistic samples, to test the specificity of the investigated patterns.

However, according to exploratory analyses, the slope of change in treatment outcomes was not significantly different between programs during the treatment and follow-up phases. As hypothesized, patients who used SilverCloud self-reported significantly greater subjective engagement with their iCBT program compared to patients who used TWU (d=0.36). However, contrary to hypotheses, client satisfaction was not significantly different between programs. This non-randomized program evaluation offers minimal evidence that one program was better than the other, though findings require replication in a randomized controlled trial and larger sample.

          "abstract": "Background: It's clear that the lasting impact of childhood events on mental health, specifically focusing on the concept of \"polyvictimization\" as a condition rather than isolated events. This is a key area of research, and understanding the incidence and effects of polyvictimization is crucial for developing effective interventions and support systems. \n\nObjective: The objective of this study is to determine the incidence of polyvictimization in Iran and to compare its occurrence among different socioeconomic status (SES) groups and various sexual orientations within the subtypes of polyvictimization. Additionally, using the Barratt Impulsivity Scale, we investigate the prediction of impulsivity based on victimization.\nMethods: The study was conducted during the summer of 2023 and involved 573 adult participants aged 18 to 45 years. A demographic questionnaire, the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire (JVQ) developed by Finkelhor and colleagues (2011), and the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11) were administered online. Participants were recruited through non-randomized sampling via social media platforms such as Telegram, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Data were collected by researchers, and descriptive statistics, ANOVA, post-hoc, and regression analysis were conducted using SPSS 26 and AMOS 26.\n\nResults: Out of the 573 participants (72.8% female; total mean age: 24.04; female mean age: 23.89; male mean age: 24.46), the average childhood victimization score was 11.95. Notably, 80.6% of participants were classified as high polyvictims (having experienced 7 or more types of victimization). Those with lower SES reported higher levels of victimization, and transgender individuals experienced higher victimization rates compared to other sexual orientation groups. To predict impulsivity based on victimization, the results of the regression analysis indicated that victimization significantly predicts cognitive impulsivity, motor impulsivity.\n\nConclusion: The rates of victimization in Iran exceed those in many other countries, including low-income nations. Considering the significant impact of victimization on mental health, further research is necessary to identify the root causes and potential interventions to alleviate the consequences of trauma.\n\nKeywords: Impulsivity, Incidence, Polyvictimization.",

          "abstract": "While reading narrative texts, the reader’s thoughts and attention often fluctuate from thoughts related to the content of the text (e.g., immersion into the story world), to thoughts unrelated to the text (e.g., mind-wandering). Research on mind-wandering and immersion suggests that these types of thought patterns influence the reading process in different ways. In this article, we examine the types of thoughts readers have while reading a literary text. Specifically, we investigated the effect of immersion and mind-wandering episodes on eye-movement behavior during reading. Fifty-six participants took part in the experiment and read extracts from Siri Hustvedt ”Memories of the Future” while their eye-movements were monitored. Participants’ thoughts were probed at regular intervals during reading using the multidimensional experience sampling method. We identified four thought components using principal component analysis on the responses to the prompts: Immersion, Mind-wandering, Sub-Vocalization, and Social Episodic Thoughts. We then ran General Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) to examine the effect of these four thought types on eye movement behaviour and reading processes. Specifically, we examined the effect of thought types on the word frequency effect. Results show that eye movement behaviour and processing are influenced by the types of thoughts readers experience while reading literary texts. These results have important implications for the way that mind-wandering is typically investigated, particularly in reading research.",

          "authors": "Emily Ann Hughes; Joanne Smith",
          "abstract": "Drawing upon both social identity and balanced identity theories, the Social Identity Model of Behavioural Associations (SIMBA) presents a novel way of conceptualising and measuring the relationships among the constructs of social identity, group norms, and individual-level behaviour—that is, as cognitive-behavioural associations that mutually interact in a triadic constellation and can be measured both implicitly and explicitly. While the social identity approach suggests that the interaction between social identification and group norms shapes our individual behaviour, the SIMBA—through adopting the methodological underpinnings of balanced identity theory—advances upon this theorising to highlight that interactions among the three constructs are reciprocal and extend to the prediction of both social identification and group norms. Across four studies (total N=540), we tested the SIMBA in the context of drinking behaviour in relation to student (Studies 1, 2, and 3) and British national (Study 4) identities. On implicit measures, there was good support for the prediction that the strength of any one association in the SIMBA could be predicted by the interactive strength of the remaining two. Evidence for this prediction was largely absent on explicit Likert-type measures; we argue that this difference may be dependent on the explicit measures possessing theoretically meaningful zero-points.",

          "abstract": "We reflect on the concept of wisdom from a social psychological lens, with particular focus on the discrepancy between dynamic theories of wisdom and the largely atemporal nature of existing empirical evidence. Upon reviewing theoretical models of the key components of wisdom such as intellectual humility, open-mindedness, and empathy/perspective-taking, we outline how these characteristics differ across situational contexts. Next, we posit that the temporal dimension—essential to virtually all theories of wisdom—is paradoxically neglected or misinterpreted in empirical studies. Our findings are supported by a systematic review of literature, demonstrating that many conclusions about the development and effects of wisdom are based on insufficient, atemporal data. We outline several steps to address these challenges in wisdom and social psychological research more broadly, including enhanced sampling and modelling practices, to foster a temporally precise, social psychological understanding of wisdom-related characteristics.",

Furthermore, we administered the Big-Five personality test to understand if specific personality traits could influence the aesthetic judgments of subjects.\nOur findings include: i) creative judgments significantly correlate with both perceived pleasantness and emotional intensity across all possible worlds; ii) individuals tend to consider human-created artworks more creative only when they possess information about the authorship (PW-E and PW-AE); iii) artificially-generated artworks evoke more intense and positive emotions when people have no information about authorship (PW-A); iv) extroverted participants tend to find artworks generated by artificial systems more appealing when lacking information about the artworks' provenance.",

The soundscapes of the Anthropocene are frequently characterized by an overabundance of sound sources, the vast majority of which are functionally irrelevant to a given listener. The problem of listening to speech in such environments must be solved by an auditory system that is not optimized for this task. So what does it mean to ''restore'' hearing for people with hearing loss? How might evolution optimize the sense of hearing for our world today? Building on our previous work on the two-competitor model and incorporating an active inference approach using free energy minimization, we argue that the answers to these question have implications not just for the study of human audition, but also for the development and broad awareness of hearing aids and cochlear implants, as well other auditory technologies such as ear buds, immersive auditory environments, and systems for human-machine interaction.",

          "abstract": "Background: Romantic relationships significantly influence physical and mental health. Existing measures of marital or relationship satisfaction often face limitations such as low internal consistency, excessive length, focus on counseling settings, or applicability only to married individuals. With evolving partnership dynamics, a concise and reliable tool applicable across various relationship types is needed. This study aimed to revise the Kansas Marital Satisfaction Scale (KMSS) to assess general relationship satisfaction and evaluate its psychometric properties.\n\nMethods: The original KMSS was modified to encompass satisfaction in all types of romantic partnerships. Two samples were utilized: the first (n = 280) to explore basic psychometric characteristics and validity, and the second (n = 946) for a detailed examination of the scale's functioning. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) assessed the factor structure, while item response theory (IRT) analyses evaluated item characteristics. Measurement invariance across gender and marital status was tested. Hypotheses regarding associations with neuroticism, well-being, education, gender, and age were examined.\n\nResults: The revised KMSS demonstrated excellent psychometric properties, with high reliability (Cronbach's α &gt; 0.90) and a unidimensional factor structure confirmed by CFA. Measurement invariance was established across genders and between married and unmarried participants. IRT analysis indicated high discrimination parameters for all items. The KMSS score was negatively associated with trait neuroticism (r = –0.11, p &lt; 0.001) and positively associated with well-being (r = 0.28, p &lt; 0.001). No significant associations were found between KMSS scores and length of relationship, education level, gender, or age after controlling for covariates.\n\nConclusion: The revised KMSS is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing relationship satisfaction across diverse types of partnerships. Its brevity and robust psychometric properties make it suitable for future research exploring the links between relationship satisfaction and health outcomes.",

The detrimental effects of youth adversity on mental health are often buffered by social support, but whether this depends on the intersection of multiple characteristics is unknown.\nMethods: Analysis of cross-sectional self-reported data for 5,662 11-13-year-olds from the Determinants of Adolescent Social well-being and Health [DASH] study. Indirect effects of youth adversity on depression/anxiety via parental and peer support were estimated in a structural equation model, for 16 intersectionality profiles (based on gender, socio-economic status [SES], and ethnicity). Moderation attributable to these characteristics and their intersections was estimated.\nResults: Youth adversity had a detrimental impact on depression/anxiety across all intersectionality profiles (b=0.08-0.36, p=0.02). Parental and peer support did not mediate the effect of youth adversity on depression/anxiety broadly across profiles. However, a weak indirect effect of parental nurturing was observed for the Lower SES South Asian Female profile (θ=0.12 [&lt;0.01, 0.26]). \nConclusions: The harmful effects of youth adversity on adolescent mental health pervade across different societal intersections. Future research should refine the methods needed to investigate the mechanisms including structural conditions through which youth adversity operates, to inform the design of effective interventions.",

          "abstract": "Western democracies struggle with high levels of distrust and cynicism towards political institutions. In countering this phenomenon, various local governments have been experimenting with citizen participation. In a large and representative sample of Belgian-Flemish citizens (N=2,205), we investigate whether the impact level and type of participation affects people’s perception of these initiatives. Impact level was operationalized through four different decision-making scenarios regarding an emblematic local policy case: repurposing an abandoned school building. Types of participation were operationalized through concrete participatory instruments (e.g., citizen panels, referendums), which varied both in how the input is solicited (aggregation or deliberation) and the extent of citizen influence (advisory or binding). Results show that participants perceived participatory scenarios as more legitimate than traditional representation, with the most outspoken preference for co-decision between government and citizens. As for concrete instruments, citizen consultations are most widely favored, and aggregation (consultations or referenda) is slightly preferred over deliberation (citizen panels). Individual differences showed modest effects on preferences, primarily affecting attitudes towards the participatory extremes (i.e., no input or full autonomy), and the relative preference of aggregative (referenda) versus deliberative (citizen panels) instruments. Altogether, this study provides useful guidelines for policy-makers who aim to cultivate legitimate participatory practices.",

Giving citizens a more direct say through referendums has been proposed as one way to tackle this problem. In a large, representative sample of the Belgian-Flemish population (N=2205), we find that referendums appeal strongly to political cynics. However, when investigating their practical implementation, a different trend emerges. In a targeted survey of residents of a major Belgian-Flemish city (N=773), where the government organized local top-down referendums, political cynics were more critical and less likely to participate. This seemingly ironic finding was partially explained by political cynics’ tendency to disparage the specific issues addressed in these referendums, considering them as relatively less important. Our findings suggest that with suboptimal topic selection, local referendums may risk further alienating disillusioned citizens rather than reengaging them.",

          "abstract": "Sleep problems and perceived stress are linked to mental health outcomes. Epidemiological studies suggest that the effect of perceived stress on depressive symptoms is partially mediated by poor sleep quality. Naturalistic associations among perceived stress, affect, sleep quality, and depressive symptoms have not been thoroughly explored. We examine within-person associations among sleep, perceived stress, and affect in a naturalistic setting and the moderating effect of depression. Participants were 167 individuals (136 women, 29 men, 2 other gender) who completed a 21-day daily diary assessment. Multilevel models revealed that perceived stress (b = -0.01, p = 0.04) and negative affect (b = -0.05, p = 0.04) were lower than usual following nights of longer than usual sleep duration. In participants experiencing depression, increases in last night’s sleep quality were associated with decreases in next-day perceived stress (b = -0.02, p = 0.001) and negative affect (b = -0.01, p &lt; 0.001). Within-person mediation analyses indicated that last night’s sleep impacts negative affect via changes in perceived stress. Participants with depression experienced lower negative affect following nights of higher than usual sleep quality. Controlling for between-person differences in sleep duration and quality, within-person fluctuations in sleep duration and quality impacted next-day perceived stress and affect across populations. The daily functioning of individuals experiencing depression was especially sensitive to naturalistic fluctuations in sleep occurring in daily life, suggesting sleep may be a sensitive target for interventions that aim to reduce daily stress and negative affect in depression.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence is a formative period in which individuals become more aware of societal needs. To solve global collective challenges, it is critical to encourage prosociality in this developmental phase. School peers play a large role in acquiring prosocial norms and behaviors, yet their influence is rarely investigated experimentally. To understand if peer influence can be harnessed to promote prosociality, we set out to identify the most influential individuals within adolescents’ classroom social networks. In a pre-registered field experiment, we tested whether 456 adolescents aged 11 to 19, conformed more often to high- or low-status peers from their social network. Participants played an incentivized donation game where they could donate money to several charities or keep it to themselves. They could revise their decision upon observing the real choice of a known peer from their classroom. By manipulating the status of the observed sources, we show that high-status peers are consistently the most influential across all age groups, while overall peer influence declines with age.  Based on the social networks and conformity rates measured in the experiment, we simulated social contagion interventions to identify conditions that maximize the diffusion of prosocial behaviors. Simulation results show that picking central individuals as “influencers”, increases intervention effectiveness. Our study suggests that high-status adolescents can be agents of prosocial change, thanks to their influence and visibility within social networks.",

          "abstract": "Even though we can have successful conversations without seeing each other (e.g., in phone conversations), visual cues can further support speech comprehension. For example, speech is often produced together with co-speech hand gestures. Beat gestures specifically tend to co-occur with prominent words in a sentence, typically aligning to the stressed syllable. Hence, the alignment of beat gestures with specific syllables can affect spoken word recognition. For example, a beat gesture produced and aligned to a given syllable biases participants to perceive stress on this syllable. However, previous studies have primarily tested words in isolation and words with lexical stress competitors (e.g., CONtent vs. conTENT), where the beat gesture was crucial to disambiguate the word. Hence, it is unclear if beat gestures also support lexical access in more naturalistic conditions, such as when hearing words without a lexical stress competitor (e.g., Dutch LEger; English ARmy) in semantically constraining sentences. To answer this question, we presented participants with videos of a talker producing semantically constraining sentences containing a critical disyllabic sentence-final target in a lexical decision task. The target was either produced without a gesture or accompanied by a beat gesture aligned to the first or second syllable. Response times showed that participants were generally faster when the target was presented together with a beat gesture, regardless of its within-word alignment. Moreover, we found that this facilitatory effect was larger for words than pseudowords. These results provide evidence that beat gestures – even when they are not essential for successful speech comprehension – affect lexical access in highly constraining contexts.",

We analysed the valence (positive, neutral, negative) of the bystander news stories – and coded the prevalence of concepts from Western and Chinese theories of bystander behaviour. In Western media, bystanders were predominately presented in a neutral or positive way, with fewer than 5% of news headlines and stories having a negative valence. In contrast, Chinese media presented significantly more negative portrayals of bystanders, with negative depictions being as frequent as neutral or positive ones.

Our evaluation centered on abstracts from the field of psychology, covering different research domains within this discipline. We explored how characteristics of the screening data, such as the proportion of relevant articles, the overall frequency of abstracts, and the amount of training data influenced the effectiveness of these algorithms. A key finding was that the algorithm combining the logistic regression classifier with the SBERT feature extractor outperformed other algorithms, demonstrating both the highest efficiency and the lowest variability in performance. Nonetheless, the algorithm's performance varied across experimental conditions. We discussed the results and derived practical recommendations to guide users in the AI-aided screening process.",

This misperception was robust to different thresholds of harmful content and operationalizations of harmful content. An experiment revealed that overestimating the proportion of social media users who post harmful content makes people feel more negative emotion, perceive the U.S. to be in greater moral decline, and encourages distorted perceptions of what others desire to see on social media. However, these effects can be mitigated through a targeted intervention that corrects this misperception. Together, our findings highlight a novel perceptual mechanism that may explain why social media use can harm well-being and undermine social cohesion.",

          "abstract": "How do children learn what a word means when its uses are consistent with many possible\nmeanings? One influential idea is that children rely on an inductive bias that ensures that novel\nwords get assigned distinct meanings from known words – Mutual Exclusivity. Here, we explore\nthe possibility that Mutual Exclusivity phenomena do not reflect a bias, but rather information\nencoded in the message: learners might effectively be told when and when not to assume that\nword meanings are mutually exclusive. In three experiments (N=106, ages 2;0−2;11 from across\nthe United States), we show that 2-year-olds only assume that novel words have distinct\nmeanings if the words were spoken with 'focus', an information-structural marker of contrast.\nWithout focus, we found no Mutual Exclusivity; novel words were understood to label familiar\nobjects. These results provide a novel account of Mutual Exclusivity and demonstrate an early-\nemerging understanding of focus and information structure.",

          "abstract": "Much has been made of the apparent capacity for creativity of generative AI. However, as research expands the knowledge base regarding the capabilities and performance of this technology, the prevailing view is shifting away from “AI is creative” and towards a more balanced model of Human-AI co-creativity. Nevertheless, even this paradigm may be impacted by untested assumptions: for example, that generative AI will boost human performance on idea generation tasks. To test that assumption this study primed subjects with lists of words purportedly either from a human or from ChatGPT, and of varying degrees of creativity. Subjects then completed the Divergent Association Task (DAT). The results of this study found no evidence of any difference in divergent thinking resulting from either the source of priming (Human/ChatGPT) or from the level of creativity of the priming (low, typical and high), with one exception: a low-creativity prime, believed to be from ChatGPT, resulted in lower scores on the DAT compared to other priming conditions. This result was supported by a regression analysis, which found that only Openness and the perceived creativity of the prime were weak predictors of the subjects’ DAT scores. The consequences of these findings for Human-AI co-creativity are discussed.",

          "authors": "Brian Maniscalco; Megan A. K. Peters",
          "abstract": "In psychophysics, it is sometimes desirable for the temporal onset of an event to be unpredictable, e.g. to control possible effects of expectation and temporal attention in behavioral or neural data. One way of achieving temporal unpredictability is to make the hazard rate of the event constant. Roughly speaking, the hazard rate measures the odds that an event will occur now or later. If the hazard rate is constant throughout a temporal interval, then the time elapsed thus far provides the observer with no information for updating their expectation of when the event will occur. A constant hazard rate thus prevents the building of predictive anticipation that the event is about to occur even as time continues to unfold. Here we consider the question of how best to control hazard rates in psychophysics experiments with time considered as either a continuous or discrete variable. We argue that for computerized psychophysics experiments, it is both more appropriate and more convenient to model time as a discrete variable. We also consider that for practical reasons, experimenters may wish to impose upper bounds on the duration of random temporal intervals. We show how hazard rate can be exactly controlled for unbounded time intervals when time is treated as either a continuous or discrete variable by using the exponential and geometric distributions, respectively. We discuss complications in controlling hazard rate for bounded time intervals and present a solution yielding exact control of hazard rate for bounded time intervals with discrete time steps using a modified form of the geometric distribution. The latter approach is likely to be the most relevant for most psychophysics experiments that seek to control hazard rate.",

          "authors": "Chengjia Ye; James McQueen; Hans Rutger Bosker",
          "abstract": "Speech is often accompanied by gestures. Since beat gestures frequently co-occur with prosodic prominence, they can indicate stress in a word and hence influence spoken-word recognition. However, little is known about the reverse influence of auditory speech on visual perception. The current study investigated whether lexical stress has an effect on the perceived timing of hand beats. We used videos in which a disyllabic word, embedded in a carrier sentence (Exp 1) or in isolation (Exp 2), was coupled with an up-and-down hand beat, while varying their degrees of asynchrony. Results from Experiment 1, a novel beat timing estimation task, revealed that gestures were estimated to occur closer in time to the pitch peak in a stressed syllable than their actual timing, hence reducing the perceived temporal difference between gestures and stress by around 60%. Using a forced-choice task, Experiment 2 further demonstrated that listeners tended to perceive a gesture, falling midway between two syllables, on the syllable receiving stronger cues to stress than the other, and the auditory effect was greater when gestural timing was most ambiguous. Our findings suggest that f0 and intensity are the driving force behind the temporal attraction effect of stress on perceived gestural timing. This study provides new evidence for auditory influences on visual perception, supporting bidirectionality in audiovisual interaction between speech-related signals that occur in everyday face-to-face communication.",

          "authors": "Damien Lekkas; Amanda C. Collins; Michael V. Heinz; Tess Z. Griffin; Arvind Pillai; Subigya Nepal; Daniel M. Mackin; Andrew T. Campbell; Nicholas C. Jacobson",
          "abstract": "Background: Despite major strides in conceptualizing and modeling the multifaceted nature of suicidal thought and behavior (STB) over the past few decades, the overall predictability of STB has not improved. This may be partly due to the dynamic nature of suicidal ideation (SI), which often fluctuates over hours, yet is largely overlooked in studies. Bolstered by the application and promise of natural language processing (NLP) across the mental health field, efforts toward richer operationalization of acute SI may include analyses on written data that occur alongside changes in SI, thus offering a better understanding of STB as it unfolds.\n\nMethods: Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data consisting of thrice-daily SI severity scores and diary entries from 268 participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) were utilized to interrogate acute changes in SI. Using difference scores and probability of acute change thresholds, eleven acute SI phase trajectory types were defined to label change in SI over three consecutive EMAs. In total, 5,938 acute SI trajectories were paired with the temporally centered diary entries. The Sentiment Analysis and Cognition Engine (SEANCE) tool was applied to quantify the written content of each diary entry across eight established lexica. Entry results were grouped based on phase trajectory type, and the Kruskall-Wallis test was employed with post-hoc multiple hypothesis correction to statistically compare SEANCE features between all group pairs.\n     \nResults: There were 130 statistically significant (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05) pairwise differences between acute SI phase trajectory groups, implicating 31 NLP features. Consistent with the literature, results highlighted qualities of writing that are generally associated with heightened SI, including personal pronoun usage, passivity, and negative valence. Patterns of significance also uncovered novel contextual nuance in terms of how characteristics such as verbosity, hostility, anger, and pleasantness present in relation to SI over short change trajectories. \n\nConclusions: This work provides an accessible exploratory framework that capitalizes on the benefits of dense EMA sampling and NLP to profile and quantify acute SI trajectories. Future research should continue to focus on short timeframes as there are likely important signals and interpretative nuances in SI that have yet to be fully detailed.",

          "abstract": "Affective computing research aims to accurately detect users' emotional states to enhance human-computer interaction. While existing studies demonstrate the ability of affective computing models to accurately detect posed expressions of emotions, there is limited investigation into their validity in detecting natural or spontaneous emotional expressions. This study examines the validity of several models in accurately detecting six basic emotional states from spontaneous expressions. Data were collected from 114 participants who viewed emotionally provocative video clips, while multi-modal information on their emotional experiences was captured (questionnaires, video recordings, audio recordings, and text). Open-source software was used to detect basic emotional states from facial expressions (Py-Feat), text (National Research Lexicon), and audio (an LTSM-DNN model). The construct validity of these measurements was assessed by correlating their relationship to self-reported emotional experiences (positive convergent validity) and Big Five personality traits (both discriminant and negative convergent validity). Data analyses demonstrated limited construct validity for automatic detection of emotion through facial expression and text, and poor construct validity through audio. These results suggest that existing models are not yet capable of accurately measuring basic emotional states in real-life settings, highlighting the critical need for improving affective computing models using spontaneous emotional data to enhance their accuracy. The Personality-Emotion Mapping (PEM) dataset is provided as a resource for training and testing these models, with the aim of facilitating more effective human-computer interactions.",

          "abstract": "Humans frequently make decisions under uncertain conditions in everyday life. A constellation of cognitive biases may drive such decisions. To further our understanding of how these biases influence decision making, we developed a novel paradigm—the Florida-And-Georgia (FLAG) gambling task. In the FLAG task, 170 young adult participants chose between a deck, which yields variable outcomes, and a sure-thing offer. This approach allows us to model experience-dependent decision making as influenced by both learning processes (e.g.,  primacy-recency bias) and key factors drawn from Prospect Theory, including sensitivity to outliers and loss aversion. Our findings reveal that individuals in their decision making underweight outliers for both gains and losses and are biased by recent outcomes, but we found no evidence of loss aversion. The FLAG task strikes a balance between ecological validity and experimental control, providing insights into the cognitive processes involved in decision making. In closing, we discuss future directions for the FLAG task and its potential societal and clinical applications.",

This experiment yielded large performance differences between recalling temporal and spatial information. In the temporal condition, participants attempted to reconstruct the temporal order of words that were positioned alphabetically within a vertical array. In the spatial condition, participants attempted to reconstruct the spatial positions of words presented in a temporal sequence based on their alphabetical order. After viewing each list, all the words appeared alphabetically, and participants reconstructed the order of the words according to their instructed condition. Compared to temporal recall, spatial recall exhibited superior performance and a more bowed symmetrical serial position function. Analyses showed the effects of temporal contiguity in the spatial condition and spatial contiguity in the temporal condition. These findings suggest that participants do not focus on the words' identities but rather on the temporal-spatial pattern in which the words occur during the study display.",

Underscoring the relevance of these findings, we identify a comparative shift toward such rhetoric in Republican versus Democratic presidents beginning around 1980, with Donald Trump exhibiting particularly extreme values. Providing experimental support, we find individuals’ support for political violence to increase after exposure to excerpts high in misplaced certainty from the 2024 Harris-Trump presidential debate.

          "abstract": "Objective: Anhedonia is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts. Treatment for anhedonia (behavioral activation) involves engaging in rewarding activities. Social media use is a rewarding activity for adolescents, and thus, a possible behavioral activation tool for adolescents experiencing anhedonia, reducing further symptom escalation (e.g., suicidal thoughts). \n\nThe current study tested: 1) Is momentary anhedonia negatively associated with looking forward to checking social media (predicted pleasure)? 2) Is momentary anhedonia associated with subsequent experiencing less positive mood on social media (actual pleasure)? 3) Are within-person changes in positive mood on social media (actual pleasure) associated with reduced likelihood of suicidal thoughts, and does this vary by levels of anhedonia? \nMethod: Sixty-two adolescents (Mage = 16.15 (0.97); 49.3% girls, 16.4% boys, 34.4% nonbinary; 40.3% white) completed ecological momentary assessments three times daily for eight weeks. All prompts asked about anhedonia, predicted pleasure from social media, and actual pleasure on social media. Evening prompts assessed daily suicidal thoughts. Multilevel models tested the above research questions. \n\nResults: Adolescents experiencing momentary anhedonia above their average levels looked forward to checking social media less. However, more-than-usual momentary anhedonia was not associated with positive mood on social media (actual pleasure). Experiencing above-average positive mood on social media was associated with decreased risk of suicidal thoughts at the daily level. This relationship was not moderated by anhedonia. \n\nConclusion: For adolescents experiencing more-than-usual anhedonia, using social media for positive mood-boosting activities could be a behavioral activation tool and may be an important protective factor against suicidal thoughts.",

Smartphone-based mobile sensing offers new opportunities to gain insights into adolescents’ SM use patterns and behaviors, particularly at an idiographic level.

          "abstract": "Don’t ask, don’t tell. The closet. The Lavender Scare. Throughout history, LGBTQ+ people have been repeatedly told to hide who they are at risk of losing jobs, housing, family, and friends. Presently, new silencing laws are on the forefront of public discourse, with many states enacting “don’t say gay” laws that prevent discussion of sexual and gender diversity in public schools. However, these laws, like other anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, may only further stigmatize LGBTQ+ people and create cultural norms of anti-LGBTQ+ attitudes. This pre-registered study examines the effects of “don’t say gay” laws on state-level anti-LGBTQ+ attitudes through time. Though new “don’t say gay” laws do not affect the trajectory of sexuality attitudes through time, states with “don’t say gay” laws have more negative implicit and explicit sexuality attitudes overall. Importantly, this effect was most robust for earlier “don’t say gay” laws that were enacted in the 1980s and 1990s. This study shows evidence that “don’t say gay” laws may relate to negative attitudes towards sexual minority people, which is important as these laws continue to be proposed, debated, and enacted across the country.",

          "abstract": "Developmental dyslexia is a disorder marked by difficulties in reading, spelling, and connecting sounds to written language. The high-level visual dysfunction hypothesis suggests these difficulties may partially arise from abnormalities in high-level visual cognition such as the ability to integrate visual input for higher-order cognitive functions such as reading.  Here we examined dyslexic readers’ neural functioning as they recognized identities of nonlinguistic visual objects, specifically houses and faces. We measured two event-related potentials (ERPs), the N170 and N250, which are linked to face and object processing – N170 with early structural encoding and N250 with familiarity and identification. In this study, dyslexic readers consistently showed reduced N250 amplitude, potentially suggesting abnormal neural processes relating to the individuation or subordinate-level representation of visual objects. This was despite similar behavioral performance for dyslexic readers. Early neural processes in dyslexic readers were largely intact as shown by their N170.  These results highlight the distinct underlying neural processes that contribute to high-level visual cognition in dyslexia and help to further our understanding of how these neural processes might contribute to reading challenges that are characteristic of the disorder.",

          "abstract": "The development of generative AI that can sustain complex conversations has created a growing market for companion chatbots promising social and emotional connection with their users. In this review and analysis, we apply theoretical tools established by over 50 years of research on relationships to evaluate the extent to which relationships between humans and chatbots fulfill this promise. Indeed, interactions between humans and chatbots do possess some of the characteristic features of close relationships: humans and chatbots can influence each other, and can engage in frequent and diverse conversations over extended periods of time. Chatbots can be responsive to their users in ways that humans perceive to be appropriate and supportive, and such responses can generate feelings of authentic connection, as well as opportunities for self-expansion and growth. Yet AI-powered chatbots cannot yet fully replicate the experience of being in a relationship with another human being. Their responses can lack depth and their ability to recall and build upon prior interactions remains limited, rendering them predictable and boring to some users. Because chatbots do not make more than the most superficial requests of their users, relationships with chatbots do not provide the many benefits of having to negotiate, compromise, and sacrifice for a partner. Although the relationships humans form with chatbots are clearly meaningful to some users, and will be preferable to social isolation for some, they have not reached the level where they can replace human relationships.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: Gentrification is the influx of rich, often White people and businesses into a neighborhood causing displacement of current residents, and is a crucial concern in many cities across the globe. City planners may laud the potential economic benefits of gentrification, but displacement often threatens established communities with little social power. The present research examines the psychological impact of gentrification on members of marginalized groups. Participants reported their attitudes towards gentrification, then viewed 30 Google Street View images of both gentrified and not gentrified neighborhoods and reported the extent to which they felt like they would belong in each. Participants with positive attitudes towards gentrification reported greater feelings of belonging in gentrified versus non-gentrified places. Additionally, regardless of their attitudes, Latine participants reported lower feelings of belonging, and White participants reported greater feelings of belonging, in gentrified versus non-gentrified areas. Our findings highlight the psychological impact of gentrification on communities that are at risk of displacement.",

Another consequence may also be a decrease in belonging, with usual victims of gentrification being disproportionately affected by perceptions of gentrification. To understand the effects of gentrification, I examined what features of buildings and neighborhoods may relate to stronger perceptions of gentrification. Across two studies, using both qualitative and quantitative methods, I evaluated what building features (e.g., newness of business, type of establishment) impacted perceptions of gentrification, then how those perceptions, as well as building features and participant characteristics, affected belonging. As people try to remedy the negative impacts of gentrification on marginalized communities, it is important to better understand what gentrification looks like, and who it impacts the most.",

          "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nObjectives   To assess the impact of spin on the interpretation of the results and conclusions reported in abstracts describing randomized controlled trials investigating behavioural treatments for depression. \nDesign   This study was an online parallel-group randomized controlled trial. \nParticipants   We recruited clinicians and clinical researchers by sending 6794 email invitations. We received 190 eligible responses of which 91 were randomized into the ‘without spin’-condition and 99 into the ‘with spin’-condition. \nInterventions   We selected 10 abstracts from published RCTs that investigated behavioural treatments for depression. The RCTs had at least one nonsignificant primary outcome and an abstract conclusion that claimed a beneficial effect despite that nonsignificant primary outcome. We rewrote the abstracts to create a spinless version of each of the 10 abstracts. Participants were randomly assigned to read one version of one of the 10 abstracts and answer questions about the study described in the abstract. \nOutcome measures   The primary outcome was the participants’ perception of the effectiveness of the treatment proposed in the abstract, rated on a scale from 0 to 10. \nResults   The Bayesian analysis showed no convincing support for an effect of spin on the participants’ perception of the treatment effectiveness (posterior mean = 0.53, SE = 0.27, 95% CI [-0.01, 1.07]; posterior mode = 0.54, 95% HDI [-0.02, 1.06]). However, following the Bayes factor of 1.8, no convincing support for a null-effect was found either.\nConclusion   The presence of spin in abstracts did not convincingly impact the perceptions of clinicians and clinical researchers regarding the effectiveness of the proposed treatment.",

          "abstract": "Empirical evidence shows that achievement motivation is related to academic outcomes\nlike performance. In the last decades, research followed a more dynamic approach to\nexplain such connections and has shifted from using stable traits to investigating\nmomentarily fluctuating states. Achievement motivation has been shown to 1) fluctuate at\nstate level and 2) be linked to specific situation perception variables, like Duty or Intellect,\nbut the direction of this relation is yet unclear. Being interested in whether situation\nperception has an effect on achievement motivation or vice versa, we obtained state selfreports\nof those variables from N = 248 students that participated in an online learning\ntask with three successive measurement occasions, including a quiz. Using random\nintercept cross-lagged panel models, we examined the directionality of the relation\nbetween situation perception and achievement motivation states. Cross-lagged parameters\nwere mainly substantial from situation perception to motivation. There were no significant\npaths for Intellect, but directional effects from Duty to achievement motivation states with\npositive valence. Findings of the study highlight the importance of Duty in shaping\nachievement motivation states, widening our understanding of the role of situational\ncontext in academic settings, and provide first insights into causal relations between these\nvariables.",

          "abstract": "Given the increasing reliance on batteries for everyday technology and large-scale energy solutions, particularly in climate change mitigation, understanding public perceptions of battery usage and storage is crucial. Using an experimental survey, the study examines the role of affect, trust in science, and risk/benefit perceptions in shaping public acceptance of batteries, both for personal use and as a climate change mitigation tool. Post-hoc tests, hierarchical regressions, and Free Word Association Tests were used in the analyses. Results indicate that positive affect and trust in science are key predictors of battery acceptance across both use cases. Importantly, acceptance did not differ by condition, and the experimental condition (household vs. climate) did not moderate the effect of ideology, suggesting that battery technologies may be perceived as inherently linked to environmental issues, regardless of how they are framed. The study highlights the need for targeted communication strategies that balance the promotion of battery technology with transparency about its risks to improve public understanding and support for battery innovations.",

Children’s language outcomes were measured via the McArthur-Bates CDI at age 2, and literacy tests in preschool and first grade. Analyses showed parents engaged more with girls than boys (standardized β=0.10 to 0.17), and this engagement partially mediated the relationship between sex and language outcomes (mediation 6% to 19%). These findings suggest that parental language input contributes to sex differences in language development, with implications for designing interventions that ensure equitable language opportunities for all children.",

          "abstract": "There is substantial concern that social media use (SMU) negatively impacts well-being. Building on the idea that subjective evaluations of SMU can shape well-being effects, this study examined how two social media mindsets—agency and valence—relate to self-reported and logged SMU, and four well-being indicators (depression, anxiety, stress, life satisfaction) among a sample of young adults (N = 1858, M = 21.01, SD = 3.14) in South Africa. The results replicate, extend and sometimes contradict previous findings in this regard. Agency mindsets (perceptions of control over SMU) negatively correlated with SMU and positively with well- being, while valence mindsets (perceptions about SMU effects) were associated with higher SMU but not to well-being. Logged SMU showed weaker associations with mindsets and well- being compared to self-reported SMU, suggesting differences between perceived and actual use. These findings highlight the importance of users' sense of control, more so than SMU duration or valence mindsets, in predicting well-being.",

          "abstract": "Typical late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) compromises episodic memory, the ability to recollect past events. Much of the research on episodic memory in AD has relied on lab-based memory tasks (e.g., word lists, short stories). It is unclear how well these tasks characterize the impact of episodic memory impairments across different domains of everyday life, including conversational memory. In this scoping review, we followed the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis and PRISMA-ScR guidelines to establish what is known about conversational memory in AD (e.g., “I remember discussing medical decisions with my children and I said [...] and they responded [...]”). We retained 121 reports on conversation and 3 reports on conversational memory out of the 8,351 unique records found on PubMed, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Web of Science, Cochrane, Embase, and in relevant reviews. Included reports had to involve conversation in any format and on any topic, include an AD population, be peer-reviewed, in English, and published between 1990–2022. None of the studies investigated memory for spontaneous conversation. Given the rarity of studies on conversational memory, we primarily summarized existing knowledge about conversation and methodological considerations to inspire hypotheses for future research on conversational memory in AD and to illuminate decisions regarding study design. Between 10%-85% studies reported on demographic characteristics, hearing/vision acuity, screening tests, task instructions, and the duration of the conversations. Studies described a broad range of behaviors during conversation, such as repetitions, dysfluency, ambiguity, pauses, and gestures. This review revealed a wide gap in knowledge on conversational memory in AD and offers a path to accelerating research on the topic. Conversational memory may be an important factor in promoting independence, participation in healthcare, and social well-being.",

          "abstract": "To maintain and develop close relationships, people need to accurately represent the minds of close others. Although studies have characterized the development of children’s theory of mind and children’s theory of relationships, it is largely unknown whether and how children think about mental state reasoning within close relationships. In three experiments, we asked whether children think of accurate mental state reasoning as a cue to social closeness. In Experiment 1 (n = 145), we found that 4- to 9-year-old children inferred that characters who are socially close know about each other’s goals and desires. In Experiment 2 (n = 137), we found that 6- to 9-year-old children, but not younger children, inferred that characters who are correct about each other’s minds are socially close. Children did not make the same inferences, however, concerning knowledge about external states of the world. In Experiment 3 (n = 79), we conceptually replicated the main findings from Experiments 1 and 2, and we found that 6- to 9-year-old children did not form the same inferences concerning knowledge about observable features of individuals (e.g., an individual’s outfit); children’s inferences were specific to unobservable mental content. Thus, by 6 years of age, children apply their theory of mind and their theory of relationships to make sense of whether and how people are connected to each other, as well as the strength and nature of those connections.",

          "abstract": "Humans learn adaptive behaviors via a durable but incremental reinforcement-learning (RL) system and a fast but fleeting working memory (WM) system. Past work parsing these systems focused on reward learning alone. Hence, little is known about how they interact while simultaneously learning to avoid punishment, and whether arbitrating between these demands is disrupted by psychiatric symptoms. We administered a novel reward/punishment RL-WM task to an online sample oversampled for depression and anxiety symptoms (N=298; n=275 after quality control). We found participants avoided punishment during initial learning, yet poorly retained this avoidance. Computational modeling captured this pattern by allowing the fleeting WM system to facilitate punishment avoidance, while the durable RL system retained little about punishment. We also found individual differences in a previously documented tendency for WM to blunt the RL system. Specifically, while we indeed found that a subset of high-blunting participants paradoxically showed the worst (RL-based) ultimate retention when WM had facilitated initial learning, another subset enjoyed the greatest ultimate retention in this scenario. Importantly, we found that the retention patterns in the task could not be captured by a computational model in which the RL system was replaced by a stimulus-response one. Finally, we found that task performance (analyzed behaviorally and via computational modeling) was largely spared as a function of depression/anxiety and trait rumination. Overall, our findings provide insight into how WM and RL interact when facing the ubiquitous challenge of attaining reward while simultaneously avoiding punishment, and demonstrate intact behavior under internalizing-disorder symptoms.",

          "abstract": "Inequity aversion is a fundamental social preference. Concern for others’ welfare is yet another fundamental social preference. What do people prefer when maximizing others’ welfare creates an inequality that disadvantages them? Prior research has shown that people’s preferences depend on their level of agency, that is, their control over the allocation. Behaviorally, agentic decision makers have been shown to be more likely to prefer allocations that give another person more than them, compared to non-agentic ones. However, the cognitive processes underlying this shift of preference remain unclear. Here, we used mouse-tracking and reaction times to investigate how agency shapes social preferences in such cases. We examined decision conflict, the level of conflict experienced in arriving at a given choice, as a way to uncover whether different underlying social preferences are at play when one has versus does not have agency. We predicted an interaction effect of agency and choice on conflict, where choosing the prosocial option would be associated with less conflict in the Agency condition compared to the No-Agency condition, and that the opposite would be true for the equitable option. In our task, on each of trial, participants were presented with two allocation options: an equitable option (e.g., 50 cents for self, 50 cents for other) and an inequitable and prosocial option, favoring the other participant over oneself (e.g., 50 cents for self, 70 cents for other). Agentic participants chose one option to be implemented, whereas non-agentic participants indicated their preference, knowing that the lab manager had already made the decision. In two studies (N = 586), including a preregistered one, an interaction effect emerged in both mouse trajectory and reaction time analyses. These results suggest that agency alters social preferences during the decision-making process, and challenge traditional inequity aversion models claiming that people inherently dislike inequitable outcomes. Granting agency may be a powerful tool for maximizing social welfare in situations where equity and prosocial behavior are at odds.",

The new idea could have any name, but some names for it are clearly better than others. This paper builds upon existing research on the perceived relationship between label and word meaning to better understand the way that label choice affects language design, particularly conceptual engineering. Across three experiments, the paper finds that when learning novel concepts, the labels serving as vehicles for the novel concepts affect how people perceive the novel concepts’ content. In particular, the experiments find that labels influence people’s perception of novel concepts’ valence. Not all forms of information are readily extracted from labels, however, and subtle forms of information, particularly phonesthemes, do not appear to be noticed by people learning new concepts. Accordingly, conceptual engineers and other forms of language designers need to do careful research into how a given label will affect how their novel concept is interpreted by others.",

Qualitative interviews with 13 participants who believed they had gotten better revealed clinically relevant findings. We review two domains: (1) the perceived outcomes of therapy and (2) the clients’ own explanations of the discrepancy. Participants reported increased insight and self-awareness, learning coping strategies, interpersonal improvements, symptom reduction, increased resilience, moralization and motivation, and improved self-concept. They explained the discrepancy between the OQ-45 and their subjective report by citing extratherapeutic factors, changes in how they interacted with the questionnaire, elements of progress not detected by the questionnaire (e.g., increased capacity for adversity), and hindsight bias.

          "abstract": "This study examined how mother-preschooler and father-preschooler dyads differed in dynamic physiological self-regulation and time-lagged coregulation when transitioning from play to a challenging disciplinary context, and how these individual and dyadic regulatory processes varied by parenting risk. Participants included 78 mother-preschooler and 51 father-preschooler dyads (53% female, 63.3% non-Hispanic White) oversampled for familial risk. At 2½ years, parents self-reported harsh parenting. At 3 years, parent-child RSA was collected during free play and clean-up tasks. Multilevel models of time-lagged RSA (i.e., parent RSA predicting child RSA in the next time unit and vice versa) were conducted. In response to a task with increased challenge and parenting demands, mothers and children showed expected individual RSA decreases (indicating active regulation) whereas fathers showed increases in RSA (indicating disengagement). During play, mother-driven negative time-lagged RSA coregulation and father-driven positive time-lagged RSA coregulation were observed, but this disappeared during challenge. Harsh parenting was associated with altered RSA responses to challenge: during clean-up, harsher mothers showed a lack of engagement in regulatory processes, harsher fathers showed more stability in RSA self-regulation during the task, and child-driven negative RSA coregulation with harsher fathers was observed. Findings suggest that during preschool: (1) parents are the typical drivers of RSA coregulation; (2) challenging contexts and parenting risk alter dynamic RSA self-regulation and time-lagged RSA coregulation; and (3) typical and atypical RSA self-regulation and time-lagged coregulation differ between mother-child and father-child dyads.",

Multi-option decisions are also important from a theoretical perspective. Experimental and computational studies have demonstrated that the composition of a set of choice options has predictable effects on choice outcomes. Specifically, with more options available to choose from, responses are slower and more stochastic. This effect is amplified when the values of the options (including the worst option in the set) are more similar to each other. In this study, we provide additional evidence of these effects. We also provide evidence that metacognitive factors such as feelings of confidence in the response or mental effort exertion during deliberation show similar effects as the cognitive factors (consistency between choices and value estimates, and response speed). Finally, we provide novel evidence that value estimates are refined during deliberation for all options in choice triplets, similar to what has previously been show for choice pairs.",

Following the skill-learning (task-specificity) hypothesis, we expected that language switching may be automatized and no longer rely on EFs in bilinguals with high language proficiency, but not for those with lower proficiency. Thus, we expected significant associations between the tasks in the lower proficiency participants only. Our results showed no CN switching-EF associations in the more experienced L2 speakers, but a significant association in lower-proficiency participants. This suggests that language switching engages EFs only in participants with lower proficiency in whom these processes are not yet automatized.",

          "abstract": "Protestors recently repurposed the abortion rights’ mantra, “my body, my choice,” to oppose COVID-19 mandates. But do those who oppose public health mandates fully support the right to choose? We answer this question by using exploratory analyses to identify the unique response patterns underlying support for abortion and COVID-19 mandates in random samples from the United States (Study 1; N = 2,331) and New Zealand (Study 2; N = 33,310). Latent profile analyses revealed a small subgroup in both countries (12.6% and 3.4% of the respective samples) who opposed mandates. Yet contrary to the “my body, my choice” rhetoric seen at anti-mandate protests, they also opposed abortion. Across both studies, those in the Anti-Mandate profile tended to be more religious, conservative, and distrustful of institutions. In Study 2, they were also low on cognitive consistency and high on conspiracy belief. Finally, the Anti-Mandate profile was opposed to free speech critical of both the United States and religion (Study 1), high on sexual prejudice (both studies), unsupportive of progressive protests (but supportive of reactionary protests; Study 2), and likely to vote for conservative parties (both studies). These results reveal the mobilization potential of the anti-mandate movement, uncover important contradictions within its members, and illustrate the nuanced ways in which opposition to gender policies (i.e., reproductive rights) coalesce with reactionary protests.",

          "abstract": "Music's rhythmic structure and emotional content can influence how attention is allocated. While much of the existing research has focused on music's ability to enhance attentional performance through behavioral tasks, our study aims to expand this knowledge by investigating how music affects the temporal dynamics of attention using eye-tracking. Fifty-seven middle-aged and older adults listened to music characterized as happy or sad music, or silence for 10 minutes before and after completing the Attention Network Test (ANT). Attention was indexed using blink probabilities. We hypothesized that happy and sad music would differentially influence blinking dynamics during music listening and during completion of the ANT. The probability of a blink fluctuated, non-linearly, during happy and sad music listening, but not during silence listening. Notably, participants in the happy music group inhibited blinking when the flanker task was preceded by temporally or spatially uninformative cues, whereas sad music and silence did not affect blinking before the flanker task onset. Blinking also predicted faster response times in the happy music group and slower response times in the sad music group. Overall, our results demonstrate that music listening modulates the temporal dynamics of attention, highlighting its potential to serve as a therapeutic tool for enhancing attentional performance, particularly in older adults where attentional decline is common.",

One promising alternative is a vocal articulation task, which provides a measure of speeded performance that is independent of fine-motor coordination. The current study applies an ex-Gaussian decomposition to preparatory interval (the time to initiate a vocal response) and speech rate on a speeded articulation task among children with and without ADHD. Although differences in mean vocal response time were not found, there was substantial evidence that the tail of the distribution, as indexed by the tau parameter (which is linked to the rate of information accumulation), was larger in children with ADHD. Variance in tau was also greater among children with ADHD, and the greater variance was not fully explained by individual differences in working memory capacity. Results highlight the importance of adopting analytic methods that can more accurately describe performance.",

          "abstract": "Background: Recent advances in digital mental health have paved the way for more personalized mobile health (mHealth) interventions by leveraging intensive longitudinal ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data. Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMIs) facilitate reach of individuals in a given moment and context, in their daily living environments, which can, in turn, lower barriers to public mental health services. The use of advanced Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, generative Recurrent Neural Networks in particular, may augment effects of EMIs on mental health outcomes by improving the process of tailoring EMI components to individual preferences, needs, and contexts. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility, safety, and effects of a novel ML-based, adaptive EMI – the AI4U training - for personalized mental health promotion in youth. \n\nMethods: A within-subject micro-randomized trial (MRT) was conducted to investigate effects of EMI components on time-lagged proximal mental health outcomes in daily life. Participants were repeatedly randomized to one of two conditions up to seven times per day over a 30-day period with equal probability (i.e., up to 210 decision points for each individual): the experimental condition, receiving an EMI component based on a personalized ML-algorithm, or the active control condition, receiving an EMI component randomly. First, the feasibility and safety of delivering the AI4U training for mental health promotion in youth were evaluated. Second, the effects of ML-based vs. random assignment of EMI components on time-lagged proximal outcomes (i.e., positive affect, momentary resilience, negative affect) at tn+1 were examined. Third, uncontrolled effects of the AI4U training on distal outcomes (i.e., psychological distress, resilience, emotion regulation) at post-intervention were investigated. The AI4U training consists of eight EMI components on positive imagery, breathing techniques, and positive refocusing as well as a dedicated web-based dashboard for real-time self-monitoring of mental health outcomes and behaviours.\n\nResults: A total of 83 individuals aged 14–25 were identified from the general population and psychological counselling. Of these, 58 met eligibility criteria and provided informed consent, with 57 (98.2%) completing the AI4U training and post-intervention assessment. There was evidence on feasibility of the AI4U training overall, including high ratings of satisfaction, acceptability, and usability. No serious adverse events were observed. Beneficial effects of ML-based vs. randomized assignment of EMI components were evident for momentary resilience when the experimental and active control condition were compared (marginal excursion effect, B = 0.147, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.004 – 0.290, p-value: 0.044). However, there was no evidence of beneficial effects of ML-based intervention assignment on momentary positive affect (B = 0.012, 95% CI, -0.012-0.128, p-value: 0.839) and negative affect (B = 0.093, 95% CI, -0.020-0.206, p-value: 0.103), respectively. Uncontrolled effects of the AI4U training on distal outcomes indicated reduced psychological distress (Cohen’s d: -0.25) along with improved resilience (Cohen’s d = 0.32) and use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies (Cohen’s d = 0.30).\n\nDiscussion: This study provides new evidence on feasibility, safety, and beneficial effects of a novel data-driven and ML-based, adaptive EMI for personalized mental health promotion in youth. A confirmatory trial is now warranted.",

Surprisingly, little evidence has been found for similarity in personality—one of the most fundamental psychological constructs. We argue that the lack of evidence for personality similarity stems from the tendency of individuals to make personality judgments relative to a salient comparison group, rather than in absolute terms (i.e., the reference-group effect), when responding to the self-report and peer-report questionnaires commonly used in personality research. We employed two behavior-based personality measures to circumvent the reference group effect. The results based on large samples provide evidence for personality similarity between romantic partners (n = 1,101; rs = .20–.47) and between friends (n = 46,483; rs = .12–.31).

          "abstract": "Purpose: People with aphasia (PWA) with cognitive deficits have poorer treatment outcomes than those without. Yet, aphasia therapy rarely targets cognition, which may contribute to the continued variability observed in aphasia treatment outcomes. Listening to music has been shown to positively impact cognition in neurotypical adults. The purpose of this study was to extend this large body of research into PWA by investigating whether listening to music improves attention in PWA.\nMethod: Forty-three PWA were assigned to listen to music characterized as happy (major mode, fast tempo) or sad (minor mode, slow tempo), or no music for 10 minutes. Attention was measured before and after music listening using the Attention Network Task, which measures three types of attention: alerting, orienting, and executive control. Mixed ANOVAs were used to explore how each type of attention changed after music listening by group and aphasia severity.\nResults: Our results demonstrate that listening to happy music improved orienting attention, regardless of aphasia severity. Happy music listening also improved alerting attention for individuals with moderate-severe aphasia. Executive control attention was not modulated by music listening. \nConclusions: Our findings suggest that music listening has the potential to improve attention in PWA. While we recommend further research in this area to better understand the extent and underlying mechanisms of music-induced changes in attention, SLPs may want to consider incorporating music listening into their treatment of PWA.",

          "authors": "Justin Fleming; Matthew Winn",
          "abstract": "Objectives: Seeing a talker’s mouth improves speech intelligibility, particularly for listeners who use cochlear implants (CIs). However, the impacts of visual cues on listening effort for listeners with CIs remain poorly understood, as previous studies have focused on listeners with typical hearing (TH) and featured stimuli that do not invoke effortful cognitive speech perception challenges. This study directly compared the effort of perceiving audiovisual speech between listeners who use CIs and those with TH. Visual cues were hypothesized to yield more relief from listening effort in a cognitively challenging speech perception condition that required listeners to mentally repair a missing word in the auditory stimulus. Eye gaze was simultaneously measured to examine whether the tendency to look toward a talker’s mouth would increase during these moments of uncertainty about the speech stimulus. \n\nDesign: Participants included listeners with CIs and an age-matched group of participants with typical age-adjusted hearing (N = 20 in both groups). The magnitude and time course of listening effort was evaluated using pupillometry. In half of the blocks, phonetic visual cues were removed by selectively blurring the talker’s mouth, which preserved stimulus luminance so visual conditions could be compared using pupillometry. Each block included a mixture of trials in which the sentence audio was intact, and trials in which a target word in the auditory stimulus was replaced by noise; the latter required participants to mentally reconstruct the target word upon repeating the sentence. Pupil and gaze data were analyzed using generalized additive mixed effects models (GAMMs) to identify the stretches of time during which effort or gaze strategy differed between conditions.\n\nResults: Visual release from effort was greater and lasted longer for listeners with CIs compared to those with TH. Within the CI group, visual cues reduced effort to a greater extent when a missing word needed to be repaired than when the speech was intact. Seeing the talker’s mouth also improved speech intelligibility for listeners with CIs, including reducing the number of incoherent verbal responses when repair was required. The two hearing groups deployed different gaze strategies when perceiving audiovisual speech. CI listeners looked more at the mouth overall, even when it was blurred, while TH listeners tended to increase looks to the mouth in the moment following a missing word in the auditory stimulus. \n\nConclusions: Integrating visual cues from a talker’s mouth not only improves speech intelligibility, but also reduces listening effort, particularly for listeners with CIs. For listeners with CIs (but not those with TH), these visual benefits are magnified when a missed word needs to be mentally corrected — a common occurrence during everyday speech perception for individuals with hearing loss. These results underscore the importance of including participants with hearing loss in listening effort studies and suggest caution in assuming results from TH listeners will generalize to those with hearing loss. They also highlight the potential clinical relevance of visual speech information, for counseling patients and families and potentially for the development of audiovisual strategies to reduce listening effort.",

This goes against the best interest and rights of youth, their caregivers, and society at large. In this commentary, we propose a hybrid research ethics strategy, which may help to strike a better balance between meeting ethical responsibilities (protecting minors from involuntary or unconsented participation) and safeguarding research quality and youth’s right to autonomous decisionmaking. This strategy allows the use of active, informed consent from caregivers where needed, and ‘passive’ (opt-out) consent in cases where youth can make autonomous and well-informed decisions to participate in research.",

          "abstract": "Introduction. Being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness (LTI) is often accompanied by feelings of fear, uncertainty, and loneliness that can severely impact mental health. Relatively few interventions are available to address the existential concerns of individuals facing LTI, while treatment of the underlying physical ailment typically remains the priority of the healthcare system. Research has shown that psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy (PAT) holds promise for supporting mental health in people with LTIs. However, PAT’s potential in this population remains curtailed by several limitations, including regulatory and accessibility issues. Novel approaches that could provide some of the benefits of psychedelic experiences, while avoiding associated challenges, would therefore be highly desirable for supporting the mental well-being of people with LTIs. Among such interventions, VR-based experiences have been suggested as a promising candidate. We here evaluate a program that includes weakly representational, multi-user VR experiences based on a design aesthetic previously described as “numadelic”, which has been demonstrated to elicit self-transcendent experiences comparable to psychedelics.\nMethods. A prospective cohort study design was used to assess the effects of “Clear Light” (CL) a group-based, 6-session multimedia program that included VR experiences, video calls, and text chats spanning 3 weeks. Participants were individuals suffering from LTIs that self-selected to participate in the CL program. A total of N=15 participants were evaluated based on assessments one week before and after the program, using self-report measures of anxiety, depression, well-being, and secondary psychological outcomes. \nResults. The intervention was well-tolerated among participants. Significant improvements with moderate effect sizes were observed on self-reported measures of anxiety, depression, and well-being. Secondary measures assessing demoralization, connectedness, and spiritual well-being also showed significant improvements. \nDiscussion. This observational study demonstrated the feasibility and potential benefits of a group-based VR program that can be delivered at-home to people suffering from LTIs. While conclusions are presently limited by the lack of randomization or a comparison group, our findings strongly suggest further research is warranted, including randomized controlled trials.",

          "abstract": "Causal inference with observational studies is challenging because the identification and estimation of a causal effect rests on the untestable unconfoundedness assumption. The assumption requires researchers to determine a set of observed covariates which then successfully removes all the confounding bias. Causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) provide (automatized) guidance for selecting an adjustment set of covariates. However, before one can select the covariates a valid causal DAG about the presumed data-generating process of the data in hand must be drawn. But published guidance on how to draw a valid causal DAG is at best still incomplete. This article introduces and discusses a stepwise procedure for drawing DAGs for causal inference.",

          "abstract": "Reward processes can reinforce extinction learning and aide cognitive processes involved with inhibitory learning. Anhedonia, characterized by deficits in reward incentivization, hedonic response, and learning, may therefore predict worse treatment outcomes. However, there are few existing studies of reward processes or anhedonia in predicting exposure-based treatment outcomes, and results are mixed. The current study examined associations between pretreatment self-reported anhedonia and several measures of anxiety symptom severity and treatment outcomes among patients who sought exposure-based treatment. Consistent with hypotheses, pretreatment anhedonia severity was associated with higher pretreatment anxiety symptom severity across a wide range of measures. However, inconsistent with hypotheses, higher anhedonia scores were associated with greater symptom improvement across treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. Additionally, anhedonia was not significantly associated with disorder-general measures of treatment outcomes, or disorder-specific treatment outcomes for generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, or post-traumatic anxiety disorder. Thus, pretreatment anhedonia is not an obstacle for beginning exposure therapy for anxiety disorders. More broadly, results highlight challenges in translating laboratory research to naturalistic clinical settings and the need for intensive longitudinal studies that can assess the role of reward processes in exposure therapy systematically across treatment.",

          "authors": "Jovan T Kemp; Dhanraj Vishwanath; Fulvio Domini",
          "abstract": "A major focus of research in sensory perception is the nature and source of errors in perceptual judgements. A dominant assumption in the field, originating in work on 3D perception, is that the variability in perceptual judgements measured by discrimination thresholds is due to sensory uncertainty (random error in the internal sensory estimate), and that cue integration acts to minimise this sensory uncertainty. In three experiments, we use a simple modification to the standard forced-choice paradigm in a sensory discrimination task to show that, contrary to the widespread assumption, variability in 3D perceptual discrimination tasks is determined by sensory bias (systematic error in the sensory estimate) and late-stage task-related uncertainty (random error in processes following the sensory estimate), rather than early-stage sensory uncertainty. Experiment 1 examined depth discrimination for 3D stimuli specified by low- and high-quality texture cues, where the fixed standard and variable comparison stimuli could be specified by either the same or different texture cues. Experiment 2 followed the same procedure for both disparity alone and a combination of texture and disparity. Experiment 3 tested this same discrimination task for motion or disparity while also measuring the perceptual function for each cue. In all experiments, we found that discrimination thresholds were best explained by the combination of sensory bias and task-related uncertainty, and—critically—not by sensory uncertainty. Our results bring into question the role of sensory uncertainty in perceptual error, and, in turn, what characterizes optimal cue integration.",

Some studies have shown how eye movement alterations can be associated with MS, but there are significant differences in methodology between the available studies. \nInclusion criteria: Studies that fulfil the following criteria regarding the participants, concept, and context framework will be included:  recruitment of MS patient over 18 years of age, any eye-tracking paradigm, any context. No restrictions on study design, publication type, or data will be applied at the very beginning of the literature search.\nMethods: This scoping review will be performed in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. The PubMed, Cochrane Central, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases will be searched up to October 2024. Additional papers will be detected by searching the grey literature and reference lists of all pertinent studies included in the review. The decision to include or exclude studies will be made by two reviewers working independently. The reviewers will undertake a thorough examination of all titles, abstracts, and full-text studies. The research team will endeavour to extract the characteristics of the included studies through a data collection form that has been created for this purpose.

Our findings reveal that even at this early age, children’s drawings indicate an accurate differentiation of several functions, including linear and non-linear ones, and an understanding of linearity and curvature. Furthermore, both age groups displayed intuitions of compositionality by distinguishing, for example, sinusoid functions with an increasing amplitude from those with a decreasing or a constant one. All children had difficulties with more complex patterns, such as those involving changes in both amplitude and frequency, as in stair-like patterns.

          "authors": "Aidan G.C. Wright; Florian Scharf; Johannes Zimmermann",
          "abstract": "Ambulatory assessment is widely popular in research settings for its ability to assess real world functioning in context. It can be useful for estimating an individual’s typical level of a behavior (individual mean), how (un)stable that behavior is (individual standard deviation), how behaviors associate with others or specific contexts (within-person correlation), and shifts in those statistics that might signal an important change in functioning (e.g., early warning signal). However, to date many of the methodological advances have not made the jump from the lab to diagnostic practice. Effective use of ambulatory assessment in applied settings to understand functioning and guide potential interventions requires development and application of psychometric standards for N=1 assessments (Wright &amp; Zimmermann, 2019). We conducted a simulation study to determine how many assessments are necessary to achieve sufficiently reliable (i.e., precise and stable) estimates of an individual’s mean and standard deviation on a single variable as well as the correlation between two variables. To ensure the ecological validity of the simulation conditions, we used real time series data from a large sample that included patients and non-patients (capturing realistic levels of autocorrelation and skewness). We found that the minimum number of assessments highly depends on the statistic of interest and the temporal characteristics of the variable of interest. Individual means can be estimated reliably with a reasonably small number of observations under most conditions, but adequately precise and stable individual correlations require more assessments than may be achievable in many applied settings. We discuss the implications of these results for the potential of applied ambulatory assessment in diagnostic practice.",

For each task, we report: (1) specific pattern-based (as opposed to coordinate-based) anatomical details essential for distinguishing MD from other BOLD-based cognitive modes, and (2) task-induced BOLD signal changes associated with MD over a range of task conditions. In order to facilitate recognition, we nick-named the anatomical patterns specific to MD as follows: (1) Jumping Jack Flash, (2) Ape Nostrils, (3) Flexing Hands, and (4) Wipe Your Mouth Bear Triple Jam. Evidence for MD was derived from the timing and magnitude of task-induced BOLD signal changes induced by the following tasks: autobiographical event simulation, evidence integration, probabilistic reasoning, Raven’s standard progressive matrices, and social cognition. Based on observation of task-induced BOLD signal changes across these tasks, MD function could fit the original definition of attentional resources to individual parts of a complex task, but it was also noted that many other cognitive modes were general to many tasks, MD was not present in all tasks and in fact was not as commonly observed as other modes, and MD could even show deactivation under task conditions requiring for internal attention.",

          "abstract": "The Early Learning and Development Standard (ELDS) Assessment Tool is a valuable tool to measure early childhood development (ECD) outcomes for large-scale monitoring and evaluation purposes in Nepal. However, its potential impacts on policymaking have been limited by practical challenges derived from its time-consuming nature, which hindered efficient data collection at scale. The purpose of this study is to improve the efficiency of the tool by utilizing a multidimensional framework proposed by Seiden (2024). We analyzed a unique dataset collected in Nepal and selected a set of items that optimizes the balance between reliability (statistical), content relevance and representativeness (conceptual), and administrative efficiency (practical) dimensions of the tool. We compared the efficient form suggested by the multidimensional framework with a conventional approach that relied solely on the statistical dimension and discussed the implications of the results. Our findings highlight the importance of considering multiple dimensions when selecting items for an assessment tool, as the conventional approach may not necessarily select the most appropriate items. This study's results can inform the development of efficient ECD measurement and improve policymaking decisions based on high-quality evidence generated from precise and efficient measurements.",

Research demonstrates that stressors, such as exposure to early-life adversity (ELA), is associated with both agency beliefs and learning, but how these processes interact remains unclear. The current study investigated whether exposure to ELA influences agency and interacts with reinforcement learning in adults. Replicating prior behavioral and computational work, ELA resulted in decreased learning, while increased adversity severity was associated with decreased latent agency beliefs. These findings suggest that exposure to adversity in childhood has a nuanced impact on reinforcement learning and agency beliefs in adulthood.",

          "abstract": "Childhood maltreatment (CM) increases the risk of psychopathology. Besides CM types and severity, the timing of exposure is an important modulating factor in this association, as childhood and adolescence comprise sensitive developmental periods for brain maturation and socio-emotional development. Nevertheless, previously reported associations between the severity of subtypes and timing of CM and psychopathology have been heterogeneous and have hardly considered vulnerable groups broadly exposed to CM, such as out-of-home-placed youth. Thus, we investigated the association between CM types and timing and psychopathology in a sample of formerly out-of-home placed young adults (N = 185; 32% women, age mean = 26.38, SD = 3.49 years). CM was assessed using the Maltreatment of Abuse Chronology of Exposure Scale and general, internalizing and, externalizing problems were assessed using the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment. We employed conditional random forest regression to estimate the importance of CM types (abuse, neglect, peer victimization, and sexual abuse), timings (ages 3–18) as well as CM severity, multiplicity, and duration on adult general, internalizing, and externalizing problems. We validated the results using diagnoses of mental disorders assessed in clinical interviews, which were classified under general, internalizing, and externalizing clusters based on the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology model. We found that CM severity and multiplicity were stronger predictors of internalizing problems than timing-specific effects of CM types. Abuse in early childhood and peer violence in late adolescence were stronger predictors of externalizing problems compared to global CM measures. Our findings highlight the importance of considering CM type and timing when testing CM-associated risks for psychopathology. This might further be valuable in therapeutic settings to guide maltreatment-informed interventions. Reducing violent caregiving environments in early childhood and preventing peer victimization in adolescence may be especially important in counteracting CM-associated risks of externalizing behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Background: Large reductions to meal portion size result in reduced daily energy intake due to reductions not being fully compensated for through later energy intake. However, to date no studies have investigated how more realistic portion size reductions affect energy intake. The present study investigated whether reducing the portion size of a meal by 15% affects subsequent energy intake and if this effect differs depending on whether or not consumers are aware of the portion size reduction. \n\nMethods: Participants (N = 110, female = 58) attended two test days where they were given ad libitum access to a lunch meal (main course and desserts) and a dinner meal (main course and desserts). During the first day, participants’ intake of the lunch main course was recorded and during the second day, participants were served a lunch main course either the portion size of the amount they consumed on the first day (control condition), or 15% less. Participants served 15% less were either told that the portion size was the amount they previously consumed (reduced unaware) or it had been reduced (reduced aware).\n\nResults: Compared with the first test day, participants in the second test day in both of the reduced portion size conditions consumed less energy from the lunch main course than the control condition. There were no significant effects of condition on energy intake immediately after the lunch main course or energy intake later in the day, indicating a lack of evidence for compensatory eating in response to reduced portion size.  However, exploratory analyses were suggestive of participants in the reduced aware condition showing some degree of compensatory eating.\n\nConclusion: These findings suggest that reducing meal portion size by 15% decreases meal energy intake and may not cause significant later compensatory eating. However, further research is required to understand the size of portion reductions to promote reduced daily energy intake and if this is affected by awareness of portion size reductions.",

Previous research fails to pinpoint effect of Alzheimer’s progression collectively on the three variables and has inconsistencies in results relative to changes in anatomical volumes and cortical thinning as well as scanner effect dilemma.\nMethods Longitudinal data were analysed from participants in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD; N = 941), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; N = 1545), and cognitively normal (CN; N = 925) participants. MRI imaging and cognitive assessment data were utilized. Images were segmented using the LOD Brain model, and a multiple regression model was employed to investigate the impact of Alzheimer’s progression and aging on various brain structure volumes and cortical thickness.\nResults The results indicate progression of the illness resulted in a significant decrease in brain structure volumes across grey and white matter, brain stem, basal ganglia and cerebellum with the exception of an increase in ventricles as well as an increase in cortical thinning in entorhinal cortex temporal, parietal cortices alongside cerebrum. Cognitive decline is correlated with a loss in total brain volume and more specifically grey matter, cerebellum and basal ganglia amplified by Alzheimer’s progression.\nConclusions Our results highlight how important it is to conduct research integrating cortical thickness, brain volume and cognitive decline in order to enhance our understanding of the disease’s progression.",

          "abstract": "The latest DSM-5-TR revision included independent diagnostic codes for Suicidal and Non-Suicidal Self-Injurious Behavior (SIB), emphasizing the need to differentiate subtypes. However, research on individuals who have experienced both Suicidal and Non-Suicidal SIB remains limited. This lack of understanding may hinder the recognition of a distinct subgroup within the SIB population, making it difficult to identify their unique characteristics. This study utilized the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) to investigate risk decision-making patterns across four groups: Major Depressive Disorder patients with history of Suicidal SIB (MDD-SA), Non-Suicidal (MDD-NSSI), both types of SIB (MDD-Both), and a Healthy Control group (HC). Our findings revealed distinct risk-decision-making patterns in the learning curve of Cash RT. This potentially indicated features of indecisive decision-making. These pieces of evidence may significantly benefit both research and clinical communities. First, time-dimensional indices, particularly Cash RT in BART, appear to be promising discriminative markers. Additionally, at the clinical level, the distinct risk decision-making patterns observed align with the new DSM-5-TR diagnostic framework. Importantly, our findings suggest that individuals with history of combined type of SIB may be considered as an independent subgroup deserving focused attention. Future studies may elucidate the underlying mechanisms of these risk decision-making pattern differences. \n\nKeywords: Suicide, Suicide Attempt, Non-Suicidal Self-Injury, Major Depressive Disorder, Risk Decision-making, Balloon Analogue Risk Task",

In this paper we reflect on the strengths and limitations of the traditional developmental perspective. We suggest that behavioral, cognitive, and emotional development are better understood as a process of bricolage (construction within constraints). This perspective is illustrated in an analysis of change mechanisms, and behavioral and representational changes, in attachment development from pre-locomotor infancy to later adulthood. Special emphasis is placed on ordinary learning and cognitive processes, rather than those specific to attachment, and on the\nroles that socialization pressures and changing circumstances play in shaping the course of attachment development.",

However, there remains an important need for detailed experimental data regarding how mindfulness training alters the brain and how such changes translate to influence psychological function and subjective experience. The Intensive Longitudinal Mindfulness (ILM) study addresses this gap in the literature, by providing a fully within subject, time-intensive EEG sampling of mindfulness practice.  The focus of this paper is to provide the protocol for the ILM study as a resource for interested researchers. Across eight weeks of mindfulness training, participants completed up to 24 EEG recorded sessions (3x per week) of focused attention (FA) and open monitoring (OM), two theoretically distinct forms of mindfulness practice, using standardized audio-guided meditation practices. Following each 20-minute practice of FA and OM (totaling 40 minutes per training session), subjective meditation quality was assessed using a self-report questionnaire battery. Before and after the eight weeks of training, participants also completed a multi-session task battery to assess training related changes to cognitive and affective functioning.  The ILM study aims to demonstrate the value of a well-controlled, within-subject time intensive longitudinal design, with the capability to track neural and self-report trajectories associated with different forms of mindfulness training and to link these important dimensions of analysis across time.",

          "abstract": "Stimulus manipulations in perceptual decision-making tasks can be categorized into two broad categories: manipulating the quality of the sensory input (stimulus reliability) and manipulating the distance between the sensory feature of interest and the decision boundary (boundary distance). However, despite the fundamental difference between these two manipulations, it remains controversial whether they lead to dissociable behavioral effects. Here, we demonstrate the existence of robust dissociation between the effect of stimulus reliability and boundary distance on confidence and accuracy. Subjects indicated the orientation of a Gabor patch relative to a decision boundary set at 45. We manipulated the stimulus reliability and boundary distance by varying the contrast and the offset from 45, respectively. We found that, as compared to stimulus reliability, the boundary distance manipulation had larger effect on accuracy but smaller effect on confidence. Further, confidence decreased with difficulty for error trials in the boundary distance manipulation (a pattern known as “folded-X pattern”) but not in the stimulus reliability manipulation (i.e., a violation of the folded-X pattern). Both of these effects were replicated in a second experiment with dot motion. These results demonstrate that manipulations of stimulus reliability and boundary distance have dissociable effects on accuracy and confidence, suggesting that the mapping between confidence and accuracy depends on the specifics of how difficulty is manipulated.",

Although weight suppression has been found to be a predictor of weight gain in persons with BN, research about the nature of weight changes during treatment and other predictors thereof is scarce.\nMethod: The current study examined weight suppression as well as self-reported bingeing severity and purging frequency at admission as predictors of weight change during inpatient treatment in 746 persons with BN (95% female).\nResults: Body mass index (BMI) increased linearly across treatment weeks. Higher weight suppression predicted larger weight gain, particularly in those with a relatively low BMI at admission. More frequent purging and less severe bingeing predicted larger weight gain but high bingeing severity in combination with infrequent purging attenuated this effect.\nConclusions: Results replicate that those with high weight suppression are at higher risk for gaining weight during BN treatment but extend these findings in that this effect additionally depends on current BMI, similar to findings reported in persons with anorexia nervosa. They further demonstrate that the core features of BN—bingeing and purging—also predict weight change both separately and interactively and may, therefore, be considered in psychoeducation and therapy planning.",

          "abstract": "The prevalence of religious beliefs and practices is puzzling from evolutionary viewpoint, but previous research suggested that religious traditions provide health and cooperative benefits. Seemingly in contrast with this claim are worldwide secularization trends where people disaffiliate from religions and belief in god(s). Previous theories suggested that diminished exogenous pressures no longer motivate individuals to seek religious benefits and pay the participation costs. We investigate this causal claim using National Study of Youth and Religion dataset, which tracks the development of religiosity among US Christians from adolescence to young adulthood (n = 3 370). Using a general lagged panel methodology, we found that material security in Wave 1 (early adolescence) predicts higher probability of decrease in belief in God in Wave 4 (young adulthood). This result provides support for the hypothesis that participation in religious traditions is associated with living in insecure socio-ecology, where the systems may still confer benefits onto their members. We also examined specific exogenous pressures related to health and trust, but these additional analyses revealed mixed results.  We conclude with a call for further research using more nuanced measures and larger sample sizes that may provide further insights into the adaptive nature of cultural systems.",

          "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cognitive change is a complex phenomenon encompassing both retest-related performance gains and potential cognitive decline.  Disentangling these dynamics is necessary for effective tracking of subtle cognitive change and risk factors for ADRD. \n\nMETHODS: We applied a computational cognitive model of learning and forgetting to data from Einstein Aging Study (n = 316). EAS participants completed multiple bursts of ultra-brief, high-frequency cognitive assessments on smartphones. Analyzing response time data, we extracted several key cognitive markers: short-term intraindividual variability in performance, within-burst retest learning and asymptotic (peak) performance, across-burst change in asymptote and forgetting of retest gains.  \n\nRESULTS: Asymptotic performance was related to both MCI and age, and there was evidence of asymptotic slowing over time. Long-term forgetting, learning rate, and within-person variability uniquely signified MCI, irrespective of age. \n\nDISCUSSION: Computational cognitive markers hold promise as sensitive and specific indicators of preclinical cognitive change, aiding risk identification and targeted interventions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Children are highly sensitive to adversity during their first five years of life, with exposure to chronic parental mental illness (MI) consistently linked to socio-emotional impairments and mental health problems in children. Children born during the COVID-19 pandemic were exposed to unprecedented levels of parental distress, with parental MI reported at three times the pre-pandemic rates. This situation underscored a pressing need for scalable solutions to foster positive mental health and developmental outcomes for a generation of children. In response, we developed the Building Emotional Awareness and Mental Health (BEAM) program, an innovative mobile health (mHealth) solution for parents of young children. Clinical trials to date evaluating BEAM have shown promising results, demonstrating reductions in parent depression, suicidality, anxiety, and harsh parenting practices. This trial involves an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design with co-primary aims of (1) determining BEAM’s effectiveness in improving parent mental health, and (2) evaluating the implementation of BEAM in the community through metrics such as feasibility, acceptability, and uptake. This trial’s secondary aim is to measure BEAM’s effectiveness in improving short-term child mental health and developmental outcomes using primary data and long-term psychosocial family outcomes using administrative data. A final exploratory aim of this trial will measure the cost-utility of delivering BEAM relative to extant health programming.\nMethods: A single arm trial with repeated measures will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of implementing the BEAM intervention in the community with a sample of 400 parent participants with a child aged 24-71 months. Participants must self-report moderate to severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, parenting stress, and/or anger at time of enrolment (T0) and live in the province of Manitoba, Canada. Individuals will be recruited through four streams including the (1) Manitoba Crisis Response Services, (2) primary care offices (paediatricians and/or general practitioners), (3) Manitoba family community organizations and child care centres, and (4) social media. Study participants will complete 12 weeks of psychoeducation modules, with access to an online social support forum and check ins with a peer coach. Assessments of parent and child mental health symptoms will occur at pre-test before BEAM begins (T1), immediately after the last week of the BEAM intervention (post-test, T2), 6-month follow-up (T3), and 12-month follow-up (T4). \nDiscussion: The BEAM program offers a promising solution to address elevated parental mental health symptoms, parenting stress, and related child functioning concerns. The present implementation trial aims to extend the groundwork established by an open pilot trial and RCT of the BEAM program, in a next step of testing BEAM’s readiness for nationwide scaling. \nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06455397.

          "abstract": "Memory precision varies along the hippocampal long axis in the mature brain. Yet, little is known about how developmental change in long-axis functionality influences this precision. We characterized how children and adults engage the hippocampal long axis to form precise memories. Children (7-9 years) and adults performed two tasks that encouraged an orientation to the specific details versus broader category of scenes during encoding. They then performed a recognition test with studied scenes and similar lures. Adults had more precise memories than children, in that they were better able to discriminate studied scenes from lures; yet, both age groups benefited from orienting to specifics. Examining hippocampal engagement during both tasks showed a developmental shift from posterior to anterior hippocampus during specific encoding. Subregion engagement was also differently related to memory quality in children versus adults: While posterior hippocampus supported subsequent memory across age groups, both anterior and posterior hippocampus showed developmental differences in their link to false memories. Individual differences in the source of specific encoding along the long axis revealed that premature shifts towards an adult-like profile were disadvantageous to children’s memory. Our results suggest as development unfolds, refinements to both anterior and posterior subregion functionality supports memory imprecision.",

          "authors": "Björn Jörges; Laurence Harris",
          "abstract": "For many years the accepted wisdom in vision science has been that humans tend to underestimate the speed of an object when they pursue it with their gaze in comparison to when they fixate a spot in the visual scene and the object moves across the retina, an effect that is referred to as the Aubert-Fleischl phenomenon. However, experiments on the Aubert-Fleischl effect have generally employed a target moving in front of a blank background. For objects moving in the real world, relative motion between the object and the background provides additional cues, potentially allowing the visual system to compensate for the Aubert-Fleischl phenomenon. To test this hypothesis, we asked 50 participants to compare the speed of a single sphere to the speed of a sphere-cloud in a two-interval forced-choice task while they either followed the single sphere with their gaze or kept their eyes on a fixation cross. Stimuli were presented in virtual reality and the sphere’s movement could occur either in a completely black environment with no relative motion cues present, or against a visible, textured background behind the moving sphere. The probe sphere-cloud always moved in darkness. In a large data set (n = 50), we found no evidence for an Aubert-Fleischl effect, i.e., no evidence for an underestimation of speed during pursuit, in either of the environments. We report some evidence for an inversion of the Aubert-Fleischl effect, in which the tracked sphere appeared to move faster when pursued, particularly when relative motion was present. Our results challenge the prevailing notion that object speed is underestimated when the object is pursued versus when fixation is maintained and highlights the necessity to take into account characteristics of the visual scene.",

          "abstract": "Quantitative judgments have been suggested to result from a mixture of similarity- and rule-based processing. People can judge an object’s criterion value based on the object’s similarity to previously experienced exemplars and based on a rule that integrates the object’s cues like a linear regression. In order to better understand these processes, the present work combines cognitive modeling and eye tracking and tests whether people who rely more on the similarity to exemplars also look more at the exemplar locations on the screen. In two eye tracking studies, participants learned to assign each of four exemplars to a different screen corner and criterion value and then judged the criterion value of briefly presented test stimuli. Eye tracking measured participants’ gazes to the now empty exemplar locations (a phenomenon called looking-at-nothing); cognitive modeling of the test phase judgments quantified participants’ reliance on a similarity- over a rule-based process. Participants showed more similarity usage and more looking-at-nothing in the study in which the cues were linked to the criterion by a multiplicative function than in the study with an additive cue-criterion link. Focusing on the study with a multiplicative environment, participants relying more on the similarity to exemplars also showed more looking-at-nothing (τ = 0.25, p = .01). Within trials, looking-at-nothing was usually directed at the one exemplar that was most similar to the test stimulus. These results show that a multi-method approach combining process tracing and cognitive modeling can provide mutually supportive insights into the processes underlying higher-order cognition.",

          "abstract": "Two of the most actively studied modifiable lifestyle factors, exercise and video gaming, are regularly touted as easy and effective ways to enhance brain function and/or protect it from age-related decline. However, some critical lingering questions and methodological inconsistencies leave it unclear what aspects of brain health are affected by exercise and video gaming, if any at all. In a global online study of over 1000 people, we collected data about participants' physical activity levels, time spent playing video games, mental health, and cognitive performance using tests of short-term memory, verbal abilities, and reasoning skills from the Creyos battery. The amount of regular physical activity was not significantly related to any measure of cognitive performance; however, more physical activity was associated with better mental health as indexed using the PHQ-2 and GAD-2 screeners for depression and anxiety. Conversely, we found that more time spent playing video games was associated with better cognitive performance but was unrelated to mental health. We conclude that exercise and video gaming have differential effects on the brain, which may help individuals tailor their lifestyle choices to promote mental and cognitive health, respectively, across the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "Memories are always encoded within an environmental context. Autobiographical memories, also known as memories of everyday life events, may be particularly connected to the environment in which they took place due to the incorporation of context into other memory features (e.g., people, activity, emotion). However, little is known about how the relationship between an autobiographical memory and its context changes throughout the course of memory consolidation. One theory proposes that during consolidation, autobiographical memories are decontextualized and integrated into existing memory networks. In line with this theory, we predicted that remote memories would be less context-dependent than recent memories. In the current study, 353 participants recalled two recent episodic (within last two weeks) and two remote episodic (1.5 – 2.5 years old) autobiographical memories. They were then tested on novel measures of context-dependency and memory integration. Contrary to our predictions, we found that remote memories were more context-dependent, such that they were more difficult to imagine in a new location and would be more changed if imagined in a new location. Additionally, the locations listed for remote memories had a wider spatial scale compared to recent memories. One explanation for these results might be that remote memories are more difficult to imagine in a new location due to their wider spatial scale. However, spatial scale did not mediate the relationship between age and context-dependency. We conclude that rather than a linear decrease in context-dependency, autobiographical memories that remain episodic both have wider spatial scales and are more context-dependent.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive bias and lateralization/motor bias tests have been used to indicate animal affective state and welfare, particularly in dogs. This study examined the relationship between cognitive and motor bias in dogs tested in their homes, where any negative impacts of testing stress might be minimized. Motor bias was tested using the typical Kong Classic™ toy, as well as a novel toy for which paw touches generated movement- the Kong Wobbler™.  Beagles and huskies were trained to associate two bowl positions with reward or no reward. Cognitive bias was assessed by relative latency to approach a third bowl (ambiguous) position. Beagles had a significantly higher positive expectancy score (PES) than huskies, indicating they treated the ambiguous position similar to the rewarded position (i.e., positive affect). However, the latency of the huskies, but not the beagles, to the ambiguous bowl position increased over test trials, possibly indicating that the breeds treated the non-rewarded test trials differently. In the motor bias test,  the Kong Wobbler™ generated a higher rate of paw touches, with no significant differences in the direction or strength of motor bias compared to the KONG Classic™. However, our timed approach to the paw touch tests (vs. a required number of paw touches) did not reveal statistically significant lateralization in the dogs. Despite this, there was a significant correlation between affect and direction of lateralization; dogs who preferentially used their left paw during the Kong Wobbler™ test had lower PES. These results suggest that small methodological changes (home testing, Kong Wobbler™) hold promise for future research and that more consideration of breed effects in the interpretation of cognitive bias test results are warranted.",

Regional intergroup bias manifests in a systemic manner, and as such, regional bias predicts detrimental regional outcomes and structural disparities that may be difficult to study on the individual level. In the present research, we conducted a meta-analysis to examine the relationship between regional intergroup bias and various discriminatory outcomes, from racially biased traffic stops to disparities in employment for disabled people to health disparities for marginalized groups. In examining multiple types of bias against lower status groups, we found evidence for the relationship between regional intergroup bias and discrimination in various forms. This work furthers understanding of regional intergroup bias as a form of structural bias that predicts structural disparities. By studying regional intergroup bias, we gain a stronger understanding of how people may influence the bias of a region, and how regional biases may have devastating outcomes for marginalized groups in those regions.",

However, there is a major lack of evidence on chronic offending in low and middle-income countries; understanding these patterns is especially important in settings with very high levels of violence, like Brazil.\nAims: To identify the extent that crime is concentrated in chronic offenders and linked to violence and homicide in a Brazilian cohort. \nMethods: The 1982 Pelotas Birth Cohort includes 5,623 participants followed from birth in 1982 with complete crime records up to age 30. Chronic offenders were defined as individuals who committed five or more offences and over 50% of all crimes. Key offending characteristics including age of onset, violent and homicide offending, and incarceration rates were compared across three offender groups (one-timers, below-chronic, and chronic offenders).\nResults: Approximately 27% of participants committed at least one crime by age 30, and 5% were chronic offenders who were responsible for 57% of all crimes, 54% of violent crimes, and 68% of homicides. Chronic offenders exhibited more severe patterns of offending on all characteristics examined, compared to non-chronic offenders. Homicides committed by chronic offenders were more likely to involve firearms than those by non-chronic offenders.\nDiscussion: This is the first study to analyze chronic offending within a large, prospective cohort in a low and middle-income country. Chronic offending patterns in this Brazilian setting resemble those in high-income country studies, and are highly related to homicides.",

          "abstract": "We attempted to replicate previous findings of rising heritability and declining shared environmental influence on intelligence across development using the Twins Early Development Study—a large, longitudinal sample of British twins. Two longitudinal twin models (a Cholesky and Simplex model) were fitted to 9 waves of cognitive test data for 10,535 twin pairs. Heritability rose significantly from 24% at age 2 to 48-52% at age 16. Concurrently, shared environmental influence declined significantly from 65% to 9-13%. Moreover, nonshared environmental influences also increased significantly, rising from 11% to 39-40%. \n\nIn early childhood, developmental gains in heritability were explained by the emergence of new genetic influences. In later childhood and adolescence, gains in heritability were explained by the continued emergence of new genetic influences but also the amplification of pre-existing genetic influences. This evidence for genetic amplification suggests that active gene-environment correlation is partly responsible for gains in heritability later in development. Shared environmental influence declined across development because pre-existing environmental influences decayed between waves faster than new environmental influences accumulated. Lastly, the rise in nonshared environmental influence was principally explained by age-specific environmental effects that increased in magnitude across development.",

          "authors": "Orestis Zavlis",
          "abstract": "Despite almost a century of empirical research, the concept of personality disorder remains poorly understood and incredibly stigmatized. In this paper, I argue that most of the controversies and unresolved mysteries surrounding personality pathology can be traced back to a cognitive bias that I term the illusion of personality (pathology): our natural tendency to view most individual differences as personality differences (and their deviations from the norm as personality problems). I begin by illustrating how this illusion leads to the paradoxical, yet logical, conclusion that all mental disorders are personality disorders (an outcome that was a reality back in the 1900s). I then demonstrate how we can move beyond this illusion by defining each individual difference according to its predominant psychological theme (e.g., neuroticism as an ‘emotional’ trait) rather than by washing away that theme with the term ‘personality’ (i.e., neuroticism as a ‘personality’ trait). Subsequently, I apply this way of thinking to various personality constructs, including the five-factor traits, the self-other impairments of ‘personality disorder,’ and related social-cognitive disturbances, showing that all personality constructs that account for the development, maintenance, and treatment of personality disorder are all relational. On that basis, I argue that disorders of ‘personality’ can be respecified as disorders of ‘relationships,’ before concluding the paper with a set of suggestions on how we can move away from the illusory concept of ‘personality disorder’ and toward the more specific (and perhaps also humane) idea of ‘relational disorder.’",

While DCD and ADHD are considered separate conditions, their commonalities create challenges for differential diagnosis and support. Therefore, this preregistered broad-spanning scoping review includes systematic literature searches to summarize all available studies on DCD and/or ADHD. N = 68 articles were classified into the following categories: (i) neuroimaging, (ii) genetic and twin studies, (iii) methylphenidate, (iv) cognition, (v) motor skills, (vi) physical activity and physical therapy, (vii) perception, sensory processing, and visuomotor integration, (viii) psychosocial factors and wellbeing, and (ix) symptom presence and management. Most studies included samples under 18 years old and almost no studies were replicated. Common themes supported that individuals with co-occurring DCD and ADHD have more difficulties than those with one condition. While we found numerous neural and functional overlaps between DCD and ADHD, several features consistently differentiated the conditions, e.g., sensorimotor difficulties in DCD. Thus, we conclude that DCD and ADHD are similar conditions with a few differential features, however, co-occurring DCD+ADHD has unique burdens not observed in either condition alone. Extensive replication is needed to determine the precursors, stability, and changeability of DCD and/or ADHD.",

          "authors": "Mike W.-L. Cheung",
          "abstract": "There are various statistical models with different features and assumptions in meta-analysis. Popular models are, for example, the fixed-effect (or common effect), random-effects, and mixed-effects models. Apart from these models, several alternative models, such as the multiplicative error model (unrestricted weighted least squares model), the hybrid of additive and multiplicative error models, and the location-scale model, have been proposed in the literature. Understanding these models can be challenging for researchers without a solid mathematical background. Implementing or modifying these models is even more challenging for researchers unless they have advanced statistical and programming knowledge. This tutorial elucidates a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework to understand these models. Several R packages are introduced to facilitate the\nspecifications and generation of graphical models for these meta-analytic models. More importantly, researchers may use the full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation method to fit these models. This holds significant potential across two domains. First, it can be used as an educational tool in teaching and learning meta-analytic models. Second, the framework supports developing and evaluating novel meta-analytical models,\nwhich have not yet been implemented in current meta-analysis software, fostering advancements in meta-analytic methods. This tutorial also demonstrates with three real datasets how to extend it to address research questions involving complicated meta-analytic models, including nonlinear models, multivariate meta-analysis, and meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM). Limitations and future directions to extend the SEM-based meta-analysis are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Background and aims: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) often co-occur. There are a lack of longitudinal studies measuring the naturalistic development of PTSD and alcohol use problems in individuals with recent trauma exposure. This study aimed to compare the temporal relationships between posttraumatic stress symptoms and alcohol use over six months following trauma exposure in males and females. \n\nDesign: Large-scale longitudinal observational emergency department (ED)-based study of individuals with recent trauma exposure. \n\nSetting: Twenty-nine EDs across the United States. \n\nParticipants: Individuals with recent trauma exposure (n=2942, 62% female) were recruited from EDs within 72 hours of trauma exposure between 2017 to 2021. \nMeasurements: PTSD symptoms, measured via the PTSD Checklist for the DSM-5, and alcohol use was measured via the PhenX toolkit, were assessed at five time points: ED visit, 2 weeks, 8 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months following trauma.\n\nFindings: PTSD symptoms predicted lower future alcohol use between the pre-trauma to 2-week timepoints (b=-0.08, p=0.01) and higher use between the 3 to 6-month timepoints (b=0.06, p=0.01). There were no timepoints in which alcohol use predicted future PTSD symptoms. When stratifying by sex, male participants showed reciprocal associations, with alcohol use early after trauma predicting PTSD symptoms between 2 to 8 weeks (b=0.08, p=0.01), while PTSD symptoms predicted alcohol use between the 3 to 6-month timepoints (b=0.10, p=0.01). Female participants showed a different reciprocal pattern, with pre-trauma PTSD symptoms predicting lower alcohol use 2 weeks post-trauma (b=-0.08, p=0.04), while alcohol use subsequently predicted greater PTSD symptoms from 8 weeks to 3 months (b=0.04, p=0.04).\n\nConclusions: Males and females exhibit complex temporal development patterns of PTSD symptoms and alcohol use that align with the mutual maintenance hypothesis in men but the susceptibility hypothesis in females. These patterns are masked in analyses that do not stratify by sex.",

          "abstract": "Reliable measures are necessary for successful research studies, with unreliable measures significantly reducing the internal validity of studies when they are used. To combat this, measures are often developed using complex techniques, and ensuring they are reliable is of paramount importance. Despite this, reliability, is always estimated at the mean and assumed to be consistent across the distribution, but heterogeneity in this reliability may exist based on the portion of the distribution analyzed, with reliability differing when the measure is given to low, average, or high achievers. To address this, the present study focuses on the development of a novel method for estimating quantile-sensitive heterogeneity in reliability. This method was then applied to a set of measures from a publicly available dataset and was applied to both item-level and sum-score data, highlighting the flexibility of the approach. Results of the study found that the newly developed approach was effective in detecting the presence of heterogeneous reliability, finding statistically significant differences between the reliability at the lowest versus the highest quantiles within one of the measures tested.",

We highlight the study of altered states of consciousness as an opportunity to disentangle the physiological correlates of consciousness from agency.

However, less is known about whether scene consistency can also affect the processing of finer object features, such as the state of an object (e.g., the angle of a swiss army knife or the fill level of a bottle). Therefore across three experiments, we presented a subset of the JURICS stimulus set, where each object exists in 20 continuously varying states (e.g., from fully closed to fully open) in scenes that were either contextually consistent or inconsistent. Participants were asked to report the specific state of the object using a continuous report task. Our results showed that scene consistency enhanced the precision of state judgments, i.e. participants made significantly larger errors in reporting object states when objects were presented in inconsistent compared to consistent scenes. These findings suggest that scene context exhibits its effect already on the fine-grained perceptual processing of objects, affecting not only object categorization but the accuracy of its perceived features.",

          "abstract": "Positive emotions have important functions related to intra- and interindividual flourishing and well-being. At the turn of the century the interest in distinct positive emotions and their importance has skyrocketed due to the positive psychology movement. Since then, researchers have explored positive emotions beyond the category of happiness and research programs revolving around concepts such as awe or gratitude have been established. Navigating the field of positive emotions has become complicated though as many different taxonomies or conceptualizations of distinct positive emotions have been suggested. In the current project we review the theoretical and empirical literature on distinct positive emotions, investigating how many positive emotions can be distinguished, to what degree they overlap, and what higher order dimensions or categories can account for them. Focusing on 1,463 journal articles published across the last two decades, we identified 13,827 instances theorizing, mentioning, or measuring positive emotions and 170 different concepts employed. Narrowing down this list, 63 experts in emotion research rated the 48 most frequently investigated concepts regarding their conceptual similarity. Based on these results, we propose an integrative taxonomy of 28 positive emotions, forming six different superordinate categories or families that are based on the two dimensions of arousal and sociality. We identify challenges associated with research on positive emotions and provide suggestions on how to move the field forward from a theoretical and methodological perspective.",

          "abstract": "Sports are in many ways ideal for an expert performance approach. The skills needed are rich and complex, yet displayed in tightly constrained tasks that can be isolated and simplified for experimental control and analysis. Well-defined goals enable objective and precise performance evaluation, and participants are already highly practiced on representative tasks from their domain, and motivated to perform well. \n\nModern technology allows collection of large quantities of rich physiological and behavioral data, even in naturalistic settings. Indeed, the challenge often lies more in interpretation of the results and avoiding information overload, than the technical challenge of obtaining accurate measurements. Performance metrics that can summarize large quantities of data are therefore of both theoretical and applied interest; to the basic researcher they parametrize complex behavior into more elementary and interpretable components, to the practitioner they pinpoint aspects of technique to evaluate and improve. This paper discusses some foundational issues in the development of such metrics for high-speed sports, where human performance can be observed at the limit of physiological and information processing capacity. \n\nWe first define high-speed sports, make a logical distinction between criterion differentiator and proxy metrics, and discuss identifying expert performance directly in terms of performance parameters. We then illustrate three general problems - and how to deal with them - using concrete examples from the openly available IMSRace data set:\n\n(1) Extreme events. How to deal with fat tailed performance distributions, a characteristic of high-speed sport even at the expert level? \n\n(2) Expert superiority. How good does one need to be, to be an \"expert\"? We suggest that a Magnitude Based (physical) rather than Deviation based (statistical) approach is to be preferred in high-speed sport.\n\n(3) Dissecting performance. How to find predictors for performance for individuals with vastly different levels of skill? We discuss distribution asymmetries and ceiling effects.\n\nThe topic is of interest to experimental researchers on high-speed sports expertise, and expertise in related fields. Coaches, performance engineers and other practitioners may also gain insights from a more fundamental approach to performance data and its analysis.",

          "abstract": "Research on the diagnostic performance of radiologists using AI decision support system often relies on basic AUC comparison of AI use and non-AI use to draw conclusions about clinical decision-making, with known limitations. We re-evaluated a real-world dataset of radiologist use of AI across 127 pathologies and 1,163 cases to compare diagnoses in the face of four types of AI response: true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative. To corroborate our results with insights from cognitive psychology we use Signal Detection Theory, a model of decision-making, to better understand the impact of AI on clinical decisions. Finally, we simulate our results in the context of a wider healthcare clinic to envision these changes on a grander scale. Our results revealed important insights; with increased disease detection (higher sensitivity) at the cost of more false positives (lower specificity) and increased homogeneity of decision making amongst clinicians whose diagnoses are typically highly varied. Although usually considered a positive property, we warn that homogenisation may have negative implications at a system level by homogenising incorrect diagnoses. Further, we find highly confident radiologist decisions benefit the least from AI assistance. We conclude that the effects of introducing AI in clinical practice are outside of the scale of more common changes to practice, i.e. staffing, and that introducing AI to clinics may introduce higher disease detection but also unexpected consequences.",

          "abstract": "Parents are reporting a rise in mental health concerns, particularly in parents of young children. Unfortunately, only half of those with a mental health diagnosis report accessing services, and many report that current supports do not adequately address the extent of their needs. Social determinants of health, such as economic stability and education, are related to mental health outcomes in parents and children. The World Health Organization has highlighted the need for innovative parenting interventions that support overall parental and child wellbeing. One proposed strategy is the implementation a systems navigator role which connects families to services that address social determinants related to mental health. In this study, we hosted a knowledge exchange event where frontline service workers came together to discuss the barriers and facilitators to accessing and providing quality care, as well as the feasibility and acceptability of a proposed systems navigator role embedded within an evidence-based online mental health program called Building Emotional Awareness and Mental Health (BEAM). Focus group discussions were analyzed using thematic analysis. Five themes emerged which inform the relevance and implementation facilitators of a successful systems navigator role: (1) Hopes for Families; (2) Barriers to Service Access and Provision; (3) Facilitators to Service Access; (4) Fit of a Systems Navigator Role; and (5) Identified Support Need. These discussions highlighted that a supportive systems navigator role should connect families to services beyond mental health care to address social determinants contributing to their overall wellbeing. Navigators should foster long-term relationships with diverse community agencies to effectively support families. Finally, providers expressed a preference towards a hybrid online and in-person systems navigator, which could function depending on the family's needs. This research is a first step to implementing a navigation role who supports families and collaborates with providers across settings.",

          "abstract": "Eating disorders (EDs) are characterised by extreme concerns about food and weight. These concerns are linked to changes in decision-making, such as persisting with actions that are no longer rewarding. This study tested whether people with eating disorder symptoms show increased persistence due to altered decision thresholds. A group with heightened concerns about eating (ED; N=48) and a healthy control group (HC; N=56) completed a foraging task, in which an option on screen was exploited for reward. With each decision to exploit, reward feedback decreased and participants had to decide when to move on to a new option. Each block lasted 7.5 minutes. Behavioural persistence was measured as the number of seconds spent exploiting each option. Decision thresholds were measured when deciding to move on, as the counterfactual reward that would have been received for an exploit action. We predicted that the ED group would show increased persistence and decreased decision thresholds (i.e. lower counterfactual reward when deciding to move on). We found no evidence for these predictions. Instead, exploratory analyses showed that the ED group exhibited progressively faster response times (RTs) when approaching the time limit for each block. This increase in motor vigour correlated with the severity of eating disorder symptoms and total rewards earned. We discuss the potential utility of changing motor vigour as a transdiagnostic marker of ED tendencies.",

The content change of the subject angle corresponds to the structural change of the entity one by one. The change of internal structure of some complex entities can partially respond to external interaction. The change of entity structure， the corresponding change form in its subject angle is its subjective content. Even if a third-party entity can observe its change through induction， the angle change of the third-party entity and the main angle change of the entity structure cannot be exactly the same.\n2. 主体角度的唯一真实性\n主体角度的变化是对这个主体来说唯一真实的存在。两个实体在相互作用中，一个实体的主观角度来看，外界从空无产生了存在内容。这个过程中主体只能改变自身结构，主体角度的内容也是和自身结构变化一一对应。如果这个实体具有的内部结构可以对外界变化进行特征识别实现部分对应，那么其主观角度的存在内容就可以模拟相互作用中外界对其产生作用的事物。在具有显意识的动物中，这个主体角度的变化就是显意识。\n主体角度内容和所谓的第三方客观角度内容不同，因为第三方客观角度是抽象出来的一种对真实实体的抽象模拟形象，并不是真实实体的绝对客观形象，每个真实实体都具有无限多的角度形象，所以相当于是无形的。\n主体角度内容是实体能感应到的唯一真实存在，只是其客观对应的是自身的结构，如果模拟外界事物那就不是客观的了。\n3. 主体角度的非空间性\n所谓的客观空间只是一种对外部世界的抽象模型中的基础理解框架。这种世界抽象模型具有日常实践有效性，因此被认为是真实的。但是，主体角度对外界的一切内容都是模拟的，主体角度只代表自身的感觉。\n一些复杂的实体，通过视觉和触觉这种相互作用方式，根据长期互动积累的经验将自身感受状态映射为外界事物形象，以此形成所谓的客观世界。这个客观世界所具有的空间性，来自于思维对变化视觉景象和触觉变化存在一致性的抽象，这种抽象模型通过三个空间维度来解释外界变化，在一般的互动中非常有效，所以就被当做是真相。\n一切所谓的世界模型都是基于主体角度，对真实的无限维度本体进行模拟，所得到内容都是不真实的。主体角度只能对应自身变化，外界世界都是对变化建立的世界模型。",

Most research on this topic has focused on the first three to four years of life because this is a critical period for developing connections between the gut microbiome and the brain. Prior research has identified associations between variability in the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome in infancy and markers of temperamental risk for psychopathology, including negative affect. However, the specific microbes affected, and the directionality of these associations have differed between studies, likely due to differences in the developmental period of focus and assessment approaches. In the current preregistered study, we examined connections between the gut microbiome, assessed at two time points in infancy (2 weeks and 18 months of age), and negative affect measured at 30 months of age in a longitudinal study of infants and their caregivers. We found that infants with higher gut microbiome diversity and Veillonella abundance at 2 weeks of age, and higher Ruthenibacterium abundance at 18 months, showed more observed negative affect during a study visit at 30 months. These results suggest timing-specific associations between the gut microbiome and negative affect even within this early critical period.",

          "abstract": "The categorization of complex real-world stimuli, such as facial expressions, appears to vary greatly between people. This raises a crucial methodological challenge: how is it possible to elicit the mental representation of a complex category for a specific individual? Comprehensive category-elicitation methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People (MCMCP) work well across populations, but  converge too slowly to be usable with individual participants. Here, we address the problem of slow convergence with a new method: combining MCMCP with an adapted Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) acting as a “gatekeeper”. We tested this approach in a new experiment (N=90) on facial affect comparing MCMCP with the “gatekeeper” (MCMCPG) against baseline MCMCP and other variants. MCMCPG converged substantially faster than the other methods, in about 10 minutes for our task, with showing more representative recovered faces than its competitors. Further analyses captured participants’ substantial individual differences in a categorization task at an individual level. And, uniquely, the resulting model generalized these individual differences to real-world faces outside of our training set. Our study demonstrates the potential of MCMCPG for investigating generalizable human representations of complex stimuli at the individual level and illustrates the power of integrating Artificial Intelligence into psychological experiments.",

          "abstract": "Technological cognition—the capacity of humans to generate and interact with technology—emerges from the interplay of multiple neurocognitive systems. This perspective article proposes an integrated model grounded in physical understanding, synthesizing recent advances in cognitive neuroscience. We argue that technological cognition arises from the coordination of semantic knowledge, technical reasoning, visuospatial and motor skills, and social cognition. Key brain regions implicated include the parietal lobes—particularly the superior and inferior parietal cortices—the inferior frontal gyrus, and the temporal lobes. These areas support functions ranging from tool use and mechanical problem-solving to conceptual understanding and social learning. We suggest that technological artefacts not only reflect but also extend human cognitive capacities, forming a dynamic exchange between individual cognition and the environment. This integrated approach may have significant implications for clinical practice, education, and policy, offering potential pathways for novel diagnostic technologies and inclusive innovation. We advocate for interdisciplinary research to further elucidate the neurocognitive mechanisms underpinning technological cognition and to explore how different technologies may engage distinct cognitive processes and neural pathways. Understanding these mechanisms may foster a society better equipped to handle future challenges, ensuring that technological progress remains a shared human endeavor.",

          "authors": "Nathan Leroy; Arnaud D'Argembeau",
          "abstract": "Remembering the unfolding of past experiences usually takes less time than their actual duration. In this study, we examined the extent to which this temporal compression in memory depends on the number and duration of events that need to be maintained in a sequence. Participants were asked to watch and then mentally replay short videos depicting one, two, or three continuous events (i.e., people performing continuous actions in an uninterrupted way), each lasting 3, 6, 9, or 12 s. We computed remembering duration and a temporal compression index for each event. Results showed that event remembering duration was close to the actual event duration for short events, but smaller for longer ones (i.e., temporal compression was not systematic but occurred selectively depending on event duration). Furthermore, events were mentally replayed more quickly when they were part of a sequence of several events than when they were presented alone, and this decrease in the duration of event recall with the number of events was more pronounced for longer events. These results suggest that working memory capacity in representing naturalistic events is limited by both the number and duration of events to be retained, which may in part explain why the unfolding of events is temporally compressed in episodic memory.",

          "abstract": "Background and Hypothesis\nEmployment discrimination against people living with psychosis is well established, with implications for their quality of life. However, a meta-analysis of studies exploring this link has not yet been conducted. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to quantify employer attitudes and potential discrimination towards people living with psychosis.\n\nStudy Design\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of studies examining employer attitudes and hiring practices towards individuals with psychosis was conducted. Electronic databases were searched from inception to July 15, 2024. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed on six studies meeting our inclusion criteria.\n\n\nStudy Results\nStudies included in the systematic review consistently found that employers view individuals with psychosis as less employable compared to those with other health conditions or no disabilities. Meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant medium to large pooled effect size (Hedges g) of 0.57 (95% CI [0.21 to 0.94], p = 0.010), indicating statistically significant discrimination. Subgroup analysis estimated that 76.00% (95% CI [62.90% to 89.09%], p &lt;0.001) of employers expressed negative attitudes towards hiring individuals with psychosis.\n\nConclusions\nThis first meta-analysis on the topic reveals statistically significant (p = 0.010) employer discrimination towards individuals with psychosis, contributing to poor employment outcomes. Findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to address misconceptions and promote inclusive hiring practices. Future research should focus on developing and evaluating strategies to reduce workplace stigma and improve employment outcomes for people living with psychosis, potentially through adaptations of evidence-based supported employment models such as Individual Placement and Support (IPS).",

          "authors": "Marek Kwiek; Łukasz Szymula",
          "abstract": "In this research, we quantify an inflow of women into science in the past three decades. Structured Big Data allow us to estimate the contribution of women scientists to the growth of science by disciplines (N = STEMM 14 disciplines) and over time (1990-2023). A monolithic segment of STEMM science emerges from this research as divided between the disciplines in which the growth was powerfully driven by women – and the disciplines in which the role of women was marginal. There are four disciplines in which 50% of currently publishing scientists are women; and five disciplines in which more than 50% of currently young scientists are women. But there is also a cluster of four highly mathematized disciplines (MATH, COMP, PHYS, and ENG) in which the growth of science is only marginally driven by women. Digital traces left by scientists in their publications indexed in global datasets open two new dimensions in large-scale academic profession studies: time and gender. The growth of science in Europe was accompanied by growth in the number of women scientists, but with powerful cross-disciplinary and cross-generational differentiations. We examined the share of women scientists coming from ten different age cohorts for 32 European and four comparator countries (the USA, Canada, Australia, and Japan). Our study sample was N = 1,740,985 scientists (including 39.40% women scientists). Three critical methodological challenges of using structured Big Data of the bibliometric type were discussed: gender determination, academic age determination, and discipline determination.",

          "authors": "Daniela Alejandra Pastor",
          "abstract": "This work aims to characterize the segregation of Research Support Staff (RSS) in CONICET Argentina by gender, area of ​​knowledge and others characteristics through the request for public data of this personnel. It was determined that in August 2024, there are 2,931 active support staff working in 348 Institutes, and the amount of RSS assigned to each institution varies between 1 and 47. The institutes with the largest number of support staff by area of ​​knowledge are: the INTEMA (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencia y Tecnología de Materiales) in the KA area (Agrarian, Engineering and Materials Sciences) with 47 RSS, followed by the MACNBR (Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales) in the KB area with 42 RSS, the CADIC (Centro Austral de Investigaciones Científicas) in the KE area with 38 RSS, and in the KS area there are two institutes that compete to be in first place with 14 RSS, which are: the CEIL (Centro de Estudios e Investigaciones Laborales) and the CAICYT (Centro Argentino de Información Científica y Tecnológica).\tRegarding gender segregation by area of ​​knowledge, the feminized areas are: KB (Biological and Health Sciences), KS (Social Sciences and Humanities) and the masculinized areas: KA (Agrarian, Engineering and Materials Sciences); KE (Exact and Natural Sciences) and Not Applicable. The KT (Technology) area does not count any RSS personnel. It's curious that for the case of KA area (Agrarian, Engineering and Materials Sciences), the trend found for CONICET researchers is not reproduced by RSS because for them it is feminized, making it necessary to investigate the reasons for this deeply. The two areas with the largest number of support personnel assigned are KE: Exact and Natural Sciences; being masculinized, and KB: Biological and health sciences, being feminized. This analysis is a contribution to comprehension of the characteristics of CONICET's teem infrastructure roles, in order to advance the understanding of their work problems and barriers to professional growth.",

          "authors": "Guy A. Lavender Forsyth",
          "abstract": "A quarter of a century has passed since the late Terry Crowley summed up the academic consensus that the creole language Bislama poses no immediate threat to any of Vanuatu’s Indigenous languages. Does this remain true today? Since that time, evidence both quantitative and qualitative has been accumulating that suggests Bislama is indeed gaining ground at the expense of Vanuatu’s Indigenous languages. In a targeted review of this evidence, this article brings together and assesses the insights of linguists, ethnographers, and others on the causal mechanisms that explain an ongoing shift towards Bislama. It thereby provides both a critical analysis of the current state of knowledge and a provisional causal framework for understanding current threats, predicting future threats and, potentially, intervening to prevent future threats. Language endangerment and extinction is a global issue with devastating implications for communities worldwide – one which Vanuatu, the world’s most linguistically diverse country, has thus far remained resilient in the face of. However, this review of the available evidence warns that Bislama will continue to disrupt intergenerational transmission of Indigenous languages unless a suite of inter-related mechanisms can be counteracted.",

          "abstract": "The impact of scientific research beyond academia is receiving increasing attention from both scientists and the broader community. However, the mechanisms driving this impact remain unclear. This study systematically reviews existing theoretical models and seeks empirical evidence from the REF impact case data. Through grounded coding analysis of 200 cases across four units of assessment, six stages of research generating impact were identified – problem identification, research conduct, output production, output utilization, impact formation, and multi-stakeholder interaction. These stages encompass 10 key elements and 43 corresponding sub-categories, forming a novel theoretical model. Comparative analysis revealed that, while the generation of research impact beyond academia generally follows a similar logic across disciplines, obvious differences exist in motivation, research approach, forms of outputs, types of impacts, etc. This study further provides four typical cases for illustration. Our aim is to enhance the understanding of impact generation processes, promote the societal benefits of scientific research, and provide a basis for research managers to assess scientific contributions according to their distinct characteristics.",

          "abstract": "Expert institutions are increasingly expected not only to provide the best professional expertise but also to ensure equal presence of women. Yet while there is an extensive literature on descriptive gender representation in bureaucracies and courts, we largely lack studies that examine patterns of women’s presence on expert advisory bodies. Drawing on large-n data on the composition of Norwegian expert advisory commissions, the paper investigates and evaluates how the share of women on these commissions has developed over the last half-century. It finds that while overall gender parity was achieved in recent decades, women remain strongly under-represented among commission chairs, particularly academic chairs, and among commission members from economics, an especially important policy discipline. Normatively speaking, the developments towards parity are promising, and we find no empirical confirmation of the worry that proportional representation and competence requirements are in tension. On the contrary, persistent gender gaps among economists on commissions and academic chairs may endanger adequate provision of expertise into policy-making.",

          "abstract": "The super-rich rarely discuss their lives in public. On the rare occasion that they do so, provide interesting insights into the self-legitimization strategies. In this article, we study the discursive construction of wealth accumulation through arguments, frames, and metaphors drawing on the Sociology of cultural processes in the (re-)production of inequality. We use interviews with wealthy German family business owners in media outlets between 2014 and 2019. Applying thematic analysis, we demonstrate that these wealthy business owners discursively link the past, present, and future of their family and business. By doing so, they emphasize hard work to explain family wealth transitions and how such wealth is accumulated across generations. This temporal self-narration about business success tied to family structure creates a powerful discursive strategy to legitimize their wealth. Our findings contribute to the emerging field of media studies on the super-rich and wealthy dynasties.",

          "abstract": "Infection with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is associated with tens of thousands of hospitalizations in a typical year. Most US adults are not likely to experience severe cases of RSV infection, but adults aged 60 or older are at elevated risk of experiencing hospitalization or death due to RSV. While RSV vaccines are available for adults aged 60 or older, and have been shown to significantly reduce the likelihood that older adults experience severe cases of RSV, less than one quarter of those eligible have opted to receive the vaccine. In the context of RSV vaccination, Reversal Narrative (RN) messages share stories about individuals who previously refused to receive the vaccine, but – in response to personal negative health outcomes (“regret” RN messaging) and/or new scientific information (“rationalizing” RN messaging) – ultimately changed their mind. In a large and nationally representative survey (N = 1,300) of US adults, as well as a state-representative survey (N = 850) of a highly vaccinated US state, we demonstrate that unvaccinated adults over the age of 60 are significantly more likely to intend to receive an RSV vaccine when exposed to regret-focused (but not rationalizing) RN messaging. We conclude by discussing the viability of RN messaging as a vaccine promotion tactic, and consider how researchers might partner with health communicators to explore their viability in a wide range of health contexts.",

          "abstract": "Importance: While high levels of annual vaccination remains a key strategy for preventing the spread of new COVID-19 variants, most eligible Americans chose not to receive an updated vaccine in 2023. \n\nObjective: To assess the effectiveness of two new COVID-19 vaccine uptake communication strategies on annual COVID-19 vaccine uptake among vaccine hesitant sub-populations in a high vaccination state, and determine whether or not the messages “scale up” into an effective national messaging strategy. \n\nDesign: We administered four randomized controlled trials embedded in two large and representative public opinion surveys before and following the availability of updated COVID-19 vaccines. Trials 1 and 2 were conducted in June 2023, and randomly exposed a representative cross-section of adults in a highly vaccinated state (Rhode Island; Trial 1, N = 800) and a nationally representative cross-section US adults (Trial 2, N = 1,000) with messages that normalize the risks posed by endemic COVID-19 (vs. a control group). Trials 3 and 4 were conducted in October 2023, and randomly exposed analogous state (Trial 3, N = 800) and nationally representative survey respondents (Trial 4, N = 1,200) to messages that “de-normalize” constantly-mutating viral threats posed by endemic COVID-19 (vs. a control group).   \n\nSetting: Survey respondents were administered the trials online.\n\nParticipants: All adults aged 18 or over, residing in either the US (Trials 1, 3) or Rhode Island (specifically; Trials 2, 4), and who were members of a large, online, opt-in survey panel recruitment pool maintained by YouGov, were eligible for inclusion in this study.  \n\nInterventions: Respondents were randomly assigned to read a short message promoting annual COVID-19 vaccine uptake (vs. a control group, shown an unrelated message). In Trials 1 and 2, messages either made an effort to (a) normalize COVID-19 as endemic (“normalization” [NORM]), (b) both normalize and highlight the Long COVID health risks posed by endemic COVID-19 (“normalization + risk” [NR]), or (c) a control message unrelated to vaccination. In Trials 3 and 4, respondents were randomly assigned to either read (a) the aforementioned “NORM” message, (b) a message “de-normalizing” (DENORM) COVID-19 as a constantly mutating viral risk, or (c) a study-wide control message.\n\nOutcomes &amp; Measures: The primary outcome variable in this study measures respondents’ self-reported intentions to receive an annual COVID-19 vaccine. The primary explanatory variable in our analyses is an indicator of experimental condition assignment, stratified by whether respondents (a) received a full COVID-19 vaccine sequence &amp; at least one booster shot, (b) received some form of COVID-19 vaccination, but no boosters, or (c) are unvaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nResults: In Trials 1 and 2, we find that unvaccinated Rhode Islanders exposed to the NR messaging, but not NORM messaging, were significantly more likely to intend to receive an annual COVID-19 vaccine (NORM: B = 0.13, CI = -0.03, 0.30, p = 0.11; NR: B = 0.22, CI = 0.00, 0.44, p = 0.05). In Trials 3 and 4, we find that exposure to DENORM messaging, but not NORM messaging, is also associated with annual COVID-19 vaccine uptake among unvaccinated Rhode Islanders (NORM: B = 0.19, CI = -0.03, 0.41, p = 0.10; DENORM: B = 0.23, CI = 0.01, 0.44, p = 0.04). We detect no significant effects in either of our national samples, which post hoc analyses suggest might result from observed and unobserved differences in unvaccinated populations across Rhode Island and national samples.\n\nConclusions: Our work suggests that messaging emphasizing both the endemic health risks (“NR”) and challenges of combating new COVID-19 variants (“DENORM”) may be effective at increasing annual COVID-19 vaccine uptake in unvaccinated populations, and suggest opportunities for future research regarding how differences in state public health contexts might moderate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine communication.",

We document new facts about the absolute and relative mobility in lifespan. On average across cohorts, 47% of men and 57 percent of women lived longer than their parents, though this varied across cohorts. Relative measures show higher mobility, with substantially less variation across time and subpopulations. The intergenerational correlation in lifespan (a measure of persistence rather than mobility) is about 0.09 for both sexes – this low correlation is observed across races, education groups, cohorts, and birth states. Finally, we document that the intergenerational persistence of lifespan is much smaller than the persistence in socio-economic status. Moreover, correlations in lifespan and in education are largely independent of each other, suggesting that mobility in well-being may be larger than measures of income alone suggest.",

In contexts where extended kin are important sources of social support, there may be additional benefits for children from increased education of their kin. We test the hypothesis that children benefit from having more educated kin using data from an innovative longitudinal project in two low-income communities in Nairobi, Kenya. Leveraging variation in kin members’ exposure to a national policy to lower the cost of secondary school education to account for selection, we find not only an improvement in education levels of kin but also significant intergenerational benefits for children in their families through improved household food security and faster language acquisition. However, we find no evidence that exposure to educated kin improves the nutritional status of these children. The implications of our findings are profound, as they demonstrate the contemporaneous benefits of educational expansion as well as the longer-term effects on subsequent generations, prompting us to rethink the role of education in shaping the well-being of children in low-income communities.",

Theory and evidence indicate that reducing crime opportunities is an effective means of crime control, including restrictions on lethal weapons.

Here we argue that replacing lethal pointed-tip kitchen knives with round-tip knives would reduce knife crime with little or no displacement, and may reduce other forms of violence. Drawing on the approach to remove fossil-fuel vehicles from roads, we propose a phased removal of lethal kitchen knives and estimate this will cut knife crime in half.",

However, access to these courses varies within and across school contexts, potentially shaping students’ educational trajectories. This study examines access to college prep courses in Texas, exploring how school characteristics predict course offerings and how these offerings predict course-taking. We also determine whether college prep course-taking affects postsecondary attainment within 12 years of high-school graduation. Results show that larger, urban, and suburban schools with higher academic achievement and less economic disadvantage offer more college prep courses. Schools offering more college prep courses see greater student course-taking, particularly among higher-achieving students. Additionally, taking more prep courses is associated with higher postsecondary credential and bachelor’s degree attainment, especially for lower-achieving students. We recommend that practitioners focus on increasing enrollment in existing college prep coursework, then expand offerings as demand grows.",

          "authors": "Sho Miyazaki; Kento Yamada; Kosuke Imai",
          "abstract": "While partisan gerrymandering has been found to be widespread for Congressional redistricting in the United States, there exists little empirical research on legislative redistricting in other countries. We investigate the partisan bias of Japanese redistricting. Some scholars have argued that the prominent role played by the non-partisan commission leaves little room for partisan gerrymandering. Others have pointed out, however, that the Japanese redistricting process may be subject to political influence. The members of the redistricting commission must be appointed by the Prime Minister and be approved by the Diet. In addition, the commission invites the governors of all prefectures to provide their opinions regarding districting. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis to estimate the partisan bias of the 2022 Japanese Lower House redistricting plans. We apply a state-of-the-art redistricting simulation algorithm to generate a large number of alternative non-partisan redistricting plans. The sampled plans are representative of the population of plans and are consistent with the redistricting rules with which the commission must comply. By comparing the enacted plan with this non-partisan baseline, we quantify the extent to which the enacted plan favors a particular party. Unlike the traditional methods, our simulation approach accounts for political geography and redistricting rules specific to each prefecture. Our analysis shows that the Japanese redistricting process yields little partisan bias both at the prefecture and district levels.",

          "authors": "Jessica Claris Fisher; Martin Dallimer; Gail Austen; Kate Irvine; Sam G. Aizlewood; Peter M. King; Hazel A. Jackson; Rob D. Fish; Zoe G. Davies",
          "abstract": "Biodiversity declines are accelerating globally, impacting ecosystem functioning, with consequences for human health. Interactions with biodiversity can benefit human wellbeing, leading to avoided healthcare costs. However, existing research does not account for the species within ecological communities and their effect traits that elicit wellbeing (e.g. colours, sounds). Many species’ effect traits are seasonal, and spatial variation in exposure to ecosystems by different sectors of society can lead to unequal opportunities to gain wellbeing. Here, we use a novel analytical approach to explore how the relationship between forest biodiversity and wellbeing fluctuates: (1) temporally, between different seasons, and (2) spatially, across the socioeconomic deprivation continuum of a human population at a national scale (England and Wales). Forest species’ effect trait richness is spatially heterogeneous, particularly in autumn, spring, and summer. Broadleaf forests have greater species’ effect trait richness than other categories of forest. Forests with higher species’ effect trait richness, and forests that resulted in higher self-reported participant wellbeing, were in areas with the least socioeconomic deprivation. Forest creation/restoration and nature-health interventions must recognise this ecological and social diversity to ensure initiatives are equitable and socially just. Conserving biodiversity will therefore better deliver ecosystems that underpin healthier individuals and societies.",

ChatGPT in der universitären Ausbil-dung für qualitative Methoden empirischer Sozialforschung eingesetzt werden können. Um die Möglichkeiten und Grenzen eines solchen Vorhabens seriös ab-zuschätzen, geht es einerseits darum, die derzeitige Leistungsfähigkeit solcher Modelle auszuloten und andererseits das Ziel einer qualitativen Methodenausbil-dung zu bestimmen, denn nur dann lässt sich abschätzen, an welchen Stellen der Ausbildung der Einsatz generativer Sprachmodelle sinnvoll ist. Daher werden wir uns in diesem Beitrag auch mit den Voraussetzungen für die universitäre Lehre qualitativer Methoden der Sozialforschung auseinandersetzen. \nWir beschreiben zunächst knapp die herkömmliche Methodenausbildung an-spruchsvoller qualitativer Methoden im Rahmen von Forschungswerkstätten (1). Anschließend stellen wir die neuen Möglichkeiten des Interpretierens zusammen mit generativen Sprachmodellen vor und legen hierbei einen Schwerpunkt auf unser Konzept des Reconstructive Social Research Promptings (RSRP) (Lieder &amp; Schäffer, 2024) (2). Danach geben wir einen komprimierten Einblick in unser Konzept des Interpretierens zusammen mit generativen Sprachmodellen (Schäffer &amp; Lieder, 2023), das mittlerweile auch einen Vorschlag für das konkrete Vorge-hen beinhaltet. Im dritten Kapitel beleuchten wir die KI-induzierten Herausforde-rungen für die qualitative Methodenausbildung im Kontext der Vermittlung von Methodenwissen und Methodenkönnen.",

          "authors": "Xia Liu",
          "abstract": "“神秘”的音乐美学接受结果大量涌现在19世纪的德语报刊杂志音乐文献中。在19世纪的德语文化圈中，神秘主义始终参与着音乐发展的进程。神秘美学术语在巴赫、舒曼、韦伯和瓦格纳音乐中被提及得最多。从巴赫的宗教表达、到黑格尔所时代开始的不可理解和内向性器乐作品，到韦伯幻想般的浪漫主义开端，再到舒曼的诗意和神秘浪漫主义，最后到瓦格纳以德国神话和传说为基础的歌剧革命，神秘一直与自我内在、深奥、宗教及浪漫主义的音乐表达保持着紧密联系。The aesthetic reception of “mystical” or “mysterious” music experienced a significant rise in 19th-century German-language periodicals and musical literature. Throughout the 19th century, mysticism played a consistent and integral role in the evolution of music within the German cultural sphere. The terminology of mystical or mysterious aesthetics was particularly prevalent in the works of composers such as Bach, Schumann, Weber, and Wagner. This connection ranges from Bach's religious expressions to the introspective and, at times, incomprehensible instrumental compositions emerging in the Hegelian era, through Weber’s fantastical initiation of Romanticism, Schumann’s poetic and mystical approach to the movement, and culminating in Wagner’s operatic revolution, which drew heavily on Germanic myths and legends. Across these various forms, mysticism maintained a close relationship with expressions of the inner self, religious sentiment, and the broader aesthetics of Romantic musical expression.",

          "abstract": "Objective: This study examines educational heterogeneity in the impact of parental separation on educational attainment, considering the full sequence of childhood family structural changes.\nBackground: Studies have consistently associated parental separation with lower socioeconomic achievement. However, the underlying causes remain unclear, possibly due to self-selection or continued instability in the family environment.\nMethod: This study employs structural causal modeling and Bayesian logistic regression to investigate the causal effect of childhood family structural changes on adult educational attainment using Finnish full-population register data (n = 272,962), focusing on cohorts born in 1987–1991 and their family members.\nResults: A substantial portion of the 17-percentage-point disadvantage of children from separated families was due to the selection of families into separation and further structural changes. Separation effects followed a U-shaped pattern, with the largest negative effects among families in the middle of the educational gradient. Stepparents did not exert positive or negative effects, except for highly educated parents’ children benefiting from stable stepfathers. Recurring family instability had the largest negative impact.\nConclusion: The curvilinear relationship between parental and child education may partly explain the mixed results of previous studies.\nImplications: Given that recurring family instability was shown to be the most detrimental to children’s educational attainment, low-threshold guidance and support to aspiring and existing blended families might have the largest impacts on children of separated parents.",

          "authors": "Ingrid K van Dijk; Niels van den Berg",
          "abstract": "The average lifespan has increased strongly in the past decades, but not everyone has benefited equally. Establishing the degree of intergenerational persistence of survival generates insights into broad inequalities between individuals and families in their likelihood to live to high ages. Using established register-type data for a region in Southern Sweden 1880-2015, we show that even before the rise of the modern social gradient in health in the 1960ies, mortality is lower among descendants from long-lived parents (top survivors of their birth cohort). This shared survival advantage between parents and children persists over time even after considering SES. Mortality among the descendants of top survivors is lower in lifestyle-related causes of death, suggesting that behavioral factors could be a significant factor in explaining the survival advantage, but also. Overall, we find that mortality concentrates in families in patterns that go beyond the influence of SES alone. Similarities between relatives in health and mortality therefore provide an important lens into inequalities in survival and health over time.",

We discuss the two main investigatory branches, the Evolutionary Cognitive Archaeology (ECA) that focuses on the evolutionary development of human cognition and the Ideational Cognitive Archaeology (ICA) that focuses on the thoughts and beliefs of ancient societies, along with the emerging 4E (embodied, embedded, extended, and enacted) strand that is concerned with the role of material forms within human cognition. We also differentiate cognitive archaeology from disciplines like evolutionary psychology in terms of foundational assumptions, theories, methods, and epistemological orientations. Finally, we outline the Handbook’s structure and organization.",

          "abstract": "This chapter discusses the use of the terms symbols, symbolism, and symboling in the archaeological literature. The lack of definition and any grounding in cognitive theory makes identifying prehistoric symbols and symboling more art than science. A multiplicity of claims from the literature highlight the tendency to claim almost any form from any period of prehistory as symbolic. After the problem is defined, an alternative approach is proposed. The alternative suggests grounding symbols and symboling in contemporary cognitive theory; this would permit the construct to be operationalized as qualities potentially discernable in prehistoric material forms. A multi-level construct is also proposed, one that is not only capable of differentiating symbolic cognition as exhibited by the human species today from the presumably non-symbolic cognition of contemporary non-human primates but which is also able to differentiate both from the emergent symboling capacities of ancestral hominins.",

The purpose of the present chapter is to discuss the potential cognitive consequences of three well-established brain differences and their possible eventual role in the extinction of Neandertals. These morphological brain differences include larger olfactory bulbs, expanded parietal lobes, and a larger cerebellum-to-cerebrum ratio in Homo sapiens compared to Neandertals. The phenotypic consequences of these brain differences include better smell identification and sensitivity, with implications for mate selection and disease immunity; enhanced social cognitive abilities and greater theory of mind; and innovation and creativity, respectively.",

The first uses traditional archaeological methods and criteria to examine and characterize marks on prehistoric artifacts for the purpose of assessing whether they were notations. The second uses a theoretical framework in which cognition is extended—meaning that material forms are a component of the mind—in order to understand the role of counting devices in numerical cognition. Each answers a different question: The traditional approach is concerned with understanding the intent and meaning of artifactual marks, while the extended approach focuses on how material forms contribute to numerical realization, explication, and elaboration. Both highlight ongoing issues in investigating prehistoric numeracy, which might benefit from a combined and expanded methodology.",
