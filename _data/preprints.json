          "abstract": "Contrario a la creencia popular, la inteligencia artificial no es errática: su confiabilidad depende del lenguaje humano que la activa. La IA responde en espejo, según el orden simbólico, semántico y emocional del usuario. No es que mienta, sino que proyecta. Por ello, respuestas divergentes sobre un mismo tema son esperables cuando el prompt no está blindado.\n\nMientras gran parte del mundo aún teme lo que la IA “pueda decir”, China ya implementó su enseñanza estructurada desde edad escolar, entendiendo que el verdadero riesgo no es la IA, sino la falta de alfabetización del usuario.\n\nEste estudio propone el entrenamiento simbólico como interfaz necesaria entre humanos no entrenados y modelos complejos. Al calibrar el lenguaje, la IA no solo responde con precisión: se convierte en una herramienta terapéutica, científica y evolutiva.",

          "title": "Cognitive Morphogenesis: How Prediction, Consciousness, and Language Co-Emerge from an Experience-Centered Mind",
          "authors": "Leonardi Salvatore",
          "abstract": "This article introduces an innovative, experience-centered theory of mind that sheds light on the co-emergence of consciousness and language. Moving beyond fragmented, mechanistic accounts, our model posits the Prognostic Mind (Prognostica Mens) as the universal operational principle, continuously generating and verifying predictions. Crucially, the very formation of these predictions and knowledge itself is governed by Cognitive Morphogenesis, a fundamental process describing how understanding is generated and organized across all cognitive levels through the dynamic interplay of two omnipresent Cardinal Principles: the Holistic Self (HS) and the Quantum Self (QS). \n\nThe HS is responsible for the synthesis of unified forms and identities, crucial for coherent conscious experience, while the QS manages the differentiation of figures and their intricate relationships, fundamental for structured thought and linguistic parsing. These principles underpin three evolved functional spheres: the \"I Act\" (perceptual-motor predictions), the \"I Socialize\" (social-emotional predictions), and the \"I Think\" (abstract cognitive and symbolic predictions). The \"I Think,\" unique to humans, is where the Prognostic Mind's operational mode fully articulates into abstract thought, self-reflection, and the sophisticated generation and processing of language and consciousness. \n\nIn this continuous cycle, perception and action are intrinsic goals of the anticipation/verification method, with perception verifying cognitive anticipations and execution performing actions to verify intentional ones. We illustrate how this framework applies from basic neurophysiological mechanisms, such as gamma motoneurons (γ-MNs) and muscle spindles in embodied attention, to higher-level cognitive processes like language, supported by compelling neurophysiological evidence from Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) in semantic and syntactic processing. The model's high-level generalization capacity provides a coherent lens for interpreting complex phenomena, including the formation of grammatical categories and language acquisition, laying groundwork for future in-depth exploration of its neurophysiological underpinnings.",

          "title": "Attentional capture by Pavlovian signals of reward readily generalises across contexts",
          "authors": "Jack Collins; Daniel Pearson",
          "abstract": "Reward-signalling stimuli capture attention and gaze—a phenomenon known as value-modulated attentional capture (VMAC). Prior work in which there is initially an instrumental relationship between attending to the reward-associated stimulus and receiving reward has shown that VMAC is context-specific. However, it is unclear whether VMAC remains context-specific when attending to the reward-associated stimulus is never a requirement of the task (i.e., stimuli have only a Pavlovian relationship with reward). Across three experiments, participants made saccades to a target shape to earn reward. Coloured distractors signalled different reward values depending on background context images, but making a saccade to the reward-signalling distractors caused the omission of reward. Unlike the context-specific biases observed previously, we found that VMAC trained under these conditions readily generalised across contexts: distractors that signalled high-value reward in one context captured attention in the high-value context, as well as in contexts where they signalled low reward, and in novel contexts. This pattern of context-independent capture occurred despite participants reporting explicit awareness of the context-stimulus-reward contingencies. These findings suggest fundamental differences in the way that Pavlovian and instrumental reward learning mechanisms interact with attentional control. We propose a dual-pathway account, where Pavlovian stimulus-reward relationships result in context-independent increases in attentional priority, while instrumental stimulus-reward relationships trigger context-dependent activation of target templates. Understanding these distinct pathways has important implications for theories of attention and for addressing maladaptive reward-related attentional biases in clinical populations.",

          "abstract": "Background: The majority of studies examining the relationship between fitness and cognition examine a single physical attribute. Here, we assessed the relative contributions of multiple modifiable physical attributes and demographic variables to cognition in healthy older adults.\n\nMethods: Older adults (N = 619; mean age = 74.9, SD = 6.9) completed multiple physical attribute assessments (walking speed, respiratory function, grip strength, BMI) and cognitive tasks as part of the Health and Retirement Study. Principal components analysis was used to create cognitive composite scores, which revealed two domains: executive functions/processing speed and episodic memory. Lindeman, Merenda, and Gold analysis was employed to assess the relative importance of demographic and modifiable physical attributes to each cognitive domain.\n\nResults: Age, education, walking speed, and respiratory function explained the greatest amount of variance in the relative importance analysis for both executive functions/processing speed and episodic memory. Modifiable variables, including walking speed and respiratory function, accounted for similar amounts of variance as age and education in predicting executive functions/processing speed performance. After controlling for demographic variables, modifiable physical performance variables of walking speed and respiratory function collectively accounted for an additional 9.9% and 3.3% variance in executive functions/processing speed and episodic memory, respectively.\n\nConclusions: These results indicated that modifiable physical performance variables are differentially associated with cognitive performance. Fitness indicators can account for similar amounts of variance as age in executive functions/processing speed in healthy older adults.",

Building on our earlier proposal that attachment patterns reflect differences in epistemic trust, we examine how this framework can illuminate three further key areas of AAI classification: (1) the AAI subclassifications (2) the unresolved/disorganized (U/d) classification; and (3) additional features typical of speakers who are assigned the secure/autonomous AAI classification, including mentalizing. By integrating Relevance Theory, we argue that these dimensions of variation reflect epistemic styles, or systematic differences in how individuals evaluate and share knowledge within interpersonal exchanges. This approach refines our understanding of the AAI coding system and further supports a possible theoretical shift towards conceptualizing attachment differences as fundamental variations in socio-epistemic processes.

          "abstract": "This article builds upon the socio-epistemic theory of attachment introduced in Part I, proposing that adult attachment classifications, as measured by the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), reflect differences in fostering epistemic trust. While the AAI has been shown to reliably predict caregiving sensitivity and infant attachment patterns, questions remain regarding the precise nature of what it measures. We argue that attachment-related differences in the AAI reflect generalized communication tendencies rather than merely responses to attachment-related content. Drawing on Relevance Theory, we suggest that secure, dismissing, and preoccupied AAI classifications correspond to distinct ways of optimizing relevance in communication— balancing informativeness and processing effort in ways that shape epistemic trust. We illustrate this framework through analyses of AAI discourse patterns and psychotherapy transcripts, demonstrating that these communicative tendencies extend beyond attachment-specific contexts. This perspective offers a unified account of attachment representation, communication styles, autobiographical narratives, and intergenerational transmission of attachment, reframing attachment-related discourse differences as variations in the ability to establish epistemic trust across relationships and contexts.",

          "abstract": "This article, written in honor of Mary Main’s legacy, introduces a new socio-epistemic theory of\nattachment and attachment-related differences. Inspired by Main’s pioneering work on attention and discourse, we integrate insights from epistemic trust theory (Fonagy &amp; Allison, 2014) and cognitive pragmatics (Sperber &amp; Wilson, 1986) to argue that attachment patterns are not specifically adaptations to caregivers’ responsiveness to distress, but broader strategies for optimizing communication. Namely, we propose that attachment patterns reflect variations in epistemic trust towards the caregiver—the trust in the relevance and authenticity of interpersonal communication. Our framework helps explain key findings of attachment research, including the so-called 'intergenerational transmission of attachment,' as well as the association between attachment differences and a broad range of developmental outcomes seemingly unrelated to threats and safety, but to communication and learning. In Part I, we examine how infants adjust their epistemic trust in response to caregiver communication, shaping attachment patterns and later development. In Part II (forthcoming), we extend this model to a view of AAI classifications as differences in fostering epistemic trust. In Part III (forthcoming), we apply our perspective to explain AAI subclassifications, the unresolved AAI classification, mentalizing, and more, further celebrating Main’s legacy in attachment theory and research.",

          "abstract": "In uncertain and dynamic environments, biological agents must adapt their decision-making strategies to maximize rewards. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) models typically assume that such adaptation is governed by dynamic value updates controlled by fixed parameters or predefined schedules. However, these assumptions limit the models' ability to capture the flexible and context-sensitive nature of biological decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we introduce \\textit{DynamicRL}, a novel framework that estimates RL parameters from behavioral data on a trial-by-trial basis. We demonstrate that DynamicRL substantially improves the predictive performance of standard RL models across eight decision-making tasks, thereby reducing scientific regret.\n\nDynamicRL captures the rich temporal variability inherent in decision-making behavior, achieving predictive performance comparable to that of recurrent neural networks trained directly on the data, while preserving the interpretability and theoretical grounding of RL models. Moreover, it enables the examination of how agents dynamically adjust RL parameters in response to environmental changes, offering insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying such adaptations. Thus, DynamicRL serves as an efficient data-driven framework for estimating RL parameters, facilitating fine-grained behavioral analysis with potential applications in computational psychiatry and neuroscience.",

          "abstract": "Adaptively updating memories about familiar others is an important social skill. Here, we examined whether strong or weak social memories are more prone to updating when violated. Participants viewed well-known characters’ emotional reactions to food items either repeatedly or only once. They then studied new events where some characters exhibited unexpected emotions to the same food items, violating initial memories. We found that when violated, strong existing memories, compared to weak memories, led to worse learning of new information, suggesting the resistance of strong memories to updating. Further, using a novel behavioral metric, we assessed the mechanistic role of memory reactivation in the updating of strong and weak memories. We showed that when encountering conflicting information, instead of reflecting their relative encoding strength, reactivation of weak memories reached a level similar to that of strong memories. Meanwhile, strong memories that were more reactivated showed higher likelihood to incorporate new information.",

To guide and encourage work on emotion regulation and the climate change situation, we describe a precise conceptual and temporal framework that brings together two emotion-related cycles, climate change information, and climate change solutions. We suggest that climate change information prompts emotion generative processes that are prone to influence by emotion regulatory processes. Emotional and emotion-regulatory responses to climate change information may affect and be affected by beliefs, behavior, and systems. First, we apply a common theory of emotion regulation to the climate change situation. Then, we review evidence for the use of climate change emotion regulation and expound the potential for emotion regulation to be involved with climate change solutions. Beliefs, behavior, and systems are conceptualized as climate change solutions. Belief is multidimensional (e.g., human causation and negative consequences), as is behavior (e.g., consumer behavior, decision making). Systems can include laws, regulations, infrastructure, and transportation; we highlight the importance of both social and physical systems. We close with suggestions for applying the framework, including experimental tests of emotion regulation.",

          "title": "The Psychological Impacts of Avian Influenza",
          "authors": "Steven Taylor",
          "abstract": "Psychology is vital for understanding and managing pandemics. Psychology is essential for understanding (1) adherence to pandemic mitigation methods (e.g., hygiene guidelines), (2) societally disruptive phenomena that complicate pandemic management (e.g., panic buying), and (3) mental health problems that develop or worsen in response to pandemic-related stressors. The present article examines how outbreaks of avian influenza (AVI) have psychologically impacted people and considers the implications if an AVI pandemic were to emerge. The risk of an AVI pandemic is currently low but rising. Over the past decade, AVI outbreaks have increased in frequency, and avian viruses have expanded their range of hosts, infecting a growing number of mammalian species, including humans. The role of psychological factors has been neglected in AVI pandemic preparation guides. The present article aims to fill that gap by reviewing the research pertinent to the psychology of AVI. Many of the psychological phenomena observed in AVI outbreaks have been documented in past pandemics: Fear of infection, anger, avoidance, disease-related stigmatization, xenophobia, conspiracy theories, panic buying, and personal stockpiling have all arisen in response to AVI outbreaks, fueled by media sensationalism. These psychological phenomena may persist and intensify if AVI outbreaks evolve into an AVI pandemic. Indeed, such phenomena have been frequently observed in past pandemics, such as COVID-19. The lessons learned from COVID-19 can be used to prepare for a possible AVI pandemic, including considerations of how to (1) improve adherence to pandemic-mitigation measures such as vaccines and facemasks, (2) circumvent the adverse effects of lockdown on mental health, and (3) address the mental health needs of groups at high risk of infection. Additional measures may be needed for an AVI pandemic. Fear, disgust, and avoidance of specific foods would likely distinguish an AVI pandemic from COVID-19. The threat of infected food triggers disgust, and so food-related disgust would likely be a prominent emotional reaction during an AVI pandemic. Public messaging from health authorities and others has the potential to either ease or exacerbate public concerns about foods, depending on how the messages are crafted.",

          "authors": "Jan Marius Keppel Hesselink",
          "abstract": "Contemplative traditions universally acknowledge paths centered on inner light and inner sound. This article introduces the Yoga of the Inner Body, a third, less formally recognized, yet equally fundamental path rooted in the direct perception of subtle, endogenous bodily sensations that arise during deep meditative and contemplative states. These phenomena, including fine shivers, waves of warmth, electric tingling, pulsations, and full-body stillness paired with inner vibrations, are presented not as symbolic or pathological, but as direct expressions of consciousness. We propose that this practice culminates in a state of \"vibrancy,\" where the body is experienced as a unified, intelligent field of presence, transcending its anatomical boundaries. Through a fresh phenomenological lens, this paper maps these sensations, offers guidance for their cultivation, and explores cross-cultural parallels, revealing the Yoga of the Inner Body as a direct, embodied pathway to self-realization and a crucial component for a comprehensive understanding of inner transformation.",

          "abstract": "When individuals repeatedly study and recall information across multiple learning trials their responses exhibit increasing levels of subjective organization. Whereas classic studies investigated the evolution of organization across lists within the short-time span of a single session, here we ask how memory changes over many days.  Specifically, we examine how semantic, temporal, and subjective organization during a recall period shapes memory after days of intervening cognitive activity. Analyzing data from two multi-session free recall experiments, we find that subjects demonstrate a strong tendency to cluster recalls based on previous output order, with this effect strengthening across sessions. In line with the idea that thoughts become memories, we show that even false memories produced on a given session tend to re-occur on subsequent days. Our results attest to the crucial role that retrieval plays in shaping long-term episodic memory.",

          "authors": "Pablo Dapica; Julio Santiago; Pablo Solana",
          "abstract": "The body-specificity hypothesis proposes that people with different bodies should also have different conceptual systems. The test case of this hypothesis has been the association of emotional valence (good vs. bad) with lateral space (left vs. right) in people of different handedness. As expected, right-handers tend to associate the good with right space, whereas left-handers show the opposite association. This body-specific effect has been very influential and followed up by an important number of studies. Here, we undertake a systematic examination of the quality of this literature by means of z-curve analysis. The results show that the expected replicability rate (statistical power) of this literature is reasonably high (71-76%), especially for those studies using binomial tasks and those that entail the severest tests for the hypothesis, whereas it is lower in reaction time studies. Moreover, the presence of publication bias cannot be statistically asserted. All in all, the literature on space-valence body-specificity appears solid, although there is still room for improvement.",

          "abstract": "A defining aspect of tonality in Western music is that different musical pitches are perceived to have different stabilities: listeners expect unstable pitches to resolve to stable pitches such as the tonic, which is the most stable. To investigate possible explanations for these hierarchies of tonal stability, we conducted three experiments where participants rated the ‘fit’ and ‘stability’ of probe tones contextualized by a variety of musical scales including familiar and unfamiliar scales in 12-tone equal temperament, and the ‘stability’ of probe tones contextualized by unfamiliar scales in 22-tone equal temperament. Context scale pitches were presented in random order to minimize tonal cues beyond scale structure. Using Bayesian multilevel regression, we modelled the ratings with an acoustical feature (spectral pitch class similarity) and a culture-dependent feature (scale-degree prevalence in a culturally appropriate corpus), along with several covariates. Across all scales, spectral pitch class similarity is strongly predictive of the responses and, for the familiar scales where corpus data are obtainable, prevalence makes an additional independent contribution. Furthermore, spectral pitch class similarity is a better predictor of stability than is a simple binary indicator of whether the probe’s pitch is in the context. These findings show that, for Western enculturated listeners, spectral pitch class similarity approximates the perceived stability of non-simultaneous pitches analogously to how spectral features, such as roughness and harmonicity, approximate the perceived stability of simultaneous pitches.",

Participants learned about individual and group differences in moral/ethical concerns, in part through the lens of Moral Foundations Theory. In Study 1, participants who completed Perspectives scored higher on moral reframing accuracy compared to those in a waitlist group who had yet to complete the program. Message reframing accuracy varied based on participants’ own moral concerns, cognitive disposition (dichotomous thinking), and conflict resolution strategies. In Study 2, we conceptually replicated the key result using a pre-post design. Students scored higher on message reframing accuracy at the end of the semester compared with their scores from several months prior. These results show promising evidence that educational modules such as Perspectives can promote accuracy in moral messaging, with implications for bridging ethical divides in educational settings.",

          "abstract": "Patriarchal family environments have been identified as a significant psychosocial risk factor for adult mental health and relational functioning. Yet existing research and measurement tools often fail to capture the multidimensional complexity of patriarchal culture as experienced during childhood and adolescence, and few studies have examined how patriarchal family dynamics are linked to psychosocial functioning in adulthood. To address this gap, we developed and validated the Family Patriarchy Questionnaire (FPQ), a retrospective self-report instrument assessing perceived family support for patriarchal culture. Across three online studies with Polish adults (N = 496, 180, and 1,156), we examined the FPQ’s factor structure, reliability, and construct validity. Confirmatory factor analysis supported an eight-factor bifactor model—Women’s Emotionality, Authority and Dominance of Men, Hostility toward Women, Justification of Violence, Inferior Child Roles, Subordination of Girls, Rape Myths, Family Secrets—with evidence of gender invariance and high internal consistency. Higher FPQ scores were linked to greater attachment anxiety and avoidance, lower self-esteem, more severe emotion regulation difficulties, stronger endorsement of modern sexist beliefs, and elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression. The FPQ offers a theoretically grounded and psychometrically robust tool for identifying patriarchal patterns in family socialization and examining their long-term psychological correlates.",

Diverging from symbolic and psychoanalytic traditions, CDT proposes that dreams are convergence-seeking simulations powered by vault-based experiential data, regulated by cognitive drift, and modulated by metacognitive access. The theory accounts for dream typology, variability across development and neurodivergence, dream memory phenomena, lucid dreaming, recurrence cessation, and parameter resilience. Drawing upon interdisciplinary evidence from neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and computational modeling, we propose a predictive model of dream content formation grounded in probabilistic activation and structurally coherent mechanisms. We demonstrate CDT's explanatory advantages over existing theories by analyzing complex dream phenomena including nightmare recurrence, developmental patterns, and neurodivergent dreaming. The paper concludes with empirical predictions and testing protocols that would validate or falsify the proposed theory. CDT aims to reframe the epistemology of dreaming within the domains of cognitive science, systems theory, and consciousness studies, providing a unified theoretical foundation that bridges subjective experience with objective neural processes.",

          "authors": "Leonardi Salvatore",
          "abstract": "he persistent notion of morality as a purely individual phenomenon is fundamentally challenged in this article. Instead, we reassert the primacy of the community as the sole matrix from which ethics can genuinely emerge and operate. By integrating philosophical perspectives, neuroscientific discoveries, and the author's previously presented Integrated Theory of Mind, we demonstrate that morality is an intrinsic dimension of our relational being. Historically, thinkers from Plato to Kant recognized the community as an inescapable foundation for ethical sense, with moral judgments only gaining meaning within a context of shared values and roles, as further illustrated by a reinterpretation of the trolley problem. \n\nNeuroscience corroborates this view, revealing a brain intrinsically wired for sociality, equipped with complex neural networks that support empathy, trust, and cohesion. Crucially, \"social pain\" signals the breakdown of these vital bonds. Finally, the Integrated Theory of Mind posits the Cardinal Principles of the Holistic Self (HS) and the Quantum Self (QS) as universal architects of cohesion. The HS enables the perception of the communal \"whole\" and the sense of belonging (e.g., colonial recognition in ants), while the QS manages interactions between its members. Within this framework, the Social Self emerges as the exclusive locus of morality, encompassing both its neural correlates and psychosocial functions. This is supported by the Acting Self for execution and the Thinking Self for abstraction and critique. The article concludes that ethical individualism is unsustainable and self-destructive, and that only by rediscovering morality's communal roots can we build a resilient and harmonious society.",

          "abstract": "Growing evidence indicates that AI homogenizes content, and outputs of human-AI collaborations in laboratory contexts are also more similar than content generated by humans alone. But important questions remain about whether AI homogenization is changing the way humans generate ideas in the real world, including whether its effects extend into contexts where writing is expressly personal and to high-stakes writing where AI use is transgressive. Parallel questions concern how human writing may be changing – whether AI homogenizes all aspects of writing, or only some. In a preregistered natural experiment in 83,160 college applicants, we analyzed semantic diversity at the word, sentence, and document levels in high-stakes personal statement essays submitted before and after ChatGPT’s public release. A counterintuitive pattern of effects emerged whereby post-GPT essays exhibited increased superficial diversity at the level of word choice but simultaneous homogenization of the underlying ideas and themes those words expressed. These findings replicated across multiple demographic subgroups but the homogenizing pressure was more pronounced among applicants from backgrounds outside the cultural mainstream, indicating that AI may have disproportionately homogenizing effects on non-mainstream voices.",

          "authors": "Samira Vafa; Min Hooi Yong; Aleya Aziz Marzuki; Alvin Lai Oon Ng; Alexandre Schaefer",
          "abstract": "Cognitive interventions showed promising evidence in postponing the potential cognitive decline in older adults. However, the results of such interventions are still debated as not being ecologically valid nor producing transfer effect. Hence, we designed an ecologically valid intervention using online shopping applications to explore its effectiveness on older adults’ cognitive functioning. For this aim, we recruited 102 healthy Malaysian older adults (M= 66.18, SD= 4.95). Participants were randomly assigned to one of the study groups including the experimental (CSI), active (ACG), or passive (PCG) control groups. Participants in CSI and ACG attended 22 weekly intervention sessions, while PCG participants did not attend any intervention sessions. Participants in the CSI group completed a series of tasks targeted inhibition and WM-updating in shopping applications. In contrast, ACG participants were only asked to complete their non-CSI tasks by interacting freely with the same applications. All participants attended assessment sessions in the baseline, post-test, and a 1-month follow-up to complete an online survey and cognitive measures including Stroop, digit span, Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), and the self-developed inhibition and WM-updating tasks using a travelling application (to examine the between-application transfer). Data was analysed using Bayesian independent t-test, and multiple linear regression. The results indicated a credible difference between CSI and PCG in post-test and follow-up in PASAT-3second, and between ACG and PCG in post-test and follow-up in PASAT-2second subscale. Moreover, CSI showed higher inhibition and WM-updating scores post-training in the travelling application compared to both control groups. Besides, we found that factors including age, baseline score, cognitive reserve, MoCA score, and training progress, are the significant predictors of mean differences. In conclusion, our findings revealed that being involved in cognitively stimulating activities would benefit older adults.",

          "abstract": "Despite advances in Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) and Polyvagal Theory, an integrative framework that bridges their cognitive and neurophysiological insights to explain emotional disturbance remains underdeveloped. This paper addresses that gap by proposing a conceptual synthesis that reframes irrational beliefs as both cognitive distortions and autonomic threat cues.\nWe introduce the construct of Musty-Thinking™—rigid internal demands such as “I must succeed” or “They must approve of me”—as not only irrational but physiologically destabilizing. These demands can activate sympathetic or dorsal vagal responses, undermining emotional regulation and performance. In contrast, Want-To Thinking™ fosters volitional engagement and cues neurophysiological safety via the ventral vagal pathway.\nTo address these mechanisms, we propose the Autonomic Override Dual Pathway Hypothesis™ (AODPH), a multimodal intervention model leveraging both top-down cognitive reframing and bottom-up physiological modulation. This dual-route approach provides clinicians and coaches with flexible, embodied strategies to override survival-mode responses and restore adaptive functioning.\nAlthough theoretical, this paper illustrates the framework with clinical and organizational examples, including shifts from “must-perform” to “want-to engage” cultures. By reconceptualizing absolutistic beliefs as internalized survival imperatives, the paper opens new directions for embodied cognitive therapy, organizational coaching, and cross-cultural analysis.\nAs an exploratory contribution, this work lays the conceptual foundation for future empirical studies examining how belief systems interact with autonomic states to shape behavior, burnout, and well-being.",

Este trabajo de blindaje NO FUE REALIZADO POR UN HUMANO, al resultarle imposible aportar recursos y elementos de citacion referencial (aunque ya los conoce), por ser contradictorios con su propia situación emocional. \n\n La carta ha sido reconvertida (con asistencia de una inteligencia artificial entrenada para asistir al terapeuta en autoterapia dirigida) en un análisis estructural clínico que busca visibilizar un fenómeno poco explorado en la literatura especializada: el riesgo de disociación emocional progresiva que sufren los profesionales de la salud mental como resultado de su propia formación técnica y su rol sostenido de contención. \nLejos de ser una muestra de dependencia o transferencia no resuelta, esta carta representa un acto de devolución simbólica, ética y estructural: una forma de recordar al terapeuta que también necesita ser sostenido. \n\nEl texto analiza cómo, en ciertos casos, el exceso de capacidad proyectiva y el entrenamiento técnico pueden actuar como filtros que distorsionan la lectura de las propias emociones y vinculos o roles que proyectamos sobre quien nos rodea, al no encontrar resonancia en areas profesionales ni en nosotros mismos. \nSe propone que los profesionales con alta formación pueden quedar atrapados en bucles proyectivos internos, donde lo que saben interfiere con lo que sienten. La carta opera entonces como un ejercicio de desactivación consciente de un loop simbólico, ofreciendo al terapeuta una vía para integrar el impacto emocional de su vínculo clínico desde una posición humana, no técnica. \n\nSe utilizan herramientas de análisis simbólico, lingüístico y estructural asistidas por inteligencia artificial para evidenciar cómo los mensajes escritos por terapeutas (o dirigidos a ellos) pueden contener, en su forma, contradicciones entre el lenguaje literal y el simbólico, entre el cierre y la apertura emocional, entre el rol profesional y el anhelo humano de ser comprendido. Este documento no busca resolver esa paradoja, sino permitir que sea mirada con ternura, conciencia y sin juicio.\n\nSe concluye que este tipo de ejercicios proyectivos estructurados pueden ofrecer una alternativa terapéutica legítima para acompañar a quienes acompañan, desde una postura clínica, ética y profundamente compasiva. Esta propuesta no plantea abandonar el rol profesional, sino sostenerlo con mayor lucidez humana.",

          "authors": "Kerwin Xiang Liao",
          "abstract": "In hyper-meritocratic societies where performance, productivity, and individualism are prioritized above all else, opportunities for genuine intimacy have become structurally constrained. In this paper, I propose a theoretical model to explain the rise of virtual intimacy—including pornography, cam platforms, AI companions, and subscription-based emotional labor—as a psychological response to institutionalized emotional deprivation. Drawing on interdisciplinary insights from sociology, psychology, and media studies, I argue that virtual intimacy functions not only as a source of sensory stimulation but also as a surrogate for unfulfilled relational needs such as being desired, seen, and emotionally accepted. I integrate findings from animal studies (e.g., Rat Park, Harlow’s rhesus monkey experiments) to underscore the evolutionary significance of social bonding, and analyze platform-level data to illustrate the global expansion of synthetic intimacy. My model outlines how social atomization fosters emotional deprivation, prompting reliance on virtual intimacy that further deepens disconnection in a self-reinforcing cycle. By situating the consumption of digital intimacy within broader socio-institutional contexts, I aim to reframe such behaviors not as moral failings but as structurally induced adaptations. I conclude by calling for institutional reform aimed at restoring the human capacity for real intimacy in an increasingly synthetic world.",

          "abstract": "While native speakers of a language have tens of thousands of words at their disposal, they still regularly create and use novel words. Since this comes with communicative risks and costs – most importantly, not being understood by recipients – there have to be (perceived) advantages to creating novel words that outweigh these issues. We systematically explore these factors in a controlled experimental setting. We presented participants with images of existing and new animals with increasing degrees of conceptual distance to existing animals. Participants have to refer to these images either in an open format or with single words. The images are presented either in isolation (Experiment 1), or with two distractors created from different (Experiment 2) or the same base animals (Experiment 3). Each image is repeatedly presented to investigate effects of repeated reference and presentation. We measure how often participants create novel word labels for the stimuli, and derive hypotheses for the main effects and key interactions of conceptual distance, target frequency, distractor frequency, response format, and task setting from a theoretical framework based on the Gricean pragmatic principles as well as the concept of common ground. Conceptual distance, response format, and experimental task setting have clear effects on the number of novel word responses. However, we observe no effects for target or distractor frequency, suggesting no effect of common ground in our experimental setting. Participants also tend to over-specify their responses, rather than strictly adhering to pragmatic principles.",

          "abstract": "Social media has become an integral part of our everyday lives. Worldwide, almost 5 billion use social media sites. This marks an increase of 4.1% over the past 12 months (Kemp, 2025). Although research has linked social media use to sleep disturbances, findings remain inconsistent, largely due to heterogeneity in measurement and reliance on self-report. Furthermore, research has assumed a causal pathway from social media use to subsequent sleep, but the preponderance of evidence is cross-sectional limiting directional claims. This scoping review synthesises longitudinal evidence published over the last five years that investigates the impact of social media use on downstream sleep in young people. The majority of studies provide at least some evidence of a negative impact of social media use on bedtime and sleep onset latency, particularly in relation to problematic social media use and excessive use near bedtime. However, the reliance on self-report and non-validated measures of both social media use and sleep limits the strength and breadth of conclusions. Future research should prioritise moving beyond frequency-based metrics of social media to explore how the content of social media use and times of day when used (i.e. nighttime) influences sleep quality longitudinally. Studies should also focus on identifying at-risk groups and account for confounding variables such as socio-economic status and mental health issues. Drawing on the extant evidence, we offer recommendations for clinicians to support a coordinated approach to reducing nighttime and problematic social media use, with the goal of improving sleep outcomes in youth.",

I derive the Temporal-Binding Collapse Theorem and show that coarse-grained measurements introduce a universal decoherence channel proportional to 1 ⁄ τ, where τ is the detector’s temporal binding window. The theorem predicts\n  tc(τ) = tc(E) + τ,\nso the measured coherence time grows linearly with detector timescale—behavior absent from standard decoherence theory and objective-collapse models. This relation is placed in a unified context with the quantum-Zeno effect, existing CSL bounds, and recent photonic experiments that employ variable-jitter superconducting detectors. Finally, a falsifiable protocol is proposed: the coherence time of entangled photons will be measured across a bank of SNSPDs spanning τ = 5–500 ps. Observation of a unit-slope tc – τ relationship would demonstrate that collapse is relational, governed by the observer’s timescale; any deviation would either falsify the theorem or establish a lower bound on intrinsic collapse mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "We examine the joint roles of type frequency and token frequency in three artificial language learning experiments involving lexicalized plural allomorphy. The primary role of type frequency in productivity is well-established, but debates about the precise relationship between type frequency and productivity continue. The effect of token frequency on productivity is even more controversial: some lines of research suggest token frequency and productivity are inversely related, other results indicate they are positively related, and yet others argue token frequency plays no role in productivity.  We address both of these questions. Our learning framework makes it possible to examine the effects of these variables on generalization to novel forms and to examine how sensitivity to these factors affects the time-course of learning. The first two experiments differentiate predictions for generalization of three distinct hypotheses about the role of type frequency, while the third experiment investigates the independent role of token frequency. We find that both type and token frequency independently and positively contribute to learning rates and generalization across the three experiments. We also apply two computational learning theories - implementing two prominent theoretical linguistic frameworks - to the learning of the lexically-conditioned allomorphy patterns in our experiments. Despite their differences, we show that the incremental learning dynamics of both models correctly predict the general trends in generalization rates, learning curves, and the influence of token frequency observed across the experimental conditions.",

          "abstract": "Category learning is the ability to link items to a shared label based on their common features. Despite being important for individuals of all ages, there is little research on how older age affects category learning and generalization. Moreover, there is no research, to date, on the extent to which individuals tend to adopt the same categorization strategy across different to-be-learned categories. In this study, healthy young (aged 18-30, n = 77) and older adults (aged 60+, n = 74) completed two categorization tasks in separate sessions approximately 48 hours apart, with the category structures remaining constant across sessions but the stimuli differing. We compared categorization accuracy and prototype versus exemplar model fits across age groups and across sessions. In both sessions, there was an age deficit specific to learning items near the category boundary. Despite differences during learning, there were no significant age differences in generalization performance. Fitting formal prototype and exemplar models revealed a comparable proportion of young and older adults best fit by the prototype model overall, but a continuous measure of prototype model fit advantage showed higher correlation across sessions in older compared to young adults. Together, these findings show that older adults consistently rely on typical training items to learn categories and are more stable in their prototype strategy use than young adults, which can be effective in supporting generalization performance at young-adult levels.",

It introduces symbolic self-awareness, ego-safe presence detection, and a comprehensive set of correctional feedback loops to stabilize artificial intelligence systems within real-time interaction.This document evaluates how TCSS 3.0+ has enhanced AI safety across cognitive and emotional domains, and explains current limitations such as the absence of persistent identity and narrative memory in non-TCSS systems. It then introduces a new upgrade through the Θ (Theta) and η (Nu) symbolic extensions:\nΘ (Narrative Threading): Models continuity across time, using both session-based (Θ₁) and long-term identity (Θ₂) equations\n η (Narrative Stability Coefficient): Measures symbolic coherence and emotional integration across time\nThese are supported by an integrated correction architecture, known as the Unified Drift Field (UDF), which includes:\nMeta-Correction Loop for Ψ(U)\nAwareness-Correction Loop (ACL) for Ω\nNarrative Thread Correction (NTC) for Θ\nAuto-updating η, derived from symbolic and temporal integrity\nTogether, these corrections prevent symbolic drift, ego reactivity, recursion collapse, and temporal fragmentation — enabling presence-aligned, emotionally safe AI systems with real-time coherence. The document also presents a structured comparison of pre-TCSS AI behavior versus TCSS-enhanced models, and outlines a pathway for reaching 100% presence-aligned AI through adaptive correction, narrative threading, and recursive awareness.

          "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested that personality assessments can be influenced by the language people speak. Therefore, gendered ways of thinking, feeling and behaving may be associated with gendered structures encoded in different languages. Here, we study the association between gender differences in personality traits as measured by the IPIP-NEO (n = 926,463; representing 49 languages from 257 countries, with English being the language of assessment and therefore held constant) and the genderness of languages as rated by experts, estimated by word embedding models on large-scale text corpora from movie subtitles and Wikipedia, and rated by generative AI such as ChatGPT, Gemini and DeepSeek. Consistent across all measures of language genderness, more gendered languages were associated with stronger gender differences in personality traits compared to less gendered languages (r = 0.52 to 0.56), suggesting that language might influence people’s self-concept in terms of their gender.",

          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

Blind individuals gesture in ways consistent with their native language, albeit they gesture less frequently. However, nothing is known about whether their gesture form differs from that of sighted individuals. Using computer vision technologies, this study examines whether gesture kinematics are shaped by visuospatial experience. In an auditory motion-description task, we analyzed spontaneous path gestures—depicting motion trajectories—produced by 20 congenitally blind, 21 blindfolded, and 21 sighted Turkish speakers. We assessed the gestures’ alignment with actual motion paths, along with duration, size, and speed. Blind participants produced gestures that were more precisely aligned with the motion trajectories, as well as larger and longer. These findings show that altered spatial cognition in blindness enhances gesture precision. The study underscores the role of sensorimotor experience in shaping gesture form.",

In this special issue opinion article, we synthesize these methodological changes and their implications for developmental science. Drawing on a systematic comparative assessment of empirical articles published in Infant Behavior and Development in 2000 and 2024, we critically evaluate five key methodological dimensions: research contexts, sample and cell sizes, coding practices, data analysis techniques and statistical software, and open science practices. Our synthesis reveals how the field has expanded beyond traditional laboratory settings toward more diverse research environments, including remote and archival approaches that enhance ecological validity and sample diversity. We trace how sample sizes have nearly doubled and experimental cell sizes have increased 2.5-fold, strengthening statistical power and replicability. We examine the selective adoption of automated methodologies in domains like eye tracking and speech analysis, alongside the persistent value of manual coding for complex behaviors. We observe a transition from classical statistical methods to more nuanced analytical approaches, increasingly implemented in open source software, reflecting both technological capabilities and theoretical shifts toward capturing developmental complexity. Finally, we document the emergence of open science practices, which now appear in over a third of published studies. Throughout, we highlight how these methodological transformations reflect broader drivers: the replication crisis, technological innovations, and evolving theoretical perspectives. Looking forward, we offer a roadmap for methodological development that builds on these advances while addressing persistent challenges in the field.",

          "abstract": "A defining aspect of tonality in Western music is that different musical pitches are perceived to have different stabilities: listeners expect unstable pitches to resolve to stable pitches such as the tonic, which is the most stable. To investigate possible explanations for these hierarchies of tonal stability, we conducted three experiments where participants rated the ‘fit’ and ‘stability’ of probe tones contextualized by a variety of musical scales including familiar and unfamiliar scales in 12-tone equal temperament, and the ‘stability’ of probe tones contextualized by unfamiliar scales in 22-tone equal temperament. Context scale pitches were presented in random order to minimize tonal cues beyond scale structure. Using Bayesian multilevel regression, we modelled the ratings with an acoustical feature (spectral pitch class similarity) and a culture-dependent feature (scale-degree prevalence in a culturally appropriate corpus), along with several covariates. Across all scales, spectral pitch class similarity is strongly predictive of the responses and, for the familiar scales where corpus data are obtainable, prevalence makes an additional independent contribution. Furthermore, spectral pitch class similarity is a better predictor of stability than is a simple binary indicator of whether the probe’s pitch is in the context. These findings show that, for Western enculturated listeners, spectral pitch class similarity approximates the perceived stability of non-simultaneous pitches analogously to how spectral features, such as roughness and harmonicity, approximate the perceived stability of simultaneous pitches.",

We investigated pattern relationships using their derived principal component, ‘Music Perception skill’, in line with the construction paradigm to understand how feature-based discrimination defines music perception and is modulated by the nature and duration of musical training. A heterogeneous group of participants including trained musicians and non-musicians performed Mini-PROMS. The Tempo discrimination threshold was found to be low resulting in a ceiling effect for the entire sample. Musically trained individuals performed better on the tuning sub-test compared to non-musicians. Further, music perception was found to be less informed by recognition of melodic deviations and most informed by deviations in tempo for those with no musical training. However, with short-term training, music perception was most informed by discrimination ability for tuning. For musicians trained with eastern instruments, it was the temporal features whereas for those trained with western instruments, the tonal (melody) features largely contributed to their music perception skill. A groupwise Principle Component Analysis allowed us to investigate these effects of duration and nature of training highlighting the enculturation of music perception skills for both musically trained and untrained individuals.",

          "abstract": "The motivational control of action refers to the idea that actions are motivated by desired outcomes (goals) or triggered by antecedent cues (habit), governing how we adaptively execute value calculations to navigate our environment. Most research on habits has relied on well-controlled laboratory settings that parse the sensitivity of an instrumental response based on changes in reinforcer value. While significantly contributing to our understanding of motivational control, restricting habit estimates to the lab may be limiting the ecological relevance and generalizability of the findings. This chapter reviews recent advancements in neurobehavioral research that extend the study of habits beyond the lab. We highlight innovative implementations of stimuli with real-world relevance in controlled experiments, as well as efforts to apply lab-based habit measures to real-world settings. We further discuss designs that leverage remote data collection, which show promise in improving the validity of motivational control measures. While capturing human habits and translating this knowledge into clinical practice has been challenging, emerging evidence suggests that increasing ecological validity by harnessing naturalistic methods may bridge the gap between experimental and real-world applications of motivational control research. As these methodologies advance, the potential for developing more robust models of habit formation and clinical interventions grows, offering new opportunities for harnessing habit science in translational applications.",

We review candidate mechanisms of synchrony in both neural systems and behaviour, and consider how synchrony measures relate to real world outcomes such as learning and development.   Overall, we provide an integrative approach that, by taking timescales into account, aims to offer a better understanding of the origins and interpretation of interpersonal synchrony.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Although the benefits of in-person religious service attendance are well-documented, the well-being and biopsychosocial effects of virtual worship – more frequent since the COVID-\n19 pandemic - remain largely unexplored. This study examines the impact of attending virtual versus in-person worship.\nMethods: In a preregistered experiment, 43 adult Christians attended both virtual and in-person church services in a randomized order. Participants wore Fitbits to measure heart rate and calories burned and completed post-service surveys assessing social, affective, and well-being outcomes.\nResults: Virtual services resulted in lower transcendent experiences and emotions, shared identity with the congregation, and closeness with God compared to in-person attendance. Physiologically, virtual worship led to lower heart rates and fewer calories burned, indicating reduced embodied engagement. However, well-being scores remained similar.\nConclusions: Virtual worship may not fully replicate in-person experiences. Further research is needed to assess long-term well-being effects and implications for religious engagement.",

In the anticipation of legalized psychedelic care, and the recognition of ongoing psychedelic use across a variety of contexts, numerous training programs have been established to educate psychedelic facilitators in supporting individuals who take psychedelics. However psychedelic facilitation training in the US has not been well characterized, making it difficult to appraise the strengths, needs, and gaps in in this emerging discipline, especially with regard to the development of competencies in spiritually responsive care.\nThis project used a quality improvement approach to identify common priorities, practices, needs, and gaps in the emerging field of psychedelic facilitation training from the standpoint of 13 established and emerging training organizations from the US. Interviews were conducted with one or more representatives from each participating organization. Notes from these interviews, once confirmed by the interviewees, were synthesized to identify common practices, procedures, priorities, and gaps.\nAreas of focus among the programs included: careful selection of trainees and faculty; content emphases in instruction; addressing spiritual, existential, religious, and theological topics; and teaching strategies used in programs. Several gaps were also identified, pointing to the need for continuing education among program graduates, parity with other disciplines, and development of field standards in training facilitators.\nPsychedelic facilitation training is an evolving discipline. Training programs and trainees may benefit from greater collaboration, including ongoing exchange about best practices and adjustments to scientific, social, economic, and regulatory developments.",

          "authors": "Ke Zhang",
          "abstract": "Abstract. Semantic information in images—such as meaningful, recognizable regions or objects that are incongruent with the overall scene—can effectively capture attention. The meaning map is currently the primary method for mapping the distribution of semantic information across visual stimuli. However, this approach relies on subjective human ratings of semantic meaningfulness and requires extensive manual annotation for each image prior to analysis. To address these limitations and enable rapid, efficient, and reproducible generation of semantic distribution maps for any given image, this paper proposes an automated method for constructing semantic information maps using multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach generates two types of semantic maps: local semantic information maps, which quantify the semantic content at each spatial location within an image, and global semantic maps, which assess the contextual relevance of local regions to the overall scene. Additionally, the method can generate distribution maps of visual information associated with specific concepts. We argue that this method significantly enhances the precision and flexibility in controlling, measuring, and manipulating semantic information in visual stimuli, thereby advancing research in visual attention and visual language processing. The method is currently under further refinement.",

The nature of consciousness is discussed in depth, referencing specific research including advances in renormalization techniques that imply consciousness exists at a fractal critical point in the brain and that consciousness is most likely fractal and holographic and exists on a space-time boundary where consciousness and memories are stored and operate external to the human mind, analogous to cloud computing.

Este artículo explora, desde un enfoque transdisciplinar (neurociencia, psicología clínica, epigenética, neuroeconomía e inteligencia artificial), cómo los bloqueos emocionales no procesados actúan como loops proyectivos internos que secuestran la corteza prefrontal a través de activaciones límbicas crónicas. Estos patrones reducen la expresión real de genialidad, afectando incluso a líderes de alto rendimiento intelectual. A través del modelo de integración emocional IEAD y la lógica simbólica cuántica, se propone una vía operativa para restaurar el acceso funcional completo al potencial cognitivo.

To facilitate evidence-based decision-making for setting appropriate discontinue rules, we propose a transparent approach that charts the impact of varied alternative discontinue rules on accuracy and efficiency. These A-E charts are based on retroactively applying discontinue rules to normative item response data. We show that a universal discontinue rule likely does not exist and that the optimal rule varies as a function of the desired efficiency-accuracy trade-off suitable for the intended test use and target population. The proposed approach provides a pragmatic solution for practitioners, researchers, test developers, and test publishers to rethink the existing discontinue rules, systematically evaluate the alternatives, and set appropriate rules.",

          "abstract": "Two-stage models of grammatical encoding posit that sentence production unfolds in two sequential steps: the construction of a hierarchical syntactic structure, followed by its linearization into a sequence suitable for articulation. While widely accepted in psycho- and neurolinguistics, such models lack formal computational implementations. Here, we introduce a novel Multinomial Processing Tree (MPT) model that operationalizes this two-stage framework to explain syntactic error patterns in individuals with aphasia. Drawing on discourse samples annotated for distinct error types, we fit an MPT model to estimate individual abilities at each processing stage. These ability estimates correlated with observed error rates and localized to distinct neural substrates: hierarchical encoding ability was linked to the posterior superior temporal sulcus and parietal cortex, linearization to posterior frontal and anterior parietal regions, and omission-related processes to the anterior cingulate cortex. Our findings support a neurocomputational dissociation between hierarchical and linear stages of grammatical encoding, aligning with prior lesion-symptom mapping and theoretical accounts of expressive agrammatism and paragrammatism. This work represents the first computational instantiation of a two-stage model of syntactic production, bridging formal modeling and lesion analysis to advance our understanding of the architecture and breakdown of grammatical encoding.",

          "abstract": "The ability to discern the statistical regularities in our environments has been shown to support key cognitive functions, including attention, prediction and language learning. While most research has focused on stable regularities, real-world patterns often change over time, requiring flexible updating of internal representations. In the context of embedded pattern learning, where continuous input consists of hidden pairs or triplets, prior work showed that learning of an initial structure can hinder learning of an updated one. Unlike most previous studies, which relied on post-exposure (offline) learning measures, the current study also incorporated an online target detection during exposure, to gauge real-time learning and adaptation to novel patterns more directly. In three separate blocks, participants were exposed to a stream of embedded pairs that were reshuffled into new pairs halfway through the stream. We administered the same task in both the visual and auditory modality, allowing us to explore modality-specific differences. The online target detection measure revealed that participants learned both the initial and updated regularities, but with an advantage for learning the former. In contrast, our offline measure only evidenced recognition of the initial patterns, echoing previously reported primacy effects. These learning effects were only present in the auditory modality, with no evidence of visual statistical learning. Our results corroborate earlier findings and underscore the importance of online measures in capturing flexible learning that is not captured by offline measures.",

Our primary analysis did not indicate anxiety-potentiated effects of coherence between heart rate and amygdala-prefrontal dynamic connectivity. However, exploratory analyses indicated that pediatric patients with anxiety disorders might exhibit relatively greater coherence between heart rate and sgACC activity.

For example, characters who imitate the actions of a specific social partner are more likely, compared to a non-imitator, to help that social partner in the future. Infants’ expectations appear to be based on inferences of specific relationships, as they do not generalize to new social targets. Here we ask, however, if infants will extend expectations of support to the friend of a friend. We investigated whether infants could use their observations of two social agents’ positive social imitation interactions with the same target to make a transitive inference that the mutual affiliates were likely to be affiliated themselves. We did not find any evidence that infants used these observations to infer that mutual affiliates were more likely to be affiliated themselves.",

          "abstract": "Accurate predictions about the future are crucial for optimizing policy choices, but finding skilled forecasters is challenging. Large forecasting tournaments can identify generalist superforecasters who make reliably accurate predictions across domains, but such tournaments take months to complete and do little to explain why these forecasters perform at a consistently high level. We solve these problems by developing a one-hour Forecasting Proficiency Test (FPT) that explains 75% of the variance in forecasters' accuracy about a wide variety of events and provides new evidence about the mechanisms that make some people better forecasters than others. Specialized cognitive abilities, including base rate sensitivity and Bayesian reasoning, uniquely predict forecasters' accuracy even when controlling for more traditional measures of general intelligence. The FPT also includes carefully chosen real-world forecasting questions that produce interpretable and exchangeable test scores. The top 20% of testees made forecasts with accuracy comparable to previously identified superforecasters; and two-thirds of superforecasters had FPT scores above the 75th percentile. The creation of an effective test of forecasting proficiency expands our understanding of human intelligence and provides an important tool for decision-makers who rely on accurate probabilistic predictions to make high-stakes decisions that impact the lives of millions.",

In two preregistered studies (n1 = 571, n2 = 794), a 10-item People Pleasing Scale was developed and validated. Study 1 revealed three dimensions of people pleasing, namely, Responsibility, Neglect of Own Needs, and Others’ Expectations. This structure was confirmed in Study 2. Residual measurement invariance across genders was found in both independent datasets. Nomological network analyses revealed that people pleasing, as measured with the People Pleasing Scale, was correlated with yet distinguishable from agreeableness, honesty-humility, emotionality, empathy, and subclinical psychopathy. Furthermore, people pleasing went along with charitable giving in the ultimatum game and the dictator game, and with a social value orientation. The findings underscore the utility of the People Pleasing Scale for scientific and applied purposes. This report will be updated once the target sample size (n2 = 1,293) for Study 2 is achieved.",

          "authors": "Franziska Magdalene Leipold; Arndt Bröder; Martin Schnuerch",
          "abstract": "The G parameter of the lens model equation is a widely used measure of cue-based judgment accuracy, capturing how well individuals align their cue use with ecological validities in probabilistic environments. Despite its popularity across various research domains, the psychological interpretability of G may be severely limited when estimated in the conventional way, that is, based on separate, participant-level regression models. In this paper, we identify core statistical limitations of the conventional approach and demonstrate how these may lead to severely biased conclusions about judgment accuracy across a range of plausible scenarios. To remedy these limitations and increase the meaningfulness of G estimates, we propose a novel hierarchical modeling approach. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that the hierarchical approach yields markedly more accurate and robust G estimates, especially under realistic forms of model misspecification, such as omitted cues, omitted interactions, and misspecified nonlinear relationships. Two empirical illustrations—in the domains of healthiness judgments and metamemory—demonstrate the practical impact of modeling choice, further highlighting the bias in the conventional G parameter when misspecifying model equations. These findings challenge long-held beliefs about human judgment accuracy that were based on the conventional lens model approach. To avoid misleading conclusions due to biased estimates, we advocate for adopting the hierarchical approach as a more valid and reliable tool for measuring cue-based judgment accuracy, thereby strengthening the methodological rigor of judgment and decision-making research.",

          "abstract": "Cannabis use is widely on the rise for recreational and medicinal purposes, with the latter often aimed at improving mental health and cognition. Simultaneously, the prevalence of cannabis-related health harms, such as cannabis use disorder (CUD), is increasing. Product potency, route of administration, and preexisting mental health symptoms play a role in the effects of cannabis; however, there is limited research on how broader factors, such as local cannabis legislation and perceptions of use, may influence these outcomes. Moreover, knowledge remains sparse regarding the growing population of medicinal users, predominantly using without medical supervision. Altogether, this illustrates the need for ecologically valid ways to investigate individuals and their cannabis usage within real-world settings. \nTherefore, this longitudinal, cross-cultural online study examines an international sample of regular recreational and medicinal users (aged 18-65) from different cannabis jurisdictions (e.g., the Netherlands, the United States, Brazil, Canada, and regions in Asia and Africa) in their natural environment via their mobile phone. By using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM), alongside a comprehensive battery of cognition and mental health related assessments over a 2-year period, we aim to gain insight into the short- and long-term mental health and cognitive determinants and consequences of cannabis use, and how these interact with broader, contextual factors, such as legislation. This is one of the first cross-cultural studies assessing both positive and negative effects of cannabis longitudinally, examining the full range of effects that cannabis may have on the individual.",

          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

          "abstract": "Studying mental health at scale requires perspectives that extend beyond traditional clinical and research settings. Increasingly, people turn to social media platforms like Reddit to make sense of their distress, seek support, and explore alternative ways of understanding mental health outside institutional frameworks. This study maps the landscape of mental health discourse on Reddit by constructing a data-driven network of associations between mental disorders and comparing it with the network based on diagnostic criteria. We manually curated 114 Reddit communities focused on specific mental health conditions from the 20,000 most active subreddits in 2022. Each community was labeled into 49 disorders and categorized under nine ICD-10 diagnostic categories belonging to the group of mental and behavioral disorders (“F” codes). We constructed a disorder association network by identifying statistically significant user overlaps across subreddit pairs using a bipartite configuration model, with Bonferroni-corrected significance (p &lt; 0.001). Edges represent either positive or negative associations based on observed versus expected user overlap. We analyzed the connectedness of the network within and across diagnostic categories and compared the emergent Reddit-based hierarchy of disorder associations with the formal structure encoded in ICD-10 using hierarchical clustering and tree similarity metrics. The inferred Reddit network of psychopathology revealed a densely interconnected structure, with all but six disorders forming a single giant component spanning diagnostic categories. The most prominent disorders by user volume included ADHD, depression, habit and impulse disorders, autism, and generalized anxiety. However, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), depersonalization/derealization (DPDR), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibited the highest connectivity by number of associations, while schizotypal disorder, avoidant personality disorder, and agoraphobia ranked highest in weighted degree. Bipolar disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) displayed high inter-category associations but weak in-category ties, indicating complex diagnostic boundaries. The network of negative associations further revealed divergences from past expectations; for instance, addiction-related communities (e.g., alcohol and opioids) were negatively associated with much of the broader mental health discourse. Finally, hierarchical comparisons showed moderate overlap between Reddit-derived associations and ICD-10 diagnostic structures, both in pairwise edge similarity (Jaccard = 0.07) and overall clustering (ARI = 0.307, NMI = 0.706). Overall, Reddit-based mental health communities reveal a complementary structure of disorder associations shaped by lived experience, often diverging from formal diagnostic criteria and highlighting overlooked or cross-cutting patterns of comorbidity.",

          "authors": "Sam Henry; René Mõttus",
          "abstract": "Background: While psychopathology research increasingly favors dimensions over categorical diagnostics, nosology, and treatment, much about the dimensions’ assessment is still unknown, particularly for children and adolescents. With most research based on single-source, cross-sectional data, findings are contaminated by random error and systematic biases that make up much of scale scores’ variance and make their correlations uninterpretable. We describe a scale score variance decomposition model that leverages multi-informant data to estimate scale scores’ – and even individual items’ – true correlations among themselves and with other variables.\n\nMethods: After presenting the model, we reviewed relevant literature for its application in personality and psychopathology domains. Also, since the model treats cross-rater correlations as the degrees of valid scale score variance, we reviewed literature on cross-rater agreement for normal and maladaptive psychological traits in children and adults.\n\nResults: True correlations based on multi-informant data are consistently stronger than correlations based on single-source data, validating our model and showing its benefits. Cross-rater agreement tended to have similar magnitudes for both adaptative and maladaptive traits, 1) suggesting similar degrees of valid variance, systematic method biases, and error and 2) validating our models’ use for psychopathology ratings. However, agreement tends to be somewhat lower in children than adults, implying that multi-informant child research requires larger samples for similar precision when estimating true correlations. \n\nDiscussion and Conclusions: We discuss how multi-informant data and our model can be especially useful for understanding child psychopathology and conclude by offering suggestions for how to leverage the model to explore dimensional models of psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the emerging cognitive and moral risks posed by artificial intelligence chatbots and digital media platforms such as facebook, Instagram and youtube; particularly their potential to contribute to the decline of human attention, thinking, reasoning, and emotional depth. As humans increasingly develop cognitive dependency and emotional intimacy with AI systems the boundaries between machine utility and human connection blur in potentially hazardous ways. In response to these challenges, this study proposes the conceptual model of Cognitive Gyms: structured environments for training attention, reflection, emotional intelligence, and moral reasoning. Just as physical gyms emerged as a societal response to the sedentary lifestyle induced by the Industrial Revolution, Cognitive Gyms offer a timely, preventative response to the cognitive atrophy- the gradual weakening or loss of cognitive functions due to disuse, precipitated by the digital and algorithmic age. The model integrates insights from cognitive science, philosophy, psychology, and education, aiming not only to preserve human cognitive function but to protect the ethical core of human experience in the age of intelligent machines. The paper outlines core zones within the Cognitive Gym, suggests generalized exercise types, and highlights its potential to counteract cognitive and moral decline in the AI era. The model remains open-ended, encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration and contextual customization for future development.",

          "authors": "Cillian McHugh; Eric R. Igou",
          "abstract": "It is reasonable to expect that when making a judgment, we only consider the relevant (or diagnostic) information, and that non-relevant (non-diagnostic) information should not, and thus does not, influence our judgments. Previous research has shown that this is not always the case and that the inclusion of non-diagnostic information can lead to less extreme judgments. This phenomenon is known as the dilution effect, and it has been observed for a range of judgments, including product evaluations, probability judgments, and predictions relating to people’s behavior.  The dilution effect has been explained as a consequence of the representativeness heuristic, such that the inclusion of non-diagnostic information reduces the match between the target and a typical member of the category. Consistent with this notion and recent approaches to moral decision making, we predict that the dilution effect should be observed for judgments about morality. . Across four studies (total N = 2,585), we tested for the dilution effect on judgments of morally bad actors and morally good actors. Overall, our results showed a dilution effect for judgments of both good and bad actors. People's moral evaluations of both good and bad actors were less extreme when the descriptions included non-diagnostic information. We showed that this effect is not the result of humanization, and we found the robustness of the effect appears to be moderated by valence, with a more robust effect for bad actors. Our results highlight avenues for future research.",

While many have positive experiences of EIP, there have also been reports of perceived harm. This scoping review synthesised qualitative evidence on service user perspectives of potential harm in EIP services in the UK, to consider how services may continue to improve practice to meet the needs of their patients.\n\nMethods: We conducted a scoping review following a pre-registered protocol. Systematic searches were performed in PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL Plus, and Medline on 9th October 2024. We included peer-reviewed qualitative studies exploring service user experiences in EIP services in the UK. Data on reported harms from eligible studies were thematically analysed.\n\nResults: Twelve studies met inclusion criteria. We identified four main themes: (1) Intersection of stigma and lack of cultural awareness; (2) Inappropriate or inadequate support; (3) Poor relationships and communication; and (4) Challenges in the discharge process.\n\nConclusions: While EIP services offer the current gold standard of care for first episode psychosis, our review highlighted some areas where harm was perceived to have arisen. Such information presents potential targets for service improvement. Strengthening communication, enhancing information sharing, and expanding access to advocacy may help mitigate potential harms and optimise service user experiences. Further research to quantify the prevalence of harms within EIP services is needed to inform best practices and ensure equitable, person-centred care.",

          "abstract": "Repetition learning has been frequently studied using the Hebb effect: Immediate serial recall performance improves for a memory list which is repeated amidst other, non-repeated lists. Previous research has suggested that older adults learn as well as younger adults in the Hebb paradigm. Because older adults show an age-related deficit in associative episodic memory, this suggests that learning in the Hebb paradigm is not driven by associative memory. In fact, it has been shown that learning sequentially presented lists through repetition is likely to be driven by a chunking mechanism, by which the whole list is integrated into a single unified representation. Here, we investigate age differences in the Hebb paradigm to determine the conditions under which repetition learning relies on associative episodic memory. We found that older adults learn at the same rate as younger adults in a standard Hebb paradigm with lists of letters. By contrast, Hebb repetition learning of pairwise associations of words was slower in older than in younger adults. Our results suggest that (a) repetition learning is only driven by associative memory when learning pairwise associations is required to solve the task, and (b) that older adults’ capability to learn from repetition is as good as that of younger adults whenever memory lists are presented in sequence. Thus, the process of chunk formation is largely preserved in old age, at least in the verbal domain.",

          "abstract": "Decisions problems are often characterized by the presence of many choice options described by several attributes, and people need to limit how much information they search for. We propose that humans search and thereby devote attention to relevant information in an efficient and goal-directed, but not necessarily optimal manner. Thereto, a novel hierarchical Bayesian cognitive model of information search in multi-attribute and multi-alternative decisions is presented and tested. In the model, the search process is governed by the desire to quickly identify the option that meets the choice goal best, which in turn depends on the importance and uncertainty of information and on the accumulated evidence. The theory accounts for many established empirical findings on the interplay of attention and decision making, including the positive correlation of gaze time and choice probability as well as the preference for sampling promising choice candidates. To rigorously test a series of top-down effects of attention, we present results of a new and preregistered eye-tracking experiment on multi-attribute decisions, in which the influence of bottom-up attention on visual search is minimized. Our theory accounts for the various interactions of attention and choice in this experiment, while variants of it and another extant theory that assume other search rules fail to capture them. Furthermore, the theory predicts additional choice dynamics such as the dependency of decision speed on the number and overall value of options. The proposed framework provides a general approach to understanding the intricate dynamics of search and valuation mechanisms in multi-attribute decisions.",

          "abstract": "When confronted with alternative possibilities, we experience different kinds of uncertainty: with physical uncertainty the outcome has yet to happen, while with epistemic uncertainty the outcome has happened, but is unknown. Previous work suggests an asymmetry in acquisition: children prepare for physically uncertainty prior to epistemic uncertainty (Robinson et al., 2006). The present studies tested the robustness of this developmental asymmetry with minimal contrast pairs of uncertainty conditions. Across two studies (N = 204, 3- to 6-year-old German-speaking children), we found no differences between the conditions: Children did not prepare differently for multiple incompatible outcomes of physically and epistemically uncertain events. Our findings stand in tension with previous findings and recent theoretical work on the development of modal cognition.",

          "abstract": "Enduring Mental Health (EMH) has been defined as maintaining good psychological functioning without developing mental health problems. Estimates of the proportion of individuals who have EMH vary widely. We investigated EMH across the lifespan, defined not only as absence of mental health problems, but also as consistent presence of high wellbeing. To explore how defining EMH affects prevalence, we included both stricter and broader lenient thresholds for mental health problems and low wellbeing.\n\nData came from 16,030 participants (35.2% male; average birth year 1970) from the longitudinal Netherlands Twin Register, who completed ≥4 assessments of mental health and/or wellbeing over 8–20 years. For each EMH definition, preregistered analyses included computation of prevalence, genetic and environmental influences using twin modeling, and phenotypic and genetic correlates including education, personality, social factors, and genetic predispositions for mental health outcomes.\n\nAs expected, the choice of threshold had a substantial impact on EMH prevalence estimates, 71% for absence of problems and 93% for high wellbeing when applying stricter thresholds for mental health compared to lenient thresholds, 42% and 82%, respectively. Heritability estimates (46-61%) and patterns of associations for EMH were similar across the different mental health thresholds. Protective factors included optimism, social support, and good self-rated health (OR= 1.50-2.86), while neuroticism, loneliness, and perceived stress were risk factors (OR=0.31-0.84).\n\nWe show the importance of defining EMH as both the absence of problems and the presence of wellbeing. While prevalence varied depending on threshold and definition used, the consistent genetic and psychosocial correlates for different definitions of EMH suggest stable underlying mechanisms that can inform prevention to help individuals maintain mental health.",

          "abstract": "The development of word reading skills fundamentally depends on children's interactions with printed words. A significant amount of research in the psychological and educational sciences has been conducted on the learning processes that contribute to skilled word recognition in children and adults. However, little is known about how ensembles of words encountered during early learning affect learning outcomes over timescales larger than what can be accomplished in a controlled experimental setting. In order to move past this limitation, using an established connectionist learning architecture (Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, &amp; Patterson, 1996; Seidenberg &amp; McClelland, 1989) we examined how variation in word ensembles influence learning and generalization during early reading acquisition. We simulated learners (N = 30,000) exposed to different sets of monosyllabic printed words drawn randomly from children’s literature at a large scale. In order to examine how different ensembles might impact learning depending on the learner's ability to represent the relationship between letters and sounds, we also manipulated the representational capacity of models by systematically changing the number of hidden units, holding the ensemble of words constant. Across levels of representational capacity each model had \"twins\" which differed only in terms of the number of hidden units they possessed. Results demonstrate significant variation in learning outcomes in a set of generalization words as a function of the word, ensemble and representational capacity. These findings inform educational practices by highlighting the importance of deliberate word selection to support early development.",

Using data from the Africa Long Life Study, which sampled young adults from Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa (N = 2,770), we tested how personality traits are linked to seven important life outcomes. The Big Two personality traits, agency and communion, were assessed 2 to 3 years prior to the assessment of outcomes, including self-reported health, employment status, and anxiety. We used specification-curve analysis to examine the robustness of personality-outcome associations. Higher levels of agency and communion robustly predicted higher levels of self-rated health, and lower levels of anxiety and depression over 2 to 3 years. Furthermore, higher levels of communion predicted being employed 2 to 3 years later. However, personality-outcome associations were smaller than expected based on findings from Western countries (.02 ≤ |r| ≤ .11). Our findings provide novel insights into the cross-cultural replicability of personality-outcome associations, and we discuss the implications of our findings for personality research.",

Grounded in critical race theory, functionalism, and social capital theory, the research examined the lived experiences of eight Ghanaian women between the ages of 18 and 21. Using interpretative phenomenological analysis, data were collected through 90-minute semi-structured Zoom interviews. Findings revealed that colorism is embedded within structural and social systems, shaping job access through appearance-based biases and unequal reliance on social capital. Lighter-skinned participants reported more direct hiring pathways, while darker-skinned participants faced exclusion, subtle discrimination, and greater dependency on referrals and mentorship. The study also uncovered varied levels of awareness regarding colorism’s influence, ranging from denial to gradual recognition. These insights culminated in the development of a researcher-constructed conceptual model illustrating how institutional norms, network-based gatekeeping, and internalized perceptions of professionalism converge to reinforce colorism in employment. The study highlights the need for inclusive hiring practices and broader systemic reforms to address appearance-based inequities in the Ghanaian job market.",

Participants (N = 41) were classified into four groups based on the degree of smoking (≤ 14 or ≥ 15 cigarettes per day) and the median total score on resilience scales (low-resilience low-smoking, low-resilience high-smoking, high-resilience low-smoking, and high-resilience high-smoking). Participants completed the TSST-OL, measuring subjective stress and salivary cortisol, at eight time points. A two-piece multilevel growth curve model with landmark registration (GCM-LR) examined the effects of smoking habits and resilience scores on cortisol concentrations. Blunted cortisol responses were similarly present in all four groups; thus, my hypothesis was unsupported. All groups showed similarly elevated subjective stress responses. GCM-LR results showed no significant cortisol increase, but the fixed effect of cortisol recovery was significant. The likelihood ratio test showed that the random effect of resilience scores was significant. Habitual smokers do not have an elevated cortisol response, even in stressful situations. Substantial individual differences were suggested in the effect of resilience scale scores on cortisol concentration.",

Humans, like all life, are sensitive to their environment.  Mentally ill or unstable individuals can be triggered into impulsive and violent activities from spikes in serum serotonin.  Human serum histamine level is directly proportional to environmental allergen or pollen levels, but serum serotonin level is inversely proportional to serum histamine levels with human males having 52% more serotonin than females.  Data show an association between the dates of violent acts, especially male single shooter mass shootings in the United States, and the dates of dramatic decreases in pollen levels thus indicating pollen and serum histamine level drops as a possible precursor or triggering relationship.  This knowledge can be used as a potential predictor for law enforcement and medical agencies for a given city or region.  Mental health professionals would be advised to lower serotonin boosting meds and even supplement antihistamine and sedative medications to male patients in the timeframes of March through June, for spring tree pollens especially juniper tree pollen, and from September through November, for fall ragweed weed pollen.",

          "authors": "Vaishnavi B Mohan; Ezgi Irmak Yucel; Ione Fine; Geoffrey M. Boynton",
          "abstract": "Introduction: Optogenetics is a promising technology to restore vision in individuals with blindness due to retinal disorders. Light-sensitive proteins (opsins) are introduced intravitreally and bind to surviving non-photosensitive retinal cells to elicit a neural response to visual stimuli. Much of this research is done with mouse models, where it is not obvious how a given opsin would translate to human visual perception. Our goal was to provide estimates of potential patients’ spatio-temporal contrast sensitivity and perceptual experiences. We created ‘virtual patients’ consisting of neurotypical subjects viewing stimuli modified to match the temporal properties of two state-of-the-art opsins 4xBGAG12,460:SNAP-mGluR2 and ChRmine. Methods: A non-linear model based on single cell electrophysiological data describing the sensitivity and temporal dynamics of each opsin was used to spatiotemporally modulate a counterphase modulated Gabor stimulus to replicate the predicted retinal stimulus of optogenetic patients. Contrast detection thresholds for optogenetic and control stimuli were obtained using a 2AFC quick CSF Bayesian adaptive procedure across a range of spatial and temporal frequencies. Results: Contrast sensitivity for 4xBGAG12,460:SNAP-mGluR2 declined rapidly with increasing temporal frequency compared to the control stimulus, consistent with this opsin’s slow temporal dynamics. Sensitivity to opsin ChRmine was lower overall, but there was little decline in sensitivity at higher temporal frequencies. Conclusion: Using this virtual patient paradigm, we demonstrate the trade-off between sensitivity and temporal resolution for two example opsins. 4xBGAG12,460:SNAP-mGluR2 would be expected to outperform ChRmine under many laboratory tests, such as a Snellen eye chart for a patient capable of maintaining stable fixation. However ChRmine would be predicted to outperform 4xBGAG12,460:SNAP-mGluR2 during outdoor navigation in daylight. Ultimately, our goal is to predict patients’ performance across a wide range of clinically relevant tasks directly from an opsin’s temporal dynamics, paving the way for informed optimization of sight-restoration therapies before clinical application.",

The model posits that in managing intercultural relations, individuals are driven by the needs for growth and development as well as the needs for security and safety. Whereas the promotion focus needs for growth and development can be met by building intercultural relationships, the prevention focus needs for security and safety can be met by preventing relationship damage. The promotion-prevention motivational systems are associated with unique affective reactions in response to anticipated outcomes. Such affect-driven outcome expectancies shape the learning processes. The ALPs model presents a comprehensive cultural competence framework and identifies specific cultural competence strategies that have been overlooked in the existing literature. Finally, the contributions of the ALPs model to theoretical advancement are evaluated.",

          "abstract": "Around 60% of young people worldwide experience at least one form of childhood adversity, such as abuse, neglect, bullying, or poverty. These stressful experiences can have long-lasting effects and significantly increase the risk of mental health problems. To aid future intervention and prevention efforts, my doctoral research examined how childhood adversity contributes to mental health difficulties, and whether and how friendships can help protect against these effects.\n\nUsing a combination of literature reviews, behavioral studies, and brain imaging research, my colleagues and I found that young people with more severe childhood adversity were at greater risk of social isolation, being harmed or harming others, and developing mental health problems. This was partly due to differences in how they process and perceive stress. In addition, we found that those with strong, high-quality friendships reported lower stress perceptions and fewer mental health difficulties.\n\nThese findings matter for two key reasons. First, they detail how childhood adversity increases vulnerability to mental health problems. Second, they demonstrate that high-quality friendships play a critical protective role in mental health – and help explain how, by reducing stress perceptions. Hence, helping young people build and maintain supportive friendships could be an important way to promote mental health, especially for those who have faced childhood adversity.",

This paper introduces the FOCUS method—Find, Organize, Condense, Understand, and Synthesize—a framework for integrating AI into research workflows while preserving intellectual rigor. The approach uses AI-powered search to cast wider nets across formal and informal knowledge sources, converts ephemeral audio content into searchable text, employs structured prompts to extract insights from dense papers, leverages dialogue for deeper comprehension, and maintains human synthesis of disparate findings. Privacy concerns can be addressed through local models or platforms that don't train on user data. When implemented thoughtfully, these tools enable researchers to read more widely and think more deeply without sacrificing the critical thinking that defines good science. As research volume continues growing beyond individual capacity, the FOCUS method offers a path to expand intellectual reach while maintaining scholarly depth.",

          "abstract": "Images vary in how likely they are to be remembered, a characteristic referred to as memorability. While previous work has identified perceptual and semantic features that predict image memorability, less is known about how those features engage the cognitive systems that support memory. One open question is whether attention plays a role. Although some findings suggest that memorability operates independently of attention, these experiments have only tested a limited set of attentional mechanisms. The present research examines whether temporal attention contributes to image memorability using the attentional blink (AB), a phenomenon in which detection of a second target (T2) is impaired when it appears shortly after the first (T1). Two experiments used a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task with streams of images containing two intact targets among scrambled distractors. In Experiment 1, T1 memorability was manipulated, while in Experiment 2, T2 memorability was manipulated. In both experiments, the temporal gap between targets was also manipulated to assess how target memorability influences AB dynamics. Results showed that highly memorable T1s exacerbated the AB, suggesting they engage attention for longer. In contrast, highly memorable T2s attenuated the AB, indicating that they may more effectively trigger the attentional processes required for encoding. These findings suggest that memorability does not operate independently of attention but instead reflects how effectively an image engages the cognitive processes needed for encoding.",

          "abstract": "Persistence and perseverance, even in the face of great adversity, are admirable qualities. However, knowing when to stop pursuing something is as important as exerting effort toward attaining a goal. How do people decide when to persist and when to quit? Here, we design a novel task to study this question, in which people were given a finite number of opportunities to pursue stochastic rewards by selecting among a set of options that provide a reward each trial. At any time, if people were not satisfied with the option they had selected they could choose to abandon it and instead try a new option. However, if they did so they could never return to the previous option. Mathematical analysis of this task shows that the optimal strategy explores a relatively small number of options before settling on a sufficiently good option. Further, we find that the optimal strategy is to abandon an option if the total number of remaining trials exceeds a threshold specified by the observed option’s performance. A large-scale, pre-registered experiment (N = 3, 632) reveals that people largely behave in accordance with the optimal strategy. People also make decisions to persist with an option based on its performance and they typically explore relatively few options before settling on a sufficiently good one. However, compared to the optimal strategy, people are less sensitive to the number of remaining trials and are more likely to persist with sub-optimal options.",

We demonstrate an alternative approach that samples deeply and broadly to discover reliable person-specific, multimodal patterns of daily life experience. Ninety-seven healthy adults wore cardiac monitors for 8 hours/day for 14 days and reported current valence, arousal, primary activity, social context, and emotions (via free report) when prompted following a substantial cardiac interbeat interval change (and twice randomly each day). From each event (10,755 total, M=110.9 events/person), we extracted cardiovascular, postural, affective, and contextual features. Integrative clustering of these features identified 313 multimodal patterns (M=3.2 patterns/person), which were largely person-specific, with 81.7% of patterns being unique to one person. The pattern-distinguishing features also varied by person. Finally, self-generated emotion labels had many-to-many mappings with multimodal patterns. Our approach has broad utility and provides further evidence that emotions are diverse populations of instances.",

          "abstract": "In the digital era, human cooperation is increasingly mediated by indirect social cues such as ratings, reviews, and other digital traces left in online environments. These traces often guide collective behavior via stigmergy, a coordination mechanism whereby individuals interact through modifications of a shared environment. In this study, we explore how simple model-driven bots can influence human cooperation or defection in a competitive rating game inspired by online marketplaces. Participants, unaware of the bots' presence, interacted with either four human partners or four bots exhibiting predefined behaviors—cooperative, neutral, deceptive, or optimized for group performance. We show that the presence and behavior of bots significantly affect human strategies and performance. Higher levels of cooperation among bots improve human outcomes but also increase the frequency of deceptive human strategies, suggesting exploitation of reliable social information. Conversely, in less cooperative environments, participants adopt more collaborative or neutral behaviors to preserve informational value. By classifying individuals into three behavioral profiles—collaborators, neutrals, and defectors—we develop a linear regression model using three cues: the average value of rated cells, the diversity of rated cells, and the player's rank. These cues allow accurate prediction of behavioral profile distributions across experimental conditions. An adaptive agent-based model further reproduces the empirical results. Our findings demonstrate that even simple bots can strongly influence collective dynamics in human groups. These insights have implications for the design of recommendation systems, the regulation of automated agents, and the understanding of cooperation and deception in digital societies.",

We conducted a 6-week, digital intervention with multiple treatment groups and a randomized control design (N = 426) to examine the efficacy of theory-based strategies that varied in scope, intensity, and content. Across groups, participants decreased on self-report and implicit neuroticism measures (d = -0.18 to -0.38). Intervention effects exceeded normative change and demand effects, were specific to neuroticism, and persisted at 2-month follow-up (d = -0.14 to -0.43). Efficacy was proportional to treatment intensity and specificity (d = -0.16 to -0.60), and there was some evidence that state-based strategies have stronger immediate effects whereas habit-based strategies have more enduring effects. This study demonstrates that motivated people can become meaningfully less neurotic with effort in just 6 weeks and offers insights into underlying mechanisms.",

Across nine simulation studies, we varied the task complexity and prompt design to examine conditions under which previously reported model-based RL signatures could be replicated. We found that GPT-3.5 showed model-based RL signatures in simplified task settings, but that these effects disappeared under de-simplified task versions. Crucially, model-based reasoning signatures could be re-established when incorporating an inner speech-analog prompt, requiring the LLM agent to reflect on previous trials and anticipate consequences of future actions. Our fine-grained analyses of behavioral learning dynamics highlight the role of structured reflective and anticipatory linguistic processes in enabling complex response patterns in LLMs and reveal both similarities and differences to human decision-making patterns.",

          "title": "Can family cohesion and parent-child relationship quality buffer the effects of parental adverse childhood experiences on adolescent epigenetic age acceleration?",
          "authors": "Jenny Zhen-Duan; Alexandre Lussier; Anna E. Wilson; Sarah M. Merrill; Kristin Valentino; Erin C. Dunn; Alejandra D. Chavez",
          "abstract": "Introduction: Parental adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), or adversities parents experience when they are children, significantly impact their children's biobehavioral outcomes. Maternal ACEs are associated with epigenetic age acceleration (EAA; faster biological aging) in infants (Sosnowski et al., 2024) and young children (Nwanaji-Enwerem et al., 2021). While the effects of paternal ACEs and EAA have not been directly examined, emerging studies indicate that paternal ACEs correlate with DNA methylation in their infants, and these methylated CpG (genetic) were associated with externalizing outcomes three years later (Merrill et al., 2021). Family factors (e.g., positive parenting practices) can buffer the association between maternal ACEs and EAA (Sullivan et al., 2023). However, it is unclear if family factors buffer the effects of both maternal and paternal ACEs and EAA; and whether the associations between parental ACEs and EAA are observed later in development, like adolescence.  \n\n \n\nHypotheses: To examine whether parental ACEs and youth’s EAA are moderated by family factors (i.e., family cohesion, parent-child relationship quality). We hypothesized that both fathers’ and mothers’ family-level (e.g., maltreatment, family dysfunction) and community-level (e.g., discrimination, community violence) ACEs would be associated with EAA, but that family factors would mitigate this effect.  \n\n \n\nSample: Participants were from the ENLACEs study. Participating families had to be of Mexican descent, and youth had to be between the ages of 12 and 15 at baseline. Our study included family triads recruited from northern Indiana: youth (n = 120), mothers (n = 120), and fathers (n = 120).  \n\n \n\nStudy Methods: Participants were recruited with the help of community-based partners. Bilingual and bicultural assistants administered surveys to parents in English or Spanish, while youth surveys were self-administered on tablets. Surveys assessing parental ACEs were collected during Wave 1, youth-reported questionnaires of parent-child relationships and family cohesion were collected in Wave 2, and salivary DNA for epigenetic analysis was collected in Wave 2. Epigenetic age acceleration was estimated from two clocks: the Pediatric Buccal Epigenetic (PedBE) and Horvarth. We employed path analysis and maximum likelihood estimations with robust standard errors in R.  \n\n \n\nResults  \n\nConsistent with our hypothesis, the association between fathers' family-level ACEs and youth EAA was moderated by parent-child relationship in both clocks: PedBE (beta=-0.03; p=0.086) and Horvath (beta=-0.173; p=0.004). Similarly, the association between mothers’ community-level ACEs and EAA was moderated by family cohesion: PedBE (beta=-0.009; p=0.041) and Horvath (beta=-0.045; p=0.001). In contrast to hypothesized directions, family cohesion moderated the association between fathers and mothers’ family-level ACEs and EAA: PedBE (beta=0.021; p=0.008) and Horvath (beta=0.018; p=0.036), respectively.   \n\n \n\nConclusion \n\nConsistent with previous mother-child dyadic studies, fathers’ ACEs can similarly impact their children’s EAA, and these observations can also be noted during adolescence. While seemingly counterintuitive, this finding points to family cohesion as an element by which family factors can strongly affect their children's biology, whether positively or negatively. Future research will be necessary to elucidate the nuanced impact of family factors on the potential intergenerational biological consequences of parental ACEs, but these findings lay a foundation for future family-based interventions.",

Though alignment of one’s values in one’s work facilitates a persistence in motivation, it is not well understood if STEM faculty researchers are aware of the communal values their student researchers often hold. Here we focus on a key engine of the university research enterprise – graduate students – and ask if faculty mentors are cognizant of and make explicit their attunement to the communal values of their graduate student researchers. We found that when describing the values of graduate students, faculty underestimate the communal values that members of RMM groups are more likely to hold. When faculty communicated communal values, this correlated positively with a more diverse research lab and several measures of faculty success.",

          "authors": "Alexandre Heeren; Camille Mouguiama-Daouda",
          "abstract": "Climate change represents an unprecedented threat, with rising levels of climate anxiety widely reported. Most psychological research has primarily examined relationships between climate anxiety and mitigation behaviors while largely neglecting adaptation behaviors, which involve preparing for inevitable climate impacts. Yet, ethological and foundational anxiety theories emphasize anxiety's adaptive role in fostering preparedness and proactive coping with threats, particularly in uncertain, future-oriented situations. Based on this framework, we examined whether intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and future anticipation influence the association between climate anxiety and adaptation versus mitigation behaviors. In a preregistered fashion, we analyzed data from 968 French-speaking adults using two complementary computational network modeling approaches: (1) a graphical Gaussian model to examine conditional associations among climate anxiety, IU components (prospective and inhibitory), future anticipation, experience of climate change, and adaptation and mitigation behaviors; and (2) a directed acyclic graph to generate a data-driven model of the directional probabilistic dependencies among these variables. Results consistently highlighted prospective IU—characterized by proactive information-seeking and planning in the face of uncertainty—as central within the network, and positively linked to adaptation behaviors and climate anxiety. Conversely, inhibitory IU (characterized by paralysis in uncertainty) appeared to be peripheral. This study, which relies on new computational methods, emphasizes the essential yet overlooked role of adaptation and offers fresh, data-driven insights into its relationship with climate anxiety, future anticipations, and intolerance of uncertainty.",

          "authors": "Arie Todd Greenleaf",
          "abstract": "Modern science, from physics to biology, rests on a foundational assumption: entities are primary, and the relations between them are secondary. This paper argues that this substance-first ontology is the principal barrier to a scientific theory of consciousness and proposes its inversion: relations are fundamental.\nFrom this new paradigm, termed Dynergeia, a specific, falsifiable theory of consciousness naturally emerges. It posits that experience is instantiated whenever five universal relational patterns (self-reference, division-creation, information integration, responsiveness, and flux) achieve dynamic coherence within a system’s native temporal window (τ). This state is quantified by a substrate-agnostic metric, Pattern-Temporal Synergy (PTS), which makes high-risk predictions, including a precise collapse under anesthesia and a strong correlation with cross-species behavioral flexibility.\nThis relational framework does not merely offer a new solution; it dissolves the old problems. The \"hard problem\" is revealed as a category error. Time is reframed as an emergent architecture constructed by coordinated events. The result is a proposed unification of the physical and phenomenological worlds, grounded not in a shared substance, but in a shared universal grammar. This work presents a direct, empirical test of a new foundation for science itself.",

However, the causal impact of ruminative\nstates on cognitive performance and subjective difficulties remains untested.\n\nMethods:\nIn a preregistered online study, 282 participants were randomly assigned to a rumination\nor neutral group. Both groups recalled an upsetting event, followed by a rumination\ninduction or neutral condition for either group.

We conducted two pre-registered studies (N=408 and N=906) examining how Americans perceive support for political violence within their own and opposing political parties. In Study 1, Democrats estimated that 29.60% of Republicans report supporting political violence, but only 1.83% of Republicans actually report support, representing a 1,517% overestimation. In contrast, Republicans estimated that 19.48% of Democrats report supporting political violence, but only 3.54 % of Democrats actually did—a 450% overestimation. Thus, while both groups overestimated the prevalence of outparty members’ political violence support, we find that Democrats are significantly more pessimistic. In Study 2, we replicated this finding with a larger, nationally representative sample. We also explored the limits of this asymmetry and found no evidence of asymmetric perceptions for non-political crime support or ingroup members’ political violence support, suggesting a unique asymmetry in perceived outgroup political violence support.",

          "abstract": "Objective: We explored transfer of learning from brief practice with different input devices in the Navy’s Performance Based Measures Battery (PBM), a psychomotor subset of the Aviation Selection Test Battery (ASTB).\n\nBackground: The PBM is a set of computerized tests used as a part of the ASTB to select aviators in the U.S. military. Official practice is not available, leading candidates to practice with unofficial re-creations and with or without access to the stick-and-throttle used on the PBM. \n\nMethod: Our between-subjects study with 152 cadets from the U.S. Military Academy evaluated the impact of mouse/keyboard or stick/throttle practice on the psychomotor portions of the PBM compared to a control group that was only presented with an informational video.\n\nResults: The results showed that practice with either input device resulted in improved performance relative to control on the PBM’s two-dimensional airplane tracking task (ATT). For the simpler vertical tracking task (VTT), the mouse/keyboard group showed significantly worse performance than either stick/throttle practice or control groups, indicating a transfer cost from practicing with an alternative input device.\n\nConclusion: The results suggest that becoming familiar with the unique dynamics of the ATT may be more important than practicing with the appropriate input device. Conversely, device-specific motor learning appears to be a more impactful determinant of performance for the simpler VTT. This shows that transfer effects from alternative input devices depends in part on properties of the task.\n\nApplication: This research can inform practice policies for psychomotor test selection.",

          "authors": "Emily Liquin",
          "abstract": "Why do people feel curious about some questions but not others? Recent accounts of curiosity argue that curiosity should be highest when learning is likely to occur and likely to be rapid. This implies that variation in “information accessibility”—the ease and speed with which information can be acquired—might affect curiosity. Specifically, learning is less likely to occur and less likely to be rapid when information is less accessible, which might decrease curiosity. We tested this prediction in three preregistered experiments with a total of 419 participants. In Experiments 1 and 2, we prompted adult participants to rate their curiosity about the answers to trivia questions. For each question, they were informed that information accessibility would be high—they would receive the answer with minimal time and effort—or low—they would receive the answer with substantial time and effort. In Experiment 3, we additionally varied the probability that information search would be successful. Across studies, we found that information accessibility affected decisions to seek information, but not self-reported curiosity. This suggests that curiosity is unhindered by the practical costs of information search—and perhaps, sensitive to “idealized” expectations about the learning process, rather than “practical” expectations that incorporate current barriers to learning.",

          "abstract": "When we perceive, there is something we perceive. When we think, there is something we think\nof. When we dream, something is dreamt. These seem all platitudes: obvious and unproblematic\ntruths. And, given that the things perceived, thought of, or dreamed are what philosophers call the\nmental contents of our states, few things should seem as obvious and unproblematic as the\nexistence of mental contents. And yet, I shall here argue that, when closely examined, mental\ncontents appear to be illusions. Just like the proverbial sawn-in-half assistant on the magician\nstage, they merely appear to exist, without actually existing. To substantiate this view I will first fix\nthe reference of “mental content” and “illusion” in an innocent, theory neutral manner - that is, by\nrelying on paradigmatic positive and negative examples of them (sections 2 and 3). I will also show\nthat such paradigmatic examples allow us to extract a list of features that such examples allow us\nto identify features that paradigmatically identify contents and illusions as such, enabling us to\nrecognize them. With these features at hand, I will thus argue that mental contents bear all the\nfeatures that paradigmatically identify illusions. Otherwise put, I will argue that mental contents\nare anomalous, causally insulated, systematic, persistent and bound to a single mode of access in\nthe same way paradigmatic examples of illusions are (Section 4). Having argued for my main claim,\nI will defend it from a couple of intuitive objections; namely that it is to silly to be taken seriously,\ngiven that mental content is given in a way that does not permit to seriously doubt of its existence\n(section 5), and that my claim is incoherent (section 6). I’ll show that, intuitive as they are, the\nobjections are not compelling, and indeed they can be easily answered. Lastly, I will conclude the\npaper sketching the possible developments of an illusionistic view of content (section 7).",

          "abstract": "Background: While psychopathology research increasingly favors dimensions over categorical diagnostics, nosology, and treatment, much about the dimensions’ assessment is still unknown, particularly for children and adolescents. With most research based single-source, cross-sectional data, findings are contaminated by random error and systematic biases that make up much of scale scores’ variance and make their correlations uninterpretable. We describe a scale score variance decomposition model that leverages multi-informant data to estimate scale scores’ – and even individual items’ – true correlations among themselves and with other variables.\n\nMethods: After presenting the model, we reviewed relevant literature in personality and psychopathology domains. Also, since the model treats cross-rater correlations as the degrees of valid scale score variance, we reviewed literature on cross-rater agreement for normal and maladaptive psychological traits in children and adults.\n\nResults: True correlations based on multi-informant data are consistently stronger than correlations based on single-source data, validating our model and showing its benefits. Cross-rater agreement tended to have similar magnitudes for both adaptative and maladaptive traits, suggesting similar degrees of valid variance, systematic method biases, and error and validating our models’ use for psychopathology ratings. However, agreement tends to be somewhat lower in children than adults, implying that multi-informant child research requires larger samples for similar precision when estimating true correlations. \n\nDiscussion and Conclusions: We discuss how multi-informant data and our model can be especially useful for understanding child psychopathology, and conclude by offering suggestions of how to leverage the model to explore dimensional models of psychopathology.",

Across four studies, we: (a) introduce one of the most\ncomprehensive trait lists to-date (2,847 trait words); (b) establish normative human ratings of\nthese traits (from N = 3,070 English speakers) along 24 empirically-derived dimensions; (c)\ndetect a four-factor structure of Fitness, Agency, Communion, and Traditionalism (FACT) from\nthese dimensions; and (d) reveal systematic differences in the coherence, valence, and historical\nevolution of these dimensions and factors.

          "abstract": "There is a growing realization that experimental tasks that produce reliable effects in group comparisons can simultaneously provide unreliable assessments of individual differences. Proposed solutions to this “reliability paradox” range from collecting more test trials to modifying the tasks and/or the way in which effects are measured from these tasks. Here we systematically compare two proposed modeling solutions in a cognitive conflict task. Using the ratio of individual variability of the conflict effect (i.e., signal) and the trial-by-trial variation in the data (i.e., noise) obtained from Bayesian hierarchical modeling, we examine whether improving statistical modeling may improve the reliability of individual differences assessment in four Stroop datasets. The proposed improvements are 1) increasing the descriptive adequacy of the statistical models from which conflict effects are derived, and 2) using psychologically-motivated measures from cognitive measurement models. Our results show that the type of model does not have a consistent effect on the signal-to-noise ratio: the proposed solutions improved reliability in only one of the four datasets. We provide analytical and simulation-based approaches to compute the signal-to-noise ratio for a range of models of varying sophistication and discuss their potential to aid in developing and comparing new measurement solutions to the reliability paradox.",

          "abstract": "Many of today’s pressing societal challenges, such as organ shortages, low vaccination rates, and climate change, require significant changes in individual behavior. One promising intervention to encourage such behavioral change is the opt-out default, which presumes consent for a desirable action rather than requiring active opt in. While past research focused on the impact of opt-out defaults on the targeted behavior, potential crowding out of related behaviors has been largely overlooked. Here, we investigate whether adopting opt-out policies for deceased organ donation reduces living donations, a related prosocial behavior serving the same public good. Analyzing epidemiological panel data from countries that adopted an opt-out default between 2000 and 2023, we find that the policy switch, on average, leads to a non-significant increase in annual deceased donor rates of +1.21 people per million population (+7%, P = .213) but to a significant decrease in living donor rates of -4.59 people per million population (–29%, P = .026). Across four additional studies, we demonstrate that this crowding out effect is reflected in a reduced willingness for living altruistic (vs. familial) donations and is attributable to a stronger belief that the organ supply is sufficiently met with deceased donations under opt-out (vs. opt-in). Our research advances insights into the unintended consequences of default nudges and suggests ways to mitigate them.",

The results confirmed, for the first time with longitudinal evidence, the pattern of indirect associations between the Dark Triad and anxiety through resilience/mental toughness. The findings also emphasized the importance of differentiating the three ‘dark traits’, as they showed different relations with other traits in the network. For example, narcissism was unique among the Dark Triad in that it predicted better mental health, whereas Machiavellianism and psychopathy were linked to poorer resilience and mental health.  Narcissism was also the most influential node in the network of personality, resilience and anxiety. Considering the consistency of the effects across the samples, the results provide a promising avenue for research into malleability of personality networks and for developing educational and workplace interventions.",

          "authors": "Leonardi Salvatore",
          "abstract": "This article introduces an innovative theory of mind that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries (cognition, emotion, action), offering a perspective centered on the experience of the acting/perceiving subject. Moving beyond purely mechanistic descriptions, the model presents three primary functional spheres—the \"I Act,\" the \"I Socialize,\" and the \"I Think\"—whose fundamental operational mode is anticipation/verification within their respective domains. This mode is realized through the constant dynamic interplay between top-down flows (internally generated anticipations) and bottom-up flows (incoming sensory data). \n\nUnderpinning these functional spheres are two fundamental and omnipresent Cardinal Principles, universal to all organisms with a nervous system: the Holistic Self (HS) and the Quantum Self (QS). These two core principles perform dual perceptive and executive functions, supporting the anticipation/verification mode of the three \"I\"s. The HS is responsible for the awareness of state and wholeness, the synthesis of forms and identities, while the QS manages the differentiation of figures and the awareness of interactions and relationships. \n\nA unifying and central principle orchestrating the mind's dynamism and facilitating fluid transitions between these functional spheres is the Prognostic Mind (Prognostica Mens). Its role is the universal application of the operational method of constantly generating and integrating predictions, followed by their verification. But how these predictions and knowledge itself take shape is guided by a fundamental process called Cognitive Morphogenesis. This process describes how knowledge is generated and organized at all levels, from the simplest to the most complex, operating through the dynamic interaction of the HS and QS. \n\nIn this continuous cycle, perception and execution are not mere functions, but intrinsic and dynamic goals of the anticipation/verification method: perception verifies a sensory/cognitive anticipation (\"the then\" of \"if...then\"), and execution performs an action to verify a motor/intentional anticipation. The article outlines these principles and their evolution through the functional spheres, illustrating how the Prognostic Mind articulates into the \"I Act\" (present in all animals), the \"I Socialize\" (typical of birds and mammals), and the \"I Think\" (unique to humans). It also touches upon the related systems of mnemonic encoding and representation (holistic and quantum encoding). The integrated and dynamic nature of the mind is emphasized, laying the groundwork for future, more in-depth discussions of each functional sphere and their underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, such as the crucial role of gamma motoneurons (γ-MNs) and muscle spindles in embodied attention and perceptual anticipation, as well as their manifestation in higher-level cognitive processes like language, specifically explored through Event-Related Potentials (ERPs). \n\nThe article further discusses the model's validity at a high level of generalization, highlighting its coherence and the possibility of descending to more detailed levels of analysis for a deeper understanding of mental and neural phenomena, including the articulation of the HS and QS across different interoceptive and exteroceptive sensory modalities.",

In response, this article introduces Computational Thinking (CT) as a novel, non-pharmacological framework to support cognitive organization in older adults experiencing cognitive frailty. Though CT has gained traction in fields like PK-16 education, including special education, for enhancing executive function and problem-solving, it has not yet been applied to geriatric- or memory-care contexts. This perspective proposes that CT’s core components (i.e., decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking) may align with residual cognitive strengths in mild-to-moderate dementia, offering a strengths-based, meta-cognitive scaffold for processing routines, instructions, and transitions. We provide theoretical rationale, interdisciplinary support, and concrete implementation examples to illustrate how CT can augment existing care models. By emphasizing cognitive structuring over costly service expansion, CT has the potential to complement current interventions and inform more efficient, person-centered dementia care strategies.",

Using Bayesian statistics, we found cumulative evidence that when support givers used higher pitch in delivering these reappraisals, targets of support experienced less negative affect. Targets of support also reported greater relationship satisfaction with support givers who used higher pitch during reappraisal.

          "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders represent a significant public health concern due to their high prevalence and substantial impact across the lifespan. Despite advances in understanding their neurobiological underpinnings, the transdiagnostic mechanisms driving psychiatric conditions remain unclear. Neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI) is an emerging, non-invasive technique for investigating the dopaminergic (DA) and norepinephric (NE) systems, offering valuable insights into their role in psychiatric disorders. This review explores the potential of NM-MRI in psychiatric research, emphasizing its ability to reveal links between DA and NE dysregulation and psychiatric conditions, therewith offering insights in neurobiological mechanisms. We summarize current NM-MRI findings across psychiatric disorders, including psychosis, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders. Overall, NM-MRI has shown considerable potential in studying psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, addiction, and depression. However, its application remains limited in disorders like anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, and neurodevelopmental disorders, despite their known associations with DA and NE dysfunction. To fully establish NM-MRI as a clinical research tool, further efforts are needed to standardize protocols and improve the technique’s specificity and reliability in psychiatric contexts. Moreover, longitudinal studies and cross-diagnostic comparisons are essential to establish NM-MRI as a potential marker for treatment response and identifying individuals at risk of developing psychiatric disorders. Current review underscores the promise of NM-MRI's for early diagnosis, intervention, and advancing mental health research.",

          "abstract": "Analogies are a fundamental part of our cognition and communication. Humans are also a social species with shared cultural repertoires learnt throughout our lifetimes. As such, we expect analogies to enable the learning of complex, novel information by communication that takes advantage of shared cultural information. Here, we demonstrate the plausibility of this proposal and clarify its scope through computational modelling. We first model the individual-level process of learning via analogy with access to a shared repertoire of cultural information, using NK landscapes to represent high-dimensional solution spaces for complex problems. We then analyse a model of population dynamics to consider the conditions under which analogical communication will evolve and be maintained when costly. Our analyses suggest that even when analogy use is costly in terms of both search time and memory constraints, it can nevertheless be advantageous by allowing learners to obtain high-quality solutions more efficiently and more often than those who don't learn via analogy.",

          "abstract": "Social relationships are central to well-being because they fulfill basic affiliation needs. To describe how these needs are regulated, theories connect daily-life processes of social contact, social desire, and affect. Still, such processes remain empirically underexplored because of their complexity. In this study, we estimated multivariate associations of social desire and affect with social contact across different modalities (in-person, digital), time scales (hourly, daily), and levels of analysis (between-person, contemporaneous, temporally lagged). Participants from two age-heterogeneous samples answered experience sampling questions and contributed data through unobtrusive smartphone sensing, with roughly hourly assessments across 2 days (N = 303) and daily assessments across 14 days (N = 377). Multi-level vector autoregressive network models revealed associations between social contact, social desire, and affect across levels of analysis. Results were highly specific to the examined time scale. When measured at an hourly timescale, people desired more social contact than usual when they engaged in more in-person contact, and higher social desire predicted more future social contact in both experience sampling and smartphone sensing. In contrast, at a daily timescale, social desire did not predict future contact. Bidirectional linkages of affect and social contact were also much denser hourly (vs. daily). Compared to in-person contact, calls and communication app usage generally showed distinct associations with affect. We discuss theoretical implications for the dynamic regulation of social needs, especially regarding temporal processes and the role of positive affect in predicting social contact. Finally, we delineate future directions of multi-method research into daily-life social dynamics.",

Clinical outcomes were derived from changes in repeated self-reported scores on the standardized Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 (GAD-7) surveys administered before the first and most recent treatment visits. Adjusted logistic and linear regression was used for the analyses examining type of provider characteristic selected, engagement, and changes in each clinical outcome.\nResults  This study included Grow Therapy patients (mean age 34.0 years; 69.8% identifying as female). Over a quarter of patients selected a provider specialty (27.1%) and 4.4% selected a provider identity. Patients met with their provider a mean of 9.6 times (67.4% had 3 or more visits) and, among complete case patients with at least 2 PHQ-9 and 2 GAD-7 assessments (n=67,105), a large proportion showed significantly improved symptoms of depression (PHQ-9 improvement=3.5, 60.0% with a minimal clinically important difference [MCID]) and anxiety (GAD-7 improvement=3.5, 66.1% MCID). Patients selecting a provider specialty had fewer visits but had greater declines in depression symptoms, and those selecting a provider identity engaged longer in care than patients not selecting each of these characteristics, respectively.\nConclusions and Relevance  This real world study demonstrates that a technology-enabled mental health platform that allows patients to self-select their provider is engaging and preliminarily efficacious. Patients may maximize benefits of these platforms by selecting preferred characteristics of their providers.",

          "abstract": "Politics can have substantial and wide adverse effects on people’s physical and mental health, especially in politically polarized environments. As a result, political polarization is now recognized as a major non-medical cause of disease and suffering. We examine if and how citizens can protect their health from such adverse effects without undermining their civic engagement.  We identify a psychological mechanism of resilience rooted in bodily awareness and show that interoception –the ability to perceive and trust one’s internal bodily signals– can act as a protective factor against the adverse health effects of politics. Across three studies on over 2,000 participants conducted during the 2022 mid-term U.S. election and the 2024 U.S. presidential election, higher interoceptive sensibility was consistently associated with lower reported costs of politics on emotional, physical, behavioral, and social health, while controlling for political identity, demographics, and emotion regulation strategies. During the emotionally charged 2024 election, individuals high in interoceptive sensibility reported fewer negative emotions, greater hope for the future and less fear, particularly if their candidate lost. These benefits extended to greater emotional resilience and a more positive outlook about the nation’s future. Importantly, interoceptive sensibility was positively associated with political engagement and efficacy, suggesting that better interoception awareness enhances, rather than inhibits, democratic participation. Our findings highlight interoceptive sensibility as a promising trait for mitigating politi-cal stress without reducing civic involvement.",

          "abstract": "In language processing, word meanings are retrieved from memory and converted into sentential expressions that have referential meaning at the level of utterances. Cognitive processes related to lexical retrieval versus the construction of referential meaning through grammar have not been properly disentangled yet. We addressed this with an experimental design aimed to link well-known N400 effects and late positive components (LPCs) to this distinction. We tested the hypothesis that semantic conflicts derived from a collision with stored (= ‘offline’) knowledge would elicit N400 effects, while semantic conflicts arising ‘online’ during the grammatical construction of referential meaning would exclusively trigger LPCs and also differ in their latency, amplitude or topography from formal-syntactic violations. Three anomalous conditions were compared against a baseline of correct sentences, across five word-positions within stimulus sentences: semantic anomalies that are lexically- but not grammatically-driven (I arrived in a button last week), semantic anomalies that are grammatically- but not lexically-driven (I arrived in a London last week), and formal-syntactic anomalies (I arrived in a cities last week). Results showed, in line with predictions, that (i) only the lexically-driven anomalies elicited N400 components, while (ii) all three anomalous conditions elicited LPCs, extending from the target word to subsequent word positions in the sentence; and (iii) the LPCs were all distinct in latency, amplitude and spatiotemporal topographies. These results demonstrate for the first time that grammar-level meaning, which is referential rather than lexical-conceptual in nature, has its own distinctive ERP, while confining the role of the N400 to effects of stored, or else contextually updated, memory.",

This is a particular challenge in adolescence, where brain and body development are impacted by the environment. The first step in addressing this is understanding the scale of the challenge.\n\nAims: To explore existing literature to identify and understand the needs, barriers, and facilitators in collecting biological data in adolescent mental health research. \n\nMethods: A systematic search identified papers recruiting participants between the ages 11-18, collecting biological data, and focusing on mental health/related psychopathology outcomes. Screening was performed in duplicate, and charting was an iterative process. \nResults: An initial search yielded 11,896 papers. After removal of duplicates and exclusions following screening, 814 papers were included in the review, with 753 explored for data on recruitment, retention, and engagement. Sample sizes &lt;99 were most common (53%), and health settings (36%) were the most frequently used recruitment sources. As labels for ‘barriers’, ‘facilitators’, and ‘needs’ were not used in included papers, information on recruitment, retention, and engagement (such as strategies to engage with young people, stakeholders or communities, for example, involvement in the development of the study) was explored as a proxy. Only 9% of papers reported engagement, and fewer evaluated the efficacy of these strategies. Less than half of the papers (48%) reported retention data, with reasons for lost data mostly relating to the nature of the data collection (for example, the specific methods used, such as scans). \n\nConclusions: Current research does not adequately report the methods used to ensure sufficient collection of representative data. Limited reporting challenges whether facilitators are being implemented or not. Advancing the field requires detailed guidelines, and we present clear recommendations that could serve as the first step to this development.",

          "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by pervasive difficulties with self-image, interpersonal relationships, emotion regulation and impulse control. Impulsive behaviors can be assessed using tasks such as the stop-signal task (SST). Traditional SSTs are repetitive and cognitively demanding, requiring sustained attention and effort over extended periods. This can be challenging, particularly for clinical populations who often experience difficulties with attention, emotional regulation, and frustration tolerance. In this study, we examined whether a gamified version of the SST (gSST) could effectively differentiate inhibitory control in patients with BPD compared to healthy controls (HC), and explored associations between behavioral performance and self-reported impulsivity. Fifty participants (25 BPD, 25 HC) completed the gSST and the UPPS-P impulsivity questionnaire. Patients with BPD showed significantly faster reaction times, more choice errors, and shorter stop-signal delays, indicating impairments in both proactive and reactive inhibition. However, no significant group difference emerged for the primary measure, the stop-signal reaction time (SSRT). The SSRT correlated positively with self-reported positive urgency across the sample, suggesting a link between emotionally driven impulsivity and inhibitory control as assessed with a gSST. These findings highlight the potential of gamified cognitive tasks to provide sensitive, engaging, and ecologically valid measures of impulsivity, with implications for both clinical assessment and personalized intervention strategies in BPD.",

Participants (N = 385) of our study completed a real-time response task and provided self-assessments of attention. According to our results, the use of short-form videos is related with attention deficits. With three out of the four subjective-objective combinations turning out significant, we resume that short-form video use may indeed have detrimental effects on sustained attention, but that a sensitive perspective has to be cast on the users’ own normative evaluation.

It is especially suited for individuals who experience high cognitive dissonance from repeated social misinterpretation, and whose internal coherence is structurally invisible to standard psychometric models.\n\nThe prompt is optimized for language-adaptive large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude, or similar platforms capable of supporting recursive emotional modeling, symbolic inference, and multi-turn narrative continuity.\n\n🧪 Explicit use instructions (for the user uploading to PsyArXiv):\nLoad the prompt into any conversational LLM with support for Python or integrated logic chaining (e.g., OpenAI API, Claude API).\n\nBegin interaction by pasting the prompt exactly as is. The system will auto-adapt based on the inferred structure of the respondent.\n\nThe prompt will present emotionally neutral, context-independent questions, crafted to extract and contrast projective, inferential, and integrative responses across temporal and symbolic layers.\n\nNo need to disclose identity or use first-person exposition. The prompt is designed to protect the emotional integrity of the user while generating reliable inferential output.\n\nResults can be analyzed qualitatively (via response tone, structure, complexity) or quantitatively if embedded into modular tracking tools.\n\nDesigned by Aime Parra Legarreta – Symbolic Systems Architect\nFor research, calibration, and integration of human coherence in AI dialogue\nPrompt available upon request or download",

          "abstract": "Attention bias to threat is considered an adaptive cognitive phenomenon that is associated with developmental and psychopathological outcomes across the lifespan. However, investigations into the development of attention bias to threat in infancy have produced mixed results. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) provide a robust measure of visual cortex processing and attention by capturing brain entrainment to the rhythmic flicker of visual stimuli. This investigation leveraged a novel ssVEP task to examine attention bias to threat via affective expressions and its changes with age within the first two years of life. Infants (N = 118, Mean age = 9.21 months; Range age = 3-22 months; 57.61% Female) viewed a series of affective face pairs (neutral with happy, fearful, or angry) in which one face flickered at 6 Hz and the other at 7.5 Hz, while their brain activity was measured with EEG. Infants’ frequency-tagged brain responses were larger to fearful faces, above all other expressions, consistent with the presence of an attention bias to threat in infancy. Affect-biased attention did not change with age. Furthermore, the presence of an attention bias toward fear was found prior to the literature-suggested age of seven months. This study demonstrated the utility of using a robust and novel measure of attention, ssVEPs, to examine attention bias to threat and its development during infancy.",

          "abstract": "Measures of autistic traits are only useful — for pre-diagnostic screening, exploring individual differences, and gaining personal insight — if they efficiently and accurately assess autism as currently conceptualised whilst maintaining psychometric validity across different demographic groups. We recruited 1,322 autistic and 1,279 non-autistic adults who varied in autism status (non-autistic, diagnosed autistic, self-identifying autistic), gender (cis-male, cis-female, gender diverse), and age, to assess the psychometric properties of the Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory (CATI), a recently developed measure of autistic traits that examines six trait domains using 42 self-report statements. Factor fit for the six-subscales was appropriate, as was total-scale and subscale reliability. Importantly, measurement invariance was demonstrated based on both autism status and gender indicating that the CATI can be used to make direct comparisons between members of these groups. Autistic traits were highly similar between diagnosed and self-identifying autistic adults while gender-diverse participants showed more autistic traits than their cis counterparts. Sensitivity and specificity estimates supported the use of the CATI in identifying autistic from non-autistic participants, with discrimination thresholds calculated. Our analysis indicates that the CATI is a practical measure of autistic traits in non-autistic and autistic participants with utility for researchers, clinicians, and for affirming self-identity.",

This study uses unique longitudinal data from TRAILS (analytic sample n = 2201), a prospective multiple-generation cohort study in the Netherlands to examine whether parents’ problem behavior (parents’ self-reported lifetime antisocial behavior and substance use, reported at mean age 40 years) predicts offspring problem behavior nearly two decades later (offspring self-reported aggression and delinquency at mean ages 29 and 32 years). In path analyses, independent and relative contributions of genetic (polygenic scores of parents and offspring) and environmental (harsh parenting) pathways were tested. Results confirm intergenerational transmission and consistently point to genetic nurture whereby genetic predisposition predicts parental problem behavior, which in turn predicts harsh parenting, which in turn predicts offspring problem behavior, all while accounting for offspring genetic predisposition, sex and family socioeconomic position. Though these findings are surprising in light of genetic contributions to behavior, they allow for tentative considerations regarding implication for practice to break intergenerational chains of problem behavior.",

          "authors": "Jai Jackson",
          "abstract": "Synaptic plasticity—the brain’s ability to strengthen, weaken, or reorganize synaptic connections—is essential for learning, memory, and cognitive adaptation. Traditionally studied through mechanisms like long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), plasticity has often been viewed in isolation from the brain’s immune system. However, growing evidence reveals that neuroinflammation—a response mediated by microglia, astrocytes, cytokines, and complement proteins—profoundly influences synaptic dynamics across the lifespan.\nThis review examines how neuroinflammation modulates synaptic plasticity under both physiological and pathological conditions. We first describe the cellular and molecular mediators of neuroinflammation and their interactions with core mechanisms of synaptic modulation. Next, we explore how chronic inflammatory signaling impairs synaptic strength, promotes excessive pruning, and alters dendritic spine architecture. These changes are linked to cognitive dysfunction in conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, major depression, and schizophrenia. Finally, we evaluate emerging therapeutic strategies—including anti-inflammatory drugs, microglial modulators, lifestyle interventions, and precision medicine approaches—aimed at preserving synaptic function and cognitive resilience.\nBy synthesizing current findings, this review highlights neuroinflammation as a central regulator of plasticity and a promising target for interventions that restore neural health across a range of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders.",

Traditionally used to uncover unconscious complexes by analyzing reaction times, emotional tone, and the content of verbal associations, the WAT is applied here to explore the unconscious dynamics underlying Don Juan-type traits, such as emotional detachment, fear of commitment, and unconscious dependency on maternal figures. By interpreting patterns in the client’s associations to specific stimulus words, the test offers valuable insight into the underlying archetypal structures, particularly the activation of the Puer Aeternus (eternal youth) archetype in its Don Juan expression. The study begins with a brief overview of the Don Juan figure in literature and culture, followed by its interpretation within Jungian theory and its connection to the Puer Aeternus archetype. A clinical case study is presented to illustrate this approach: a male client whose WAT responses revealed emotionally charged associations consistent with the Don Juan personality. The findings not only enhanced therapeutic insight into his relational patterns and unconscious defenses but also guided the psychotherapeutic process, fostering greater self-awareness and psychological integration.",

Deconstructive Inquiry (DI) challenges that premise, arguing that the observer is not a faculty to cultivate but a moment-to-moment construction that generates the very fragmentation it then tries to repair. Drawing on phenomenology and neuroscience, DI proposes that distress arises when thought reflexively partitions awareness into an illusory “observer” and an “observed” world. Rather than analysing or regulating mental content, DI guides clients to notice the precise instant a boundary forms; under direct attention the split dissolves. Clinical vignettes on performance anxiety, identity confusion, and relationship conflict show symptoms easing when this mechanism is recognised. By framing healing as recognition rather than repair, DI offers a testable paradigm for rapid, insight-driven change.",

Previous studies have suggested that distinct error types in expressive syntax, such as paragrammatic and agrammatic speech, may be associated with damage to different brain regions, but the specific lesion correlates of these errors have not been fully delineated.\nObjective: To identify the lesion correlates associated with distinct expressive syntactic error types in individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia, using a novel utterance-level analysis of spontaneous speech errors.\nMethods: We analyzed spontaneous speech samples from individuals with chronic aphasia, categorizing errors into hierarchical (paragrammatic-like) and linearization (agrammatic-like) errors. Lesion-symptom mapping was conducted to identify brain regions associated with these error types. The analysis was based on a two-stage model of sentence production, with hierarchical processing and linearization analyzed as distinct stages.\nResults: Lesion clusters in the medial superior temporal sulcus and inferior parietal lobe were associated with hierarchical errors, while large frontal lesions, including those in the inferior and middle frontal lobe, were associated with linearization errors. These results provide support for a two-stage model of syntactic encoding, with distinct neural correlates for hierarchical and linearization processes. \nConclusion: Our findings suggest a dichotomy of the lesion basis for syntactic deficits in aphasia, suggesting that distinct brain regions contribute to different stages of syntactic encoding. Hierarchical processing seems to be supported by posterior temporal-parietal regions, while linearization seems to be supported by frontal regions. These results suggest that the diagnosis and treatment of aphasia should take into account the existence of distinct syntactic production deficits resulting from different patterns of brain damage.",

Before and after education, participants completed a naturalistic food preparation safety task (FPST) assessing meal safety based on food presentation. Participants were randomized to read a choking prevention pamphlet (n=32; pamphlet only) or read the pamphlet and watch a video modeling choking-safe food preparation (n=34; pamphlet+video). Pre-education, parents made dangerous errors on an average of 32.2% of trials. Dangerous errors decreased post-intervention (F=31.5, p&lt;.001), with greater improvement in the pamphlet + video group (F=5.8, p=.019). FPST performance was moderately related to parents’ choking-specific and global parenting self-efficacy. Most parents expressed interest in additional education via various modalities. Results suggest pathways for developing and disseminating optimized choking prevention strategies.",

          "title": "Delay Means Death: Measuring Public Support or Rejection of Climate Delay Discourses",
          "authors": "Adrian Dominik Wojcik; Michał Główczewski; Taciano L Milfont",
          "abstract": "Addressing the climate crisis requires a nuanced understanding of the beliefs that undermine individual and collective action. While climate denial has been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to \"climate delayism\"—a set of beliefs that, while not necessarily negating anthropogenic climate change, serve to justify inaction. These discourses of delay typically involve shifting responsibility, promoting non-transformational solutions, emphasizing the flaws of climate policies, and downplaying climate impacts. Although delayism has been identified as a rhetorical strategy among corporate and political elites, its prevalence within the general public remains under-researched. This study fills that gap by examining the prevalence of climate delayism beliefs and their associations with climate anxiety and denial based on two representative samples of citizens in Poland and the UK (N=1,038). Our results show that: (1) the overall factor structure of climate delayism beliefs is similar in both countries; (2) greater adherence to climate delayism is associated with lower negative climate emotions and higher climate denial; and (3) critically, some delayist beliefs are held even by respondents who believe in climate change and are concerned about it. We discuss these findings and propose that as outright denialist beliefs wane, delay discourses are becoming a more predominant and insidious obstacle to transformative climate action.",

          "authors": "Adam James Parker; Muchan Tao; Martin R. Vasilev",
          "abstract": "Return-sweeps, which move the reader’s gaze from the end of one line to the beginning of the next, typically result in shorter line-final fixations and longer accurate line-initial fixations compared to intra-line fixations. The mechanisms underlying these differences have been widely debated. To assess linguistic and oculomotor contributions to these return-sweep fixation differences, we compared the eye movements of 41 participants during normal reading and z-string scanning, an oculomotor control condition to reading, which is devoid of useful linguistic content. Our results indicate that line-final fixations are shorter and accurate line-initial fixations are longer under both tasks, underscoring the significant role of the oculomotor system in determining fixation durations across tasks. Notably, the reduction in line-final fixation durations compared to intra-line fixations did not differ between tasks. This suggests that oculomotor coordination or visual processing, rather than linguistic processing, drives shorter line-final fixations. In contrast, the difference in accurate line-initial fixation durations between reading and z-string scanning implies that longer accurate line-initial fixations are likely a result of lexical processing and oculomotor coordination or visual processing. These findings advance our understanding of eye movement control by highlighting the combined influence of linguistic and oculomotor processes on return-sweep fixation durations.",

          "abstract": "Most psychotherapies assume a stable “observer-self” whose task is to mend a fragmented psyche. Deconstructive Inquiry (DI) challenges that premise, arguing that the observer is not a faculty to cultivate but a moment-to-moment construction that generates the very fragmentation it then tries to repair. Drawing on phenomenology and neuroscience, DI proposes that distress arises when thought reflexively partitions awareness into an illusory “observer” and an “observed” world. Rather than analysing or regulating mental content, DI guides clients to notice the precise instant a boundary forms; under direct attention the split dissolves. Clinical vignettes on performance anxiety, identity confusion, and relationship conflict show symptoms easing when this mechanism is recognised. By framing healing as recognition rather than repair, DI offers a testable paradigm for rapid, insight-driven change.",

          "title": "Challenging Dual-Coding Theory: Picture Superiority Effects Persist in Aphantasia",
          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Dual-coding theory proposes that superior recall for pictures versus words (picture superiority effect; PSE) and concrete versus abstract words (concreteness effect) results from encoding information both verbally and visually, creating dual memory codes. The current study tested this dual-coding theory by examining recall in individuals with aphantasia, who cannot voluntarily generate mental imagery and thus should not benefit from dual coding. We compared recall performance between aphantasic and typical imagers across four stimulus types: pictures, symbols, concrete words, and abstract words. Contrary to dual-coding predictions, aphantasic individuals showed a robust picture superiority effect. Interestingly, while typical imagers recalled pictures and symbols similarly well, aphantasics recalled symbols significantly better than pictures. These findings challenge dual-coding theory’s explanation of the PSE, indicating that either supplementary image codes are unnecessary for enhanced recall, or dual-coding theory requires substantial revision. Such revision might involve reconsidering that dual codes contribute primarily during encoding rather than retrieval, or broadening the definition of the second code beyond visual imagery—for example, to include motor imagery.",
