          "title": "How are gender and race deployed in disinformation?  An exploratory study of women politicians",
          "authors": "Marília Gehrke",
          "abstract": "Gendered disinformation as violence entails (un)conscious content manipulation to prevent women and gender minorities from further political participation, particularly if these women challenge gender norms and stereotypes. In this exploratory study, I use Brazil's political and social landscape to investigate this phenomenon empirically through quantitative content analysis coupled with framing analysis, applied to fact-checking texts related to six women politicians. Among the results, it was found that low-sophisticated strategies, such as recirculating authentic photos out of their original context, are one of the primary tactics employed to delegitimize these women. In addition, narratives related to crime and morality are among the most recurrent themes used in manipulation, while the frames suggest these political actors are incompetent, manipulative, and futile. The findings were critically analyzed through the lens of critical disinformation studies (Kuo and Marwick, 2021) and decolonial feminisms (e.g., Gonzalez, 2020; Segato, 2016, 2021; Vergès, 2021), suggesting that race, ethnicity, and other identity-based features are relevant markers to continuing to exclude people historically left behind.",

          "authors": "Enja Heikkilä; Andrew Danso; Geoff Luck",
          "abstract": "Video game sound and music have previously been found to influence player engagement and affective responses during gameplay. However, a systematic investigation into the full extent of these effects has not been conducted. This review and meta-analysis examined the influence of music and sound on player emotional (e.g., affective responses) engagement during video game play. 14 studies met the inclusion criteria, with six providing data for meta-analysis on affective valence. Results show that sound and music were able to elevate player engagement during gameplay by positively influencing engagement related domains such as enjoyment, flow, immersion and motivation. Sound and music had a significant positive effect on affective valence (g = 0.409, 95% CI [0.109, 0.709]; p = 0.007). Sensitivity analysis showed a consistent significant effect, with low heterogeneity (g = 0.287, 95% CI [0.113, 0.462]; p = 0.001; I² = 0%). Study quality was generally high, with 11 out of the 14 studies rated for a low risk of bias. There is promising evidence for video game sound and music to improve player engagement and affective responses during gameplay, yet further research as well as standardization of methodology is required to better understand the underlying mechanisms in this emerging area.",

          "authors": "Krishma Labib; María de los Ángeles Crespo López; Claudia Pallise Perello; Jeroen de Ridder",
          "abstract": "The open science (OS) movement is growing, with increasing policies, guidelines, tools and infrastructures being developed to support researchers who engage in OS practices. However, there is no widely accepted single definition of OS. Different initiatives and countries employ a variety of characterizations. To chart how OS is understood in different parts of the world, we conducted a scoping review and critical discourse analysis of OS guidance documents aimed at researchers. Our search led to the inclusion of 69 national and international documents, with most originating from North America, Europe, and Latin America. Our results show that OS discourses are exaggerated, framing OS as the solution to address all scientific and societal problems. Furthermore, they provide often conflicting ideas about what OS can achieve. Many guidance documents frame OS as a tool to promote economic growth and efficiency. Others see OS as necessary to safeguard research quality and reproducibility through transparency. In contrast, few documents address knowledge equity and inclusion. Taking this into account, we see dominant OS discourses reproducing knowledge equity problems already present in research, rather than tackling them. We urge researchers be more precise about the specific approach they take to OS and more humble about the effects it can have – both positive, and negative.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: The Guidelines for Reporting Reliability and Agreement Studies (GRRAS) were developed to improve the completeness and transparency of reporting of reliability and agreement of health measurement instruments. However, since their publication in 2011 methodological standards, both for reporting guideline development and reliability, agreement, and measurement error studies, have advanced, highlighting the need for aligning and updating. In addition, related initiatives like COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) have emerged, offering opportunities to harmonize terminology and promote consistency across diverse types of measurement instruments. This methods review aims (1) to systematically identify and synthesize commentaries on and evaluations of the original GRRAS, and (2) to map recent methodological developments in the planning, conduct, and interpretation of reliability, agreement and measurement error studies that should be reflected in the reporting and may imply or explicitly recommend updates, to inform the development of the GRRAS-COSMIN reporting guidelines. \nMethods and analysis: Two complementary search strategies will be employed. First, forward direct citation tracking of the original GRRAS publications will be conducted in Web of Science. We will include sources providing critique, commentaries, or suggestions related to the GRRAS. We will exclude publications that used GRRAS just for structuring their report, withdrawn or retracted articles, textbooks, peer reviews, supplements, and conference materials without full-text publications. Included articles will be analysed using descriptive content analysis. Second, we will perform a systematic search in Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, Eric, and Cinahl supplemented by key references identified by or known to the author team. We will include studies, reviews, commentaries, editorials, methodological papers, tutorials and guidance documents that discuss or critically reflect on methodological aspects of the measurement properties reliability and/or agreement/measurement error published between 01.01.2015 and 31.07.2025 in the field of health measurement research. Eligibility will be assessed by two independent reviewers and included sources will be analysed using ‘codebook’ thematic analysis. Findings will be presented narratively supplemented by visuals and tables if appropriate.\nEthics and dissemination: This study involves publicly available data. No ethical approval is needed. Results will be disseminated through an open-access journal publication following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Scoping Review Extension and conference presentations.",

          "authors": "Samantha R. O'Connell; Joel S. Snyder; Grace E. Wilson; Dan H Berkowitz; Erin Hannon",
          "abstract": "Groove is the pleasurable urge to move to the beat of music, a universally experienced human phenomenon. Because listeners are often inspired to move to music with groove, we asked whether high-groove music would promote greater motor system activity than low-groove music, noise, or silence, as shown by shorter latency and/or greater amplitude of the lateralized readiness potential (LRP), an event-related potential measure of neural response preparation and execution in the primary motor cortex. In Experiment 1, 21 participants were presented with one of two symbols (@ and #) on a computer monitor and pressed a button with their left or right hand, depending on which symbol was presented, while listening to high-groove music, low-groove music, noise, or silence. Throughout the duration of the experiment, electroencephalography was recorded at the scalp and we calculated stimulus-locked and response-locked activity by averaging across correctly responded, non-artifact trials. In Experiment 2, 31 participants were tested with the same stimuli, procedure, and analysis, with the following exception: instead of responding to visual stimuli, participants pressed a button with their left or right hand, depending on whether they heard an occasional increase or decrease in intensity in the music or noise. None of the analyses in either experiment showed differences in LRP latency or amplitude between the high-groove or low-groove conditions. Several of the analyses yielded Bayes Factor values greater than 3 in favor of the null hypothesis. Thus, we found no evidence that high-groove music enhances activity in the primary motor cortex. Future studies should use other brain activity measurement and manipulation techniques to conceptually replicate our findings, including techniques that can separately measure different motor and auditory cortical areas.",

          "abstract": "Mental imagery is theorised to support important mental simulation processes, yet there remains little direct evidence of its functional impact on moral, emotional, and motivational processes. This pre-registered study examined whether the ability to generate visual mental imagery amplifies magical thinking responses to mentally constructed emotional events. Using a modified laboratory harm provocation paradigm, participants with aphantasia (minimal or absent visual imagery; N = 32) and visualisers (normal to high imagery ability; N = 48) were asked to write and elaborate on the sentence “I hope [name of a loved one] is in a car accident”, followed by an episodic elaboration phase to ensure both groups engaged in concrete-experiential mental processing of the specific event. The Visualiser group reported significantly higher anxiety, guilt, moral violation, responsibility, and urge to neutralise the thought relative to Aphantasic participants, despite similar perceptions of event likelihood and severity, and after accounting for the effects of age and trait magical thinking. However, neutralisation behaviour did not differ between groups. Mental imagery ratings and episodic detail reports confirmed that visualisers generated richer sensory representations of the imagined event. These findings support emulation theory by demonstrating that scene-based mental imagery amplifies emotional and motivational responses to hypothetical events, contributing to the phenomenological intensity of intrusive thoughts. The results have implications for understanding the cognitive mechanisms underlying magical thinking and compulsive behaviours. Results suggest that aphantasia may confer reduced vulnerability to such responses.",

          "authors": "Matthew Vanaman; Roger D. Peng",
          "abstract": "Psychologists should analyze their data well rather than badly, but how do we know whether they are actually good at analyzing data in the real world? Currently, there is a dearth of empirically-grounded criteria for assessing real-world analytic skill, leaving us to judge analysts’ decisions on the uncertain or even arbitrary standards of routine, disciplinary norms, or what “feels right” or “seems off”. This knowledge gap is surprising given widespread concerns about low replication, high rates of questionable research practices, and the recent proliferation of data science initiatives both within and beyond psychology purporting to increase job-readiness for data-intensive workplaces. We address this gap by introducing and validating a new construct: analytic fluency, or real-world analytic decision-making that consistently produces trustworthy, informative, and reliable analyses across contexts. Drawing on interviews with experienced analysts, we identify and validate four distinct dimensions of analytic skill: Analyzing Flexibly, Appreciating the Importance of Data, Prioritizing Stakeholder Needs, and Striving for Simplicity. We show analytic fluency scores are predicted by real analytic experience, are empirically distinct from statistical knowledge, and show no bias by gender, race/ethnicity, or education level. By naming and measuring analytic fluency, we address a longstanding conceptual and empirical gap in knowledge about how data analysis is, and ought to be, carried out in practice. In so doing, we take a first small step toward scientifically defining what it means to be skilled at data analysis.",

          "abstract": "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a portable, non-invasive neuroimaging technique that is well-suited for project-based undergraduate neuroscience research methods courses. In this paper, we first explain the basic principles of fNIRS including how it measures neural activity as well as its strengths and limitations. Next, we explain why fNIRS is well-suited for an undergraduate project-based human neuroscience methods classroom. We then lay out what skills students gain by designing an fNIRS study and collecting and analyzing the data. Finally, we provide a concrete guide to do this in the classroom including a timeline, example projects, and potential problems and how to address them. We hope this will inspire educators to use this powerful yet accessible tool for education in human neuroscience research in a wide variety of educational environments.",

          "abstract": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), has introduced powerful tools for various research domains, including psychological scale development. This study presents a methodology for efficiently generating and selecting high-quality, non-redundant items for psychological assessments using LLMs and network psychometrics. Our approach, termed Automatic Item Generation with Network-Integrated Evaluation (AI-GENIE), reduces reliance on expert intervention by integrating generative AI with the latest network psychometric techniques. The efficacy of AI-GENIE was evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations using the Mixtral, Gemma 2, Llama 3, GPT 3.5, and GPT 4o models to generate item pools that mimic Big Five personality assessments. Additionally, items from AI-GENIE were empirically tested with five nationally representative U.S. samples (N = 4,964 total), demonstrating that AI-GENIE-generated scales achieve structural validity comparable to traditional expert-developed measures. The results demonstrated improvements in item selection efficiency, with overall average increases of 8.68-20.03 in normalized mutual information in the final item pool across all models. We also present a simulation study on the emerging construct of AI Anxiety to demonstrate AI-GENIE’s utility for underrepresented constructs. Results from newly released models (DeepSeek, GPT-OSS 20B, GPT-OSS 120B) are presented in the Appendix. The findings of our paper suggest that AI-GENIE is a highly effective tool for streamlining the scale development and validation process.",

          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic presented numerous novel stressors to youth which have been associated with worsening mental health. Previous work has shown that individuals with high reward sensitivity show resilience in the face of individualized stressors. Here, we sought to investigate whether individuals with high reward sensitivity prior to pandemic onset would be resilient to the community-level stressor of the pandemic. Sensitivity to reward was defined here as neural activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and striatum for wins as compared to losses in a reward-based task. We used data from the Human Connectome Project in Development collected before the pandemic onset, and follow-up data which was collected from the same participants during the pandemic. Activity in the left vmPFC moderated the association between pandemic-related stressors and internalizing psychopathology. Although those with low reward sensitivity showed a positive association between exposure to stressors and psychopathology, those with high sensitivity to reward did not show increased symptoms with increased stressors. We found no effect of activity in the striatum or right vmPFC on the association between stressors and psychopathology. These findings add to a growing literature highlighting reward sensitivity, measured prior to stressor onset, as a source of stress resilience.",

          "abstract": "Alcohol consumption can pose health risks and cause social problems, hence harmful drinking is a global health concern. Acculturation has been theorized and examined as a key driver for drinking behaviors. In this State of the Science article, we define sociocultural and psychological acculturation, and describe three causal theories associated with socialization and learning, stress and coping, and accessibility and opportunity. Data have shown small-to-moderate associations linking acculturation factors to drinking outcomes. Many existing studies measure acculturation with demographic proxies and static cultural orientation indicators. Underlying causal mechanisms are typically inferred rather than tested directly, with limited focus on key proximal factors such as stress responses, drinking motives, and cultural norms. Furthermore, current alcohol interventions lack alignment with acculturation science and fail to target modifiable, drinking-related factors. To advance the field and bridge research-to-practice gaps, studies should move beyond broad demographic markers and examine systematically the psychological and social pathways linking acculturation to alcohol use. We advocate for the adoption of context-specific measures, daily life study methods to capture acculturation’s dynamic effects on drinking, and research across diverse global populations. We call for the field to integrate the acculturation framework into the broader alcohol research and mainstream interventions to address individual and cultural variations in drinking behaviors, incorporate sociocultural influences into existing models of alcohol use to bridge gaps in generalizability, and enhance intervention effectiveness.",

          "authors": "Matthew Zefferman",
          "abstract": "As researchers broaden samples to populations that are not Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD), they often use instruments, such as questionnaires, designed for WEIRD populations. Does this practice create systematic biases when making cross-cultural comparisons? Inspired by the example of less apparent structural complexity in personality data outside of WEIRD populations, I show with computational models that designing a personality instrument for a reference, typically WEIRD, population and applying it to a novel population will systematically underestimate the relative complexity of the novel population. This occurs because instruments optimized to capture the personality structure of one society fail to capture alternative structures in other societies. The models also make the novel quantitative prediction that a society's \"cultural distance\" from the reference society should tend to be negatively associated with the apparent complexity of its personality structure. To test this prediction, I used pre-existing cross-cultural personality and cultural distance datasets to show that cultural distance from the United States, from which the reference personality instrument was designed, has the strongest negative relationship with the complexity of the personality structure, as measured by the instrument, out of all 67 countries in the dataset. This result duplicates an outcome of the model. These findings suggest that lower apparent complexity in non-WEIRD groups may be driven by the choice of WEIRD instruments, rather than by actual differences in complexity. These biases would also tend to occur in any case where an instrument designed for one group is applied to another, such as different genders or cohorts. I propose possible reforms to avoid this type of bias.",

A secondary aim was to identify potential outcomes for a pilot randomized controlled trial.\n\nMethods\nFollowing Bartholomew’s Intervention Mapping protocol, we conducted a literature review and four stakeholder focus groups to explore needs and inform intervention design.\nResults\nThe digital module STORY MINE was developed and integrated into the online client portal ‘Minddistrict’ at a major Dutch mental health facility. It offers twelve hopeful RNs in three modalities: video podcast, audio, and text. Hypothesized outcomes include improved mental health confidence (primary outcome) and enhanced hope, reduced self-stigma, and better personal recovery (secondary outcomes). \n\nConclusion\nOur study pioneers a targeted, evidence-based approach by purposively collecting recovery narratives that include identified active ingredients to develop a RN based intervention called STORY MINE.

          "authors": "Aleksandra Lazić; Iris Zezelj",
          "abstract": "The proportion of the population who are vaccinated against an infectious disease is significant – not only because vaccination keeps the virus from spreading, but also because learning about how many members of one’s community have decided to get vaccinated has been shown to affect individual vaccination intention. In three preregistered online experiments featuring country-level vaccination rates against a hypothetical disease, we tested two theoretical approaches which offer contrasting predictions on how public health messaging should leverage vaccination rates. If selfish rationality is assumed, a high uptake would tempt people to free-ride on herd immunity (so low uptake should be emphasized); conversely, if vaccination rates exert a descriptive normative influence, a high uptake would signal that vaccination is the best choice, and vice versa (so high uptake should be emphasized). In the pilot (N = 75) and Experiment 1 (N = 174), communicating a high (90%) vaccination rate (vs. 10% vs. no rate) increased vaccination intentions, with no detectable effect of a low vaccination rate. In Experiment 2 (N = 217), decisions to get vaccinated were frequently justified based on reasons involving self-protection, but also the protection of others and the collective, irrespective of the vaccination rate level (20% vs. 80%); participants, on the other hand, rarely endorsed any of the tested reasons for non-vaccination, including free-riding; furthermore, descriptive norms were perceived as more relevant for vaccination than non-vaccination decisions. Experiment 3 (N = 1,060) tested the effectiveness of different messages when the majority have been vaccinated (60%) but the coverage is still not optimal. Alongside a weak descriptive norm, the self-benefit message worked better than other- and collective-benefit messages. We argue that public health messaging should incorporate both theoretical approaches, closer to the notion of reasonableness (rather than pure rationality or normativity), which is context-sensitive and pragmatic.",

          "abstract": "The \"shape bias\"—the tendency to generalize new nouns by their shape rather than features like color or texture—is considered a cornerstone of early noun learning. However, the magnitude, development, and cross-cultural generality of this bias remain debated. We conducted a pre-registered meta-analysis and meta-regression of 71 studies to synthesize the evidence base. Our analysis revealed a robust overall effect, confirming the existence of a shape bias. However, this effect was characterized by extreme between-study heterogeneity (I² = 0.95). Critically, meta-regression analyses failed to support hypothesized developmental changes, with a constant model across ages providing the most parsimonious fit. The literature is overwhelmingly dominated by studies of English-speaking children, preventing meaningful tests of cross-linguistic or cross-cultural variation. We also found strong statistical evidence of publication bias, suggesting that the true effect size could be inflated in the published literature. Together, these findings indicate that procedural variation, besides a potential publication bias, more than currently testable theoretical moderators, account for the variability in the literature, severely limiting the ability to distinguish between theories of the shape bias's origins.",

However, the relationship between these constructs is debated: does essentialism cause pro-LGB attitudes, or is it motivated by preexisting pro-LGB attitudes? In an experimental test of the motivated model, we presented participants across three studies (N = 750) with a passage either promoting or critiquing “born this way” narratives. Those in the “Born this way”-critical conditions demonstrated significantly less sexual orientation essentialism than those in the “Born this way”-supportive conditions, with condition effects particularly strong among liberals. Crucially, effects on essentialism were similar regardless of whether the critique was grounded in epistemic reasons (i.e., “born this way” is inaccurate) or moral motivations (i.e., “born this way” is harmful). There were no condition differences in pro-LGB attitudes. Thus, we find support for the motivated model: moral arguments alone can prompt the strategic attenuation of essentialism.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In autism spectrum condition (ASC), altered predictions (priors) or prediction errors have been hypothesized to increase the influence of bottom-up sensory input, relative to top-down prior knowledge. Such alterations could account for several autistic features, but their empirical basis is unclear. In neurotypical individuals (NT), multiple neuroimaging meta-analyses have aimed to outline domain-general ‘prediction networks’ of the brain. However, there has not been a similar meta-analysis in autism.\nMETHODS: We searched the literature for functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography studies with autistic participants. The contrasts that explicitly or implicitly involved the processing of priors/predictions and prediction errors were selected. Contrasts were divided into those that reported stronger activation in the ASC group compared to the NT group, and vice versa. We then tested the convergence of differences between the groups in two activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses.\nRESULTS: Activation differences in eight contrasts reporting stronger activation in ASC compared to NT (139 ASC; 150 NT) did not result in significant convergence. Activation differences in 13 contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC (261 ASC; 289 NT) converged in a cluster in the medial frontal gyrus/cingulate gyrus. Additionally, we identified 38 contrasts without significant group differences.\nCONCLUSION: We found converging activation differences (from contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC) in an area associated with error monitoring and uncertainty estimation. Our results are generally consistent with notions of altered priors/predictions or prediction errors in autism, pointing to differences at high levels of the information-processing hierarchy. However, we recommend a cautious interpretation, given the limited number of available contrasts and the high proportion of null results.",

          "abstract": "The present study presents the results of a collaborative registered replication of Griskevicius et al. (2010, Experiment 1). As part of the Collaborative Replication and Education Project, 24 student groups from six countries (N = 3,774) investigated whether pro-environmental behavior can be promoted by priming status motives (desires for social status and prestige). This large, multi-site replication showed no evidence to support the hypothesis that hypothetical pro-environmental behavior can be stimulated by having participants read a story designed to prime status motives. We performed several exploratory analyses to investigate whether extension variables (i.e., equating “green” choices with prosocial behavior, political beliefs, sampling methods, location, duration of data collection, and gender) moderated the hypothesized effect of status motives on pro-environmental choices, but these analyses produced null results. One limitation of the study is that most data collection sites did not include a manipulation check, and the one site that did found a much weaker effect (d = 0.32) than the extremely large effect originally reported (d = 3.78). As a result, it remains unclear whether the null result reflects a failure of this specific priming method or a challenge to the underlying theory.

          "abstract": "It was studied how a history of peer victimization contributes to within-person affective processes in adolescents (15 years old, N=86, 42 female and 44 male, primarily Dutch). Using experience sampling, we assessed negative affect (NA) and social stress appraisal (SS). Hypotheses and statistical analyses were pre-registered. Results showed that greater peer victimization history related to increased SS, NA, and NA persistence (i.e., higher inertia). These findings align with the social information processing model and prevention hypothesis, demonstrating that peer victimization takes an emotional toll on adolescents, leading to increased social stress, negative affect, and increased persistence of negative affect. Understanding these impacts is crucial for understanding how peer victimization may lead to emotional difficulties over time.",

This experimental study investigated how personal photographs’ visual perspective (first-person vs. third-person) influences recall of positive memories depending on dysphoria. Eighty-five participants (42 low dysphoria, 43 high dysphoria) submitted photos of positive events from both perspectives. Later, participants recalled these events while viewing either a first- or third-person photo and rated and described their memory. While first-person photos promoted more field-perspective recall regardless of dysphoria level, dysphoria was still associated with greater observer recall, reduced mental imagery, and lower internal episodic detail. Additionally, dysphoria predicted less focus on the meaning of pictured events in general, and lower positive and higher negative emotional impact of recalling the events in the presence of first-person photo cues. Thus, while photo cues can shift memory vantage point, but emotional engagement remains constrained by mood-related biases.",

In both experiments, participants showed a preference for a high level of cognitive conflict, evaluated it as effortful yet enjoyable and linked it to positive emotions. Overall, these findings suggest that cognitive conflict, not effort, is valued and functions as an intrinsic reward, challenging the neuroeconomic approach to cognitive control theories toward a hedonic perspective.",

          "abstract": "Recovery narratives (RNs) could potentially be beneficial for service users, leading to hope and a sense of recognition. It remains understudied how to adequately implement these in mental health treatment. To gather input for the development of a RN intervention, we organized focus groups (FGs) with SMI service users (n=6), autism service users (n=3), peer support workers (n=4) and other health care professionals (n=4). The audio recorded sessions followed a semi-structured interview format addressing nine topics, including the potential of RNs as an intervention, platform to offer RNs and considerations regarding sharing your own RN. Consensus of the thematic analysis of the transcripts was finalized after a member check. Analysis of the nine interview topics resulted into six major themes: 1) Potential positive vs. negative effects; 2) Narrative content and modality; 3) Public availability vs. anonymity; 4) Freedom vs. structure; 5) Platform structuring; and 6) Contact options and emotional support. Member checking confirmed credibility of the findings. Developing a structured yet tailored RN intervention as part of mental healthcare treatment seems promising. Several important considerations need to be taken into account, such as practical and hopeful RN content, to increase the potential for recovery promoting effects.",

          "abstract": "Accurate numerical estimation underlies many aspects of cognition, from basic quantity judgments to complex decision-making. One domain where numerical reasoning is especially critical is memory, where individuals often must estimate the likelihood that one event or idea is associated with another. In this study, participants completed a free association task across multiple sessions to generate their own individualized word-pair norms. Later, they provided numerical probability judgments (0–100%) of how often they had produced each pair. These judgments were compared to collective free association norms, a matched group evaluating others’ pairs, and a traditional control group. Results showed that participants who judged their own pairs were significantly more accurate in estimating associative probabilities than control or matched groups, reflecting the benefits of expertise derived from repeated interaction with stimuli. However, systematic overestimation bias persisted, especially for weak associations, indicating that metacognitive sensitivity to probability differences remains limited. These findings highlight how expertise improves, but does not perfect, the ability to translate memory associations into numerical judgments, offering new insights into the intersection of numerical cognition, metacognition, and memory.",

          "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by imbalances in homeostatic processes as reflected in altered neural function at rest. Within the insular cortex, distinct subregions have been associated with predictive or evaluative coding of homeostatic states. However, it is still elusive if functional segregation of insular subregions is impaired in MDD.\n\nTo test for loss of specificity within functional connectivity (FC) profiles of insular subregions in MDD, we measured resting-state fMRI in 433 patients with MDD and 417 healthy control participants (HCP) and compared the similarity (Pearson correlation) and density (shift function) between 6 subregional FC profiles for MDD and HCP. To evaluate the clinical utility of similarity of FC profiles, we tested whether MDD can be classified on an individual level.\n\nWe found greater similarity between FC profiles of insular subregions in MDD compared to HCP which was driven by a decrease in similarity and a greater FC density within the anterior insular cortex (AIC). On the individual level, insular FC profiles significantly predicted MDD, but the accuracy scaled with symptom severity.\n\nLoss of functional segregation and a greater FC density within the AIC may indicate alterations in interoceptive signals at rest in MDD. The increase in predictive power with increasing symptom severity substantiates insular functional segregation as an index of pathophysiology and supports a model in which prolonged deviations from homeostasis might drive individuals into an energy-deficient state that characterizes depression.",

          "abstract": "A common belief is that we only truly appreciate things or people when we are about to lose them. This phenomenon is often observed in real-world scenarios, such as when people place greater value on a meeting with a friend who is about to leave or in marketing, where consumers are willing to pay more for a flight when only a few tickets remain available. But why does this happen? This paper explores the dynamics behind this behavior, focusing on how subjective value increases as reference standards—considered as expectations about the future availability of events—decrease over time. We introduce a computational model to investigate the relationship between subjective value and the probability of exerting effort to attain an event under varying reference standards. The model demonstrates how deviations from these reference standards influence the perceived value of an event, with the likelihood of exerting effort rising as the perceived value increases relative to alternatives. Through simulations, we explore the psychological and economic implications of reference-dependent valuation, offering insights into how changes in perceived value drive effortful decision-making. The findings shed light on reference-dependent behavior in both everyday and high-stakes decision-making contexts.",

Although the goal of such a procedure is to promote these peoples’ insight in their moment-to-moment experiences, the extent to which they gain insight from their personalized feedback has not yet been quantified. In this study, we quantified whether participants (N = 100) gained insight from their personalized feedback in a pre-post- design. We provided participants with a novel type of feedback about frequency distributions of their affective experiences as captured by EMA data. We compared this feedback to frequency distributions that participants estimated of all their affective experiences, both before before and after seeing their feedback. We found that participants’ initial estimates were often close to their personalized feedback. However, there were large interindividual differences in this difference score, as well as the extent to which participants changed their initial estimate in response to the personalized feedback. Overall, participants changed their estimates such that the means and standard deviations of the distributions were closer to those of their feedback. However, the means and standard deviations of participant’s estimated distributions - both before and after receiving feedback - were usually higher than those of the respective feedback. These latter findings can either be interpreted as a persistent retrospective bias towards salient experiences, or a shortcoming of EMA data to capture salient experiences.",

          "abstract": "The persuasive power of social media influencers has been well-demonstrated in the context of commercial goals, but whether influencers can be successfully employed for health messages and in particular fear appeals remain unclear. The current research explores two factors that may enhance the effectiveness of persuasive health messages using influencers: whether media users have a pre-existing bond, i.e., parasocial relationship (PSR) with the influencer, and whether the influencer directly addresses the user on a verbal and bodily level. In two online experiments, female social media users (18-30 y/o) were exposed to a set of fictional Instagram posts on eating disorder prevention. Study 1 (N = 233) employed a 2 (pre-existing PSR: yes vs. no) x 2 (verbal addressing: yes vs. no) between-subjects design. Study 2 (N = 225) used a 2 (verbal addressing: yes vs. no) x 2 (bodily addressing: yes vs. no) between-subjects design. The results showed that messages conveyed by an influencer with whom media users had a pre-existing (vs. no) parasocial relationship elicited higher parasocial interaction (PSI), which was in turn associated with an increase in message-supporting thoughts and subsequently behavioral intentions (assessed immediately) and actual behavior (assessed one week after message reception). No significant effects of verbal and bodily addressing were found. Employing influencers for eating disorder prevention seems most effective when individuals have a parasocial friendship with the influencer. Future research should explore if and how direct addressing can be effectively applied in social media health campaigns.",

          "abstract": "Background: Cardiac anxiety (CA) is a commonly occurring condition in populations with both cardiac and mental health conditions. It is assessed using the CA questionnaire (CAQ), which has been translated to several languages and its validity and reliability has been investigated using classical test theory. The factor structure of the CAQ remains uncertain, and no study has investigated the psychometric properties of the CAQ using modern test theory approaches. The aim of this study was to use Rasch analysis to test the validity and reliability of the original 18-item CAQ in a Swedish sample of patients with myocardial infarction, as well as other scales, based on previous findings.\nMethods: Participants were 754 patients after myocardial infarction with preserved cardiac function. Data were fitted to the Rasch model, investigating dimensionality, ordering of response categories, invariance, targeting and measurement uncertainty. Additionally, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted using a weighted least mean squares estimator and dynamic fit indices.\nResults: All three subscales indicated problems with dimensionality and several items had disordered response categories, and with some of them minimal distance between steps. Many items displayed local dependency. There were also small problems with differential item functioning. Person locations were lower than the item threshold locations, but there were no significant floor or ceiling effects. The CFA also demonstrated a poor model fit of the three subscales in the 18-item version of the CAQ. An iterative removal of items resulted in a modified 10-item version still with questionable poor reliability.\nConclusions: The original 18-item version of the CAQ did not fit the Rasch model. The major problems with the 18-item version were dimensionality, local dependency, and disordered response categories. No other version of the CAQ achieved acceptable fit to the Rasch model. These results indicate that the CAQ is lacking in terms of reliability and a revision of the scale is called for.",

          "abstract": "Deliberative, effortful thinking supports better reasoning about science, politics, and everyday problems, but what drives its engagement remains unclear. One possibility is that low confidence acts as a trigger for deliberation. Across four preregistered experiments (N ≈ 1,200), we provide a causal test of this hypothesis. Participants received manipulated feedback about their performance on classic reasoning problems (bat-and-ball or base-rate tasks) presented in standard, single response formats (Studies 1-2) or two-response formats in which participants give both a timed and an untimed response for each problem (Studies 3-4). In the single-response studies, negative feedback reliably reduced confidence and increased response times compared to control and positive feedback. In the two-response studies, negative feedback again reduced confidence and lengthened response times. Critically, it also increased the likelihood of revising initial answers and prolonged second-stage response times—hallmarks of deliberation. Moreover, feedback-affected confidence, measured immediately after initial, timed responses and before deliberation was possible, predicted both revisions and extended second-stage processing. Together, these findings offer robust causal evidence that confidence regulates the deployment of deliberative reasoning and clarify what makes us “think it through”.",

Suicidal behavior disorder (SBD), included in DSM-5 for research purposes, has not yet been examined in this population.\nMethods: In a sample of N = 103 treatment-seeking refugees, SBD prevalence was assessed using a clinical interview. Associations between suicidality (presence and severity) and risk factors—gender, age, PTSD, disorders of self-organization (DSO), depression, insecure asylum status, flight duration, postmigration living difficulties (PMLD)—as well as the protective factor religiosity were examined via univariate and multivariate analyses.\nResults: SBD prevalence was 14.41% (n = 15). DSO and an insecure asylum status were associated with the presence of suicidality in univariate and multivariate analyses and with the severity of suicidality in multivariate analyses. Sexual trauma frequency was associated with the presence of suicidality, while PTSD severity and lower religiosity were linked to greater suicidality severity. Depressive symptoms were associated with suicidality only in univariate analyses.\nConclusion: Suicidality should be systematically assessed in treatment-seeking refugees, particularly those with DSO or an insecure asylum status. Brief suicide prevention interventions may be warranted when treatment duration is uncertain, and targeted PTSD treatments should be offered when indicated.",

While previous reviews of studies primarily employing self-report scales indicate that illbeing and wellbeing are distinct yet interconnected constructs, a deeper examination of their relationship is lacking. In this Perspective, we synthesize genetic, biological, developmental, psychosocial, societal, cultural, and clinical research on illbeing and wellbeing. Our review reveals substantial genetic overlap and similar biological underpinnings for illbeing and wellbeing. In contrast, environmental factors and societal changes often exert divergent influences. We propose a differentiated multidisciplinary framework in which the shared and unique determinants, predictors, mechanisms, and consequences of mental illbeing and wellbeing vary across levels of analysis, offering a more nuanced understanding of the interconnections.",

          "abstract": "A growing body of research has investigated the emergence and developmental trajectory of children’s information search abilities. In this paper, we examine the capacity of 2- to 4-year-olds to identify and select the most informative cue among several options when searching for a hidden reward—a common task in decision-making research where young children have traditionally struggled. Across two experiments—including a preregistered replication—we tested 111 children (56 female) aged 24 to 59 months using a simplified version of Lindow’s (2021) finding-presents game. Children were presented with three cue cards (e.g., color, shape, icon) to determine which box contained a hidden present. Because only one feature differentiated the target box (for example, all boxes were blue and had a sticker on top, but varied in shape), only one cue card provided informative guidance. The children’s choices of cue cards served as the primary dependent measure. In Experiment 1, children aged 2 to 4 selected the relevant cue card at rates significantly above chance. Experiment 2 focused specifically on 2-year-olds and demonstrated that their choices were not driven by a saliency heuristic. Together, these findings reveal the early emergence of pre-decisional information search abilities in preschoolers and introduce a straightforward, effective paradigm for assessing early information-seeking skills.",

          "authors": "MohammadHossein Manuel Haqiqatkhah; Ellen Hamaker",
          "abstract": "Multilevel cosinor models can be used to study individual differences in circadian rhythms in intensive longitudinal data (ILD) obtained with experience sampling or passive sensing throughout the day. This allows examining how individuals differ with respect to their overall level, strength of trend, and peak timings, and how these relate to each other and other covariates. However, current estimation methods in psychology suffer from critical but overlooked flaws. Specifically, standard approaches cannot properly test for a cycle's absence. We demonstrate with empirical data that a majority of individuals may not have a cycle at all. Additionally, and more critically,  these techniques ignore the circular nature of peak timing defined on a 24-hour clock. This oversight leads to inaccurate peak time estimates (off by many hours) with vastly inflated uncertainty, both individually (level-1) and on average (level-2). The severity of these issues hinges on the clock time the researcher assumes a cycle starts. Furthermore, conventional correlation measures involving peak timing become uninterpretable, as their sign, strength, and significance are dependent on the same arbitrary decision. To resolve these pitfalls, we integrate methods from circular statistics within a robust Bayesian framework, allowing researchers to assess whether or not cycles are present, obtain accurate peak estimates, and utilize proper circular-linear correlation measures. Using empirical affective and heart rate data, we demonstrate the practical severity of these issues. We conclude with a call for the behavioral sciences to integrate well-established methods from other fields and propose a foundation for future research involving multimodal data.",

          "abstract": "The sense of presence and the sense of reality are often treated as distinct phenomena—presence as the feeling of \"being there\" in a virtual environment and reality as the ability to discern ‘real’ from ‘false’ phenomena. We argue that these concepts are identical  both conceptually and mechanistically, despite much VR research defining presence as something which much necessarily take place in VR. We then introduce specific instances of converging evidence between the fields, suggesting that presence and reality are likely to be constituted by the same integrative theoretical models, psychophysical mechanisms and neural architecture. Evidence from neuroimaging supports this claim, revealing overlapping brain regions involved in both presence and reality perception. This reconceptualization of VR presence as reality has implications  for research on consciousness, psychiatric disorders involving reality perception, and the use of virtual reality as a tool for studying and modifying perceptual experience. Future research should directly compare presence and reality mechanisms to explore their functional and neural equivalence, potentially redefining how we study consciousness and perception.",

All parents were female (100%), with many being part-time employed (39%), White (48%) with at least 2 children (48%).\nResults: Perceived barriers to child healthy eating behaviours in low-income families attributed to the TDF domains ‘Environmental Context and Resources’, ‘Social Influences’, ‘Behavioural Regulation’, ‘Beliefs about Capabilities’, and ‘Beliefs about Consequences’. These link to four of the COM-B model elements Physical Opportunity, Social Opportunity, Psychological Capability, and Reflective Motivation.  Perceived facilitators of how parents can improve their children’s healthy eating during the Cost-of-Living Crisis were ‘Environmental Context and Resources’, ‘Behavioural Regulation’, ‘Knowledge’, ‘Memory, Attention and Decision-making processes’, and ‘Social Influences’.

          "abstract": "Contemporary human-AI interaction research currently faces a significant limitation: existing frameworks are inadequate to explain how artificial intelligence systems fundamentally reshape human cognition before conscious awareness occurs. This preprocessing influence, which operates beneath the threshold of deliberate thought, represents a crucial missing layer in the understanding of distributed cognition. This paper introduces \"Cognitive Infrastructure Studies\" (CIS) as a new interdisciplinary domain to reconceptualize AI as \"cognitive infrastructures\". Cognitive infrastructures – e.g., search engines, recommender systems, algorithmic curation platforms, and large language models - exhibit classic infrastructural properties: they are invisible in normal operation, becoming visible only upon breakdown; they are embedded in social and technical arrangements; they are learned as part of membership in digital communities; they link with conventions of practice; and they embody standards that shape what counts as appropriate, relevant, or true. Yet cognitive infrastructures possess distinctive characteristics that distinguish them from traditional infrastructures. Unlike physical infrastructures that passively transport matter or energy, cognitive infrastructures have agency, filtering and curating individuals’ perception of reality before it reaches human consciousness.  Through narrative scenarios spanning individual (cognitive dependency), collective (democratic deliberation), and societal (governance) scales, we describe how cognitive infrastructures reshape human cognition, public reasoning, and social epistemologies. CIS also provides methodological innovations for studying invisible algorithmic influence: “infrastructure breakdown methodologies”, experimental approaches that reveal cognitive dependencies by systematically withdrawing AI preprocessing after periods of habituation.",

          "abstract": "Truly understanding the position of ideological opponents is challenging, yet crucial if our goals are to avoid escalation or further polarisation, identify areas of agreement, and ultimately reduce misunderstanding. We operationalise the idea of an ‘Ideological Turing Test’, as a behavioural measure of the extent to which people are able to accurately represent the position of their ideological opponents. The original ‘Turing Test’ challenged any artificial intelligence to successfully mimic human dialogue- the test would be passed if a human was convinced that the machine was a human. The Ideological Turing Test has been proposed (Caplan 2011 Econlib) as a requirement for would-be human debaters - can they successfully mimic their ideological opponent’s arguments to the extent that their opponent endorses the argument as strongly as their own? Crucially, this ‘Test’ offers a behavioural measure of open mindedness which goes beyond self-report measures. It is not possible to pass an Ideological Turing Test by believing you understand the other’s perspective - you must articulate those arguments to the satisfaction of those who hold them.  In this study, we operationalise the Ideological Turing Test by recruiting participants from opposite sides of commonly polarising debates (Covid-19 Vaccines, Brexit, Veganism), and asking them to provide reasons both for and against their position. These reasons were rated by participants from the opposite side of the debate. Our criteria for “passing” the Ideological Turing Test is if an argument is agreed with by opponents to the same extent or higher than arguments made by proponents. We found no difference in minority or majority positions in their ability to pass the Ideological Turing Test (i.e. no difference in passing rate between those who are for or against Covid-19 vaccines). However we did find that those who pass the Ideological Turing Test are less judgemental towards their opponents, in that they are less likely to rate them as ignorant, immoral or irrational. The Ideological Turing Test not only provides a  behavioural measure of open-mindedness, it also provides insights into the scope and diversity of arguments within and between polarising topics.",

          "abstract": "Although item memory (e.g., remembering seeing your sunglasses) and source memory (e.g., remembering seeing them on the top shelf) have been dissociated both behaviorally and neurologically, little is known about dissociations in their forgetting patterns. A neuropsychological theory of forgetting (Hardt et al., 2013) predicts dissociated forgetting patterns depending on whether a memory is represented in the hippocampus or not. Extra-hippocampally represented memories, such as item memory, should be particularly susceptible to short-term, primarily interference-based forgetting. Hippocampus-dependent source memory should be protected from short-term forgetting but prone to long-term, primarily decay-based forgetting. We tested these predictions in three experiments (Ns = 164 to 210) in which participants studied object pictures in different screen locations. Item (object) and source (location) memory were tested at different retention intervals manipulated between subjects: immediately, after a short period (~10 min) of (similar or dissimilar) mental activity or intended low activity (audio-guided breathing exercise; wakeful rest), or on the next day. Across all experiments, there was no forgetting in source memory over any of the short retention intervals, whereas item memory significantly declined across most of them. There was substantial forgetting over 24 hours in both item and source memory, with more long-term forgetting in source memory after accounting for the short-term forgetting in item memory. Thus, forgetting patterns are dissociated between item versus source memory, in line with the predictions by Hardt et al. Some questions remain regarding the role of similarity-based interference in the observed short-term forgetting in visual item recognition.",

Differential accuracy has been shown due to race, age and gender, raising important questions about the impact of facial recognition decisions on the fairness of society. Current methods for measuring bias require curating large databases of face images, which is labor-intensive, producing bespoke tests that cannot be easily shared or standardized due to data privacy. Here we develop a novel solution to this problem inspired by psychological research in face perception. We ask whether face averages can be used to predict face recognition accuracy differentials for DNNs and humans. We generate sets of average images from random samples of exemplar faces from a demographic group to measure the density of these sets in representational space. We find that this approach provides reliable predictions of differential accuracy across demographic groups in both DNNs and human participants. However, we also find evidence that face averages were not represented in the center of face categories. This finding should be addressed in future development of our approach, and also challenges influential cognitive models of face identity representation.",

          "abstract": "The question of which words are the most central or important to a language has been explored in various ways. In this study, we propose definitions of core vocabulary that are based on how language is learned, represented, and processed from psychological perspectives, and test these on a word prediction task. We aim to (1) compare core vocabulary based on word frequency in natural language, the content of word associations,\nand age-of-acquisition in terms of how well they are guessed in word prediction contexts, and (2) investigate the extent to which word prediction in language models aligns with humans, and if there are systematic differences between them, whether these can be captured by core vocabulary measures. Across two experiments, 867 participants completed a task which involved guessing target words that were missing from sentence contexts. Natural language-based core words were generally easier to guess, but when the degree to which these words were naturally predictable in the linguistic environment was taken into account, word association- and acquisition-based core words were easier to predict for reasons that went beyond this. Additionally, language models were able to account for people’s word prediction responses to a considerable extent, but there were also systematic deviations from these predictions which were able to be captured by word association-based coreness. The findings suggest that distributional relationships between words in text is not all there is to human word prediction, but that people may also rely on factors like communicative usefulness and multimodal or extralinguistic information.",

The Identity Vitality-Pathology (IVP) model posits that modifiable identity-related characteristics shape depression risk, with a vitalized identity—marked by an inclusive self-concept, intrinsic valuing of living beings, and universal compassion—protective against depression. This study examined the association between identity state and depression across Black and White women and men.\nMethods: Data came from 2,008 Black and White adults aged 35–65 in the 2025 Healthy Aging with Resilient Identities study. Stratified ordinal logistic regression models generated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for race-gender–specific predictors of depression.\nResults: Severe depression prevalence was highest among White men (9.3%), followed by White women (6.0%), Black women (3.8%), and Black men (3.2%). Higher IVP Scale (IVPS) scores—indicating greater identity vitality—were associated with lower odds of worse depression in all groups except White men. Compared to those with the lowest (Q1) IVPS scores, those in the highest (Q4) had 70% lower odds among Black women (aOR=0.3, 95% CI: 0.1, 0.6) and Black men (aOR=0.3, 95% CI: 0.1, 0.8), and 90% lower odds among White women (aOR=0.1, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.3), but little difference among White men (aOR=0.9, 95% CI: 0.5, 1.5).\nConclusions: Findings suggest vitalized identity may reduce depression risk but also highlight the need for interventions attuned to the distinct racialized and gendered contexts shaping health.",

This quantitative cross-sectional study was an examination in to the effects of ACEs on adult morality and proposed affective personality traits and caregiving factors as possible mediating mechanisms. The researcher administered a comprehensive online survey to a global sample of N = 376 English-speaking adults, comprised of four validated survey measures that assessed both retrospective and present experiences, traits, and character styles. The survey assessed ACE exposure (10-item ACE-Q), species-typical caregiving practices (EDNH), the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales (ANPS), and the 20-item Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ-20), an assessment of moral intuitions derived from Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). The researcher designed the study to test the trauma/Thriving-Emotions-Morality (tTEM) framework, which posits that emotions are primary in moral beliefs and are cultivated through childhood relationships. Results from group comparisons between high-ACE (≥4) and low-ACE (≤ 3) participants indicated small but significant differences, with high-ACE participants tending toward higher Individualizing and lower Binding moral foundations scores compared to low-ACE participants. Structural equation modeling (SEM) indicated a mediated link between ACEs and MFT, where positive personality traits and heightened EDNH scores positively predicted both Binding and Individualizing moral foundations. These results suggest that early nurturance promotes positive emotional development, shaping moral proclivities. Such research is instructive for clinicians, educators, and policymakers alike, informing existing practices and promoting the future development of enrichment programs that support positive childhood experiences and later moral development.",

In this review of a wide-ranging body of literature, we identify three features of characters and stories that contribute to the likelihood that character identification will occur: narrative transportation, the character’s availability to the audience, and self-character similarity. We conclude that self-relevance is the underlying aspect of self-character interaction that can lead to self-concept change via identification. Further, we demonstrate that the features of fictional characters that contribute to identification are the same as or similar to psychological phenomena that influence identification and changes in self-concept in non-fictional contexts (i.e., with “real” people). Because connections with fiction provoke mental processes similar or identical to processes experienced in real life but expand the perspectives from which these processes are approached, we posit that identifying with imaginary people is an ideal opportunity for real self-change.",

While digital supports can reach underserved groups, uptake is limited when tools are not co-produced with youth. The research aimed to identify mental health challenges and needs, explore currently used digital resources, and generate policy and practice recommendations.\nMaterials and Methods\nUsing the Design Council’s co-production framework, creative workshops and interviews-involving photo-elicitation methods- were conducted. Young people aged 16–25 from marginalised backgrounds shared their experiences with mental health, their needs, and perspectives on digital resources. Visual content was either curated by the team through youth input or created by participants themselves to prompt discussion. Narratives accompanying these visuals formed the primary data and were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.\nResults\nDigital tools and platforms were viewed as both supportive and potentially undermining mental health. Benefits included supporting positive mental health, moderated peer support, and advocacy opportunities; risks involved privacy concerns, misinformation, and the impersonal nature of AI. Participants highlighted the need for culturally sensitive, youth-driven, and equity-focused interventions that link online resources to offline care, address systemic social and economic barriers, and foster safe, inclusive communities.\nDiscussion\nTechnology can meaningfully support marginalised young people’s mental health when co-designed with diverse youth and embedded within an equity-oriented system. Policy and practice recommendations include embedding inclusive co-production; developing culturally competent, gender-responsive, and intersectional resources; integrating digital supports with offline services; enhancing digital safeguarding; strengthening peer and community-based platforms; and using technology to enable meaningful youth participation in policymaking. Scalable, rights-based digital supports—aligned with national strategies in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland—can help build a more responsive, equitable mental health system.",

          "abstract": "According to predictive processing models, hallucinations can arise from over-weighting of prior expectations relative to sensory input. Individuals who hallucinate may misattribute internally-generated experiences to external sources. Combining these mechanisms, we hypothesised that hallucination-proneness in a non-clinical sample is associated with a greater reliance on internally-generated priors compared to externally-provided priors during degraded speech perception.\n\nTwo online experiments were conducted with healthy adult participants. Experiment 1 (N=92) targeted lower-level perceptual processes by assessing sensitivity and bias in distinguishing regular vocoded speech from unintelligible, spectrally-rotated vocoded stimuli at varying levels of sensory clarity. Experiment 2 (N=100) compared the influence of internally-generated versus externally-provided priors on perception of vocoded speech content. Internal- and external-priors were matched in reliability to test if hallucination-proneness was linked to differential influences of internally-generated priors on speech perception.\n\nExperiment 1 confirmed that participants who are more hallucination-prone showed a reduced ability to distinguish potentially intelligible speech from unintelligible speech, and a higher bias toward indicating that speech was present in unintelligible stimuli. Experiment 2 confirmed differential effects of internal priors, showing that hallucination-proneness scores were linked to a greater influence on internally-generated priors on perceptual report when these were incorrect, and a lower reliance on externally-provided priors when these were correct.\n\nThese findings suggest that hallucination-proneness is linked to an increased influence of internally-generated compared to externally-provided predictions on perception. This may contribute to the misattribution of self-generated content as external, suggesting an additional element of predictive processing theories of hallucinations.",

While the extent of this work reflects a newfound interest in the study of aperiodic activity, the study of aperiodic activity itself is not new. There is a rich, though arguably fractured and underappreciated, history of work developing and demonstrating key findings and ideas regarding aperiodic neural activity, dating back many decades. In addition, studies of behavior, physiology, and physics have contributed many ideas, methods, and theoretical frameworks that have informed the study of neural activity. This perspective explores the history of the study of aperiodic neural activity and related topics, covering early discussions of separating oscillatory and aperiodic activity that started in the late 1940s, the emergence of frequency-domain measures of non-frequency specific activity by the mid 1970s, and findings from across the subsequent half-century of work investigating how aperiodic neural activity relates to development, cognition, disease, and more. Collectively, this history set the foundation for key ideas regarding aperiodic activity prior to the recent (re-)emergence of these topics in contemporary work. In summarizing this historical study of aperiodic neural activity, this perspective seeks both to establish the historical context of such work as well as to emphasize the wealth of knowledge available in the historical record to contextualize and contribute to current and future work.",

          "abstract": "Psychologists often measure morality in dollars and cents. Economic games and\ncharitable giving tasks frame giving money to strangers as moral and keeping money as\nselfish. This ‘pay-to-play’ paradigm has grown popular with the rise in online experiments.\nHere, we present data that trouble the interpretation of this paradigm in online settings. We\ninvited US crowdworkers (N=1384) to make charitable decisions and measured not just\ntheir choices, but the motives and meanings they ascribed to those choices. We found that\ncrowdworkers’ most common motive for keeping money was acute financial need (e.g.,\nstruggling to pay for medical care or groceries), and they did not interpret their decisions to\nkeep money as selfish. Third-party judges (N=140) agreed that keeping money in economic\ntasks out of financial need was not selfish, and considered such tasks to be an\nunreasonable measure of altruism and selfishness. Further, third-parties believed it would\nbe unpleasant for crowdworkers to be solicited to donate. Finally, we found that\ncrowdworkers reporting financial need were unresponsive to standard interventions\ndesigned to boost generosity. Overall, these findings challenge the assumption that keeping\nmoney uniformly reflects selfishness, and raise ethical and practical considerations about\nhow experimenters should define and measure morality.",

          "abstract": "The active systems consolidation hypothesis (Inostroza &amp; Born, 2013; Klinzing et al., 2019) predicts that sleep compared to wakefulness benefits context binding in episodic memory for retention intervals of up to 12 hr. Extending previous research on sleep benefits in item-context associative memory, we investigated whether sleep also improves memory for context-context associations. In an online source-monitoring experiment, we used intentionally learned pictures as items and incidentally learned horizontal and vertical screen positions as context dimensions to compare context binding in source memory for retention intervals filled with natural night sleep versus daytime wakefulness. In line with the active systems consolidation hypothesis, multinomial modeling analyses revealed a significant sleep benefit in bound source memory for horizontal and vertical spatial locations of items. Hence, not only memory for item-context associations but also memory for context-attribute bindings benefits from sleep.",

          "abstract": "Despite the exponential growth of digital platforms, a paradox persists: while audiences frequently consume online content, only a fraction actively subscribe or follow creators. This study investigates the psychological and behavioral reasons behind non-subscription behavior among social media users. Using a survey-based approach (N = 21), the research explores demographic patterns, daily digital engagement, and self-reported motivations for not subscribing. Findings reveal that while most respondents engage heavily with digital media (5–8 hours per day on average), they rarely commit to subscribing. Key deterrents include forgetting to subscribe, aversion to notifications, and perceiving little added value in following. These results highlight the \"passive consumer\" phenomenon, wherein audiences prefer low-friction access to content. Implications suggest that creators must reduce barriers to subscription and emphasize tangible benefits. Limitations of this exploratory study include its small sample size and reliance on self-reporting. Nevertheless, the study provides valuable insights into online engagement behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Rates of youth mental disorders vary across white, Black and Hispanic youths in the United States. The weak evidence for the generalizability of diagnostic tools significantly challenge the understanding of racial and ethnic differences in mental disorder risks. The Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS) is a widely used diagnostic interview. However, its applicability across racial and ethnic groups is questionable. The current study tested the statistical generalizability, or measurement equivalence, of the K-SADS across Hispanic (n=2,015), non-Hispanic white (n=6,021) and non-Hispanic Black (n=1,420) youths, using data from the Adolescent and Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. The sample was diverse in terms of child’s sex assigned at birth. Our results indicated that the K-SADS screening interview had a one-factor structure that was scalar equivalent. However, nearly 50% of its items functioned differently across groups, suggesting unequal probabilities of symptom endorsement at equivalent levels of mental disorder risks. Crucially, socioeconomic factors explained many of the measurement differences across groups, implicating their role in the validity of symptom reporting. Findings from this study can help develop clinical screening tools that are generalizable across race, ethnicity and socioeconomic factors, which is important for a contextualized understanding of racial and ethnic differences in youth mental disorders.",

          "abstract": "This narrative review examines the evolving role of representations—neural, mental and computational constructs that mediate perception, reasoning, and behavior—across the intertwined histories of cybernetics, cognitive sciences, and artificial intelligence. We begin by revisiting the rise and decline of cybernetics and its influence on the cognitive revolution, foregrounding how early debates over internal representations continue to shape current approaches. We then explore three frameworks that exemplify how representations function in scientific practice: cognitive maps in neuroscience, schemas in cognitive and clinical psychology, and object relations in psychodynamic theory. These traditions, though methodologically distinct, converge in treating representations as adaptive interfaces tailored to disciplinary goals rather than static mirrors of reality. Drawing on insights from computational psychiatry and neuroAI, we argue that scientific progress depends not on converging toward a single “correct” model of representation, but on developing representations that are flexible, context-sensitive, and reflexively engaged with their own assumptions. We caution against equating engineering performance with theoretical adequacy and highlight how historical cycles of scientific hype, from cybernetics to modern AI, can obscure valuable, if marginalized, contributions. By integrating perspectives across psychology, neuroscience, and AI, this review offers conceptual tools to support transdisciplinary dialogue and encourages researchers not to treat representation as a fixed ontology, but rather as a problem space requiring ongoing negotiation and pluralistic experimentation.",

          "abstract": "Characterizing psychological processes as dynamical systems has become a common practice in psychology. Most often, psychological theories are expressed in verbal terms and then interpreted by researchers in their operationalization. In contrast, theories can also be expressed formally in mathematical or computational terms. However, translating verbal theories of dynamical systems into formal theories, especially those represented by differential equations (DEs), often requires knowledge of physics and mathematics beyond the standard training received by psychologists. In this article, we seek to provide a roadmap for researchers who wish to build a formal theory expressed in DEs from a verbal theory. We use a running example to illustrate the various steps and end with a discussion on caveats of formalizing using DE models. Our roadmap aims at the phase of formal theory development and refinement, before a researcher collects their data. We discuss different DE applications and provide corresponding examples for researchers interested in further reading.",

Studies 2a (N = 1,506) and 2b (N = 1,255), conducted as one-week longitudinal studies during the 2024 European and French parliamentary elections, revealed that an information treatment emphasizing deservingness cues strongly reduced misperceptions about immigrants, modestly reduced opposition to immigration, and had an even smaller effect for anti-immigration voting. These findings suggest that while immigrants are often perceived negatively, emphasizing perceived deservingness can mitigate prejudice, presenting a promising strategy for reducing anti-immigration bias.",

          "abstract": "Activists are mobilizing worldwide to address the climate crisis. In the past years, climate movements have attracted many newcomers. Yet, even among motivated individuals who contacted a movement, becoming an actively engaged member remains rare. Previous studies have focused on non-engaged people’s intentions and barriers to joining or have surveyed long-term activists, yet little is known about newcomers. We studied how newcomers join different climate movements. In co-creation with activist organizers, we aimed to identify the phases of joining a climate movement and what facilitates and hinders engagement. We interviewed 23 individuals who had joined Extinction Rebellion (XR) United Kingdom, XR Netherlands, or the International Climate Students Movement. Five months later, the interviewees completed a short follow-up survey. Using inductive thematic analysis, we identified three phases associated with specific facilitators and barriers. The first phase was often initiated based on previous experience and a strong motivation to make a change. The second phase was marked by becoming active and socially integrated. In the final phase, activists transitioned from newcomers to active members. In the medium term, feeling effective and positive within the movement was associated with sustained engagement. Based on these findings, we recommend tailoring support for interested potential activists, newcomers, and experienced activists. Providing clear information, dedicated integrator roles, and emotional check-ins can help build broad, welcoming, and persistent activist movements. We suggest future longitudinal research starting from the moment of entry, as well as quasi-experiments testing socialization tactics.",

          "abstract": "Real-time sentence comprehension relies on memory resources to establish long-distance syntactic dependencies. There is convincing evidence that formation of many dependencies is mediated by hierarchical constraints. However, it remains an open question how richly hierarchical information is represented and employed in memory processes. Here we ask whether hierarchical relations between noun phrases in a sentence as in x c-commands y (Reinhart, 1976) constrain antecedent retrieval for a local anaphor. We measure the real-time reactivation of c-commanding target antecedents and distractors in processing the Turkish reciprocal birbirleri via three visual world studies. Unlike existing studies that confounded multiple cues, we disentangled c-command from other structural information (clause-mateness, case, subjecthood) and linear order/recency. Experiment 1 compared the availability of c-commanding subjects and non-c-commanding, clause-mate, similarly case-marked distractors; and showed that c-commanding subjects were rapidly distinguished from distractors within the reciprocal window, irrespective of their linear order. Experiment 2 revealed that immediate availability of c-commanding subjects extends to c-commanding indirect objects. Experiment 3 was a pre-registered, high-power replication that yielded similar results. We found limited evidence for interference from distractors, which was not replicated. Overall, we find that hierarchical, item-to-item relations between noun phrases rapidly determine antecedent availability in retrieval beyond other cues. We suggest that hierarchical information may guide access to c-commanding items during retrieval if item representations include hierarchically informed features targeted by retrieval cues; alternatively, hierarchical information may shape the organization of items in memory, with c-commanding items represented in a privileged store allowing direct access during retrieval.",

          "abstract": "Well-being is a central focus of psychological science, yet most evidence comes from WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) populations, limiting the generalizability of findings. Using the UK subsample (N = 5,221 across 42 regions) of two waves of the Global Flourishing Study (GFS), a large, culturally diverse longitudinal dataset, this study examined the stability of well-being (happiness, life satisfaction, and life worth), the moderating role of demographic characteristics (age, gender, marital status, income), and the contribution of regional context. Multilevel models with random intercepts for regions were used to account for geographic nesting. Across outcomes, well-being was highly stable over one year, with baseline scores explaining most of the variance, leaving limited room for moderation. Consequently, moderation effects of demographic variables were generally small. Significant interactions emerged in some cases, indicating subtle differential trajectories and consistent with expectations that these structural influences unfold gradually over longer periods. Regional variance was minimal, suggesting that most variation occurs within individuals rather than across regions. Sensitivity analyses and robustness checks confirm these findings. These findings illuminate the robustness of short-term well-being measures and highlight the challenges of detecting moderation over brief intervals. Importantly, the study demonstrates the value of large-scale, culturally diverse longitudinal data and we provide lessons learned and a few statistical addendum for those working with data such as the GFS.",

          "abstract": "Scientific communication faces a dual crisis: exponential publication growth overwhelms human readers while fragmented research practices prevent automated knowledge synthesis. This crisis is exacerbated by AI-assisted writing—producing papers faster than they can be consumed. Behavioral and social sciences, in particular, suffer from incomparable stimulus databases, jingle–jangle measurement fallacies, and demographic blindness that conceals effect heterogeneity. While AI tools support comprehension and summary assistance, they cannot aggregate findings from incommensurable studies and risk amplifying biases when trained on unstructured, unverified text. We propose restructuring scientific papers for dual audiences: front-loaded narratives for time-pressed human readers, paired with machine-readable appendices containing executable code, standardized metadata, and ontologically-mapped constructs. This transforms papers into queryable research environments where readers can directly interrogate data and rerun analyses. Structured appendices enable automated verification of statistical methods and AI-assisted peer review grounded in executable rather than narrative claims. These restructured papers become nodes in continuously updating evidence networks. Each publication automatically contributes effect sizes to real-time meta-analyses, with corrections and retractions propagating instantly through dependent analyses. Widespread adoption requires institutional recognition of structured documentation as essential scholarly output and computational infrastructure that serves both human comprehension and machine analysis.",

For example, droughts become more frequent and intense. Thus, the question arises, whether visible signs of climate change diminishes nature’s beneficial effects on humans. In an experimental online study, German participants (N = 239) experienced an audio-guided imagined walk either through intact nature, nature affected by a drought, or an indoor control condition. Results showed that the imagined walk through intact nature was more restorative than through the control environment. Most importantly, the walk through drought-affected nature led to less positive effects compared to intact nature—and was similar to the control condition. Signs of drought even led to higher negative affect compared to the control condition. However, neither current connectedness to nature nor predictors of climate action (i.e., environmental concern and pro-environmental behavioural intentions) were different between the experiences in intact and drought-affected nature. Overall, our study suggests that signs of drought diminish beneficial well-being effects of nature experiences, but do not affect actions leading to climate change mitigation.",

          "authors": "Joscha Dutli; Klaus Oberauer; Lea Maria Bartsch",
          "abstract": "The semantic elaboration effect refers to the finding that semantic processing of words leads to better memory performance when the words are semantically congruent with the orienting questions with which they are studied. In Experiment 1, we were unable to replicate the congruency effect that motivated the concept of elaboration. We ran 8 follow-up experiments (Exp. S1–S8) that partially resolved our failed replication attempt: We found robust congruency effects in recognition tests, but not in free recall. This result can be explained by the hypothesis that elaboration improves memory by establishing effective retrieval cues, and elaboration is effective only inasmuch as these retrieval cues are available at test. To investigate the retrieval-cue hypothesis further, we asked whether participants are able to freely recall the orienting questions as retrieval cues. Recall of these questions was poor, providing a potential explanation for absent congruency effects in free recall. We formalized the retrieval-cue hypothesis in a simple computational model, applied it to Experiments 1 and S1–S8, and found that the model can account for the congruency effects we observed. In Experiment 3, we directly tested the models’ prediction that the size of the congruency effect is determined by the probability of recalling the orienting questions as cues by letting one group of participants learn the orienting questions before the experiment. We found a larger congruency effect in this group compared to a control group that did not learn the orienting questions, further supporting the retrieval-cue hypothesis of elaboration.",

Many cases go undetected due to a lack of contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it: predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage, remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end, we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a meaningful addition to traditional methods.",

          "abstract": "While psychological science suffers from measurement proliferation and fragmentation (Anvari et al., 2025), some measures prosper: With over 3,000 citations since its publication approximately 20 years ago, the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART; Lejuez et al., 2002) has become one of the most widely used measurement instruments of the behavioral and clinical sciences. Yet, despite its widespread adoption still little is known regarding the task’s psychometric properties in terms of meta-analytic evidence—which may be related to researcher degrees of freedom and flexibility during task implementation that hinder cumulative scientific progress. We thus conducted a robust Bayesian meta-analysis synthesizing 1,667 effect sizes from 220 studies comprising the data of 51,932 participants, to (i) take stock of the psychometric properties of the BART and (ii) quantify measurement flexibility and its impact on the task’s psychometric properties. Although the BART showed satisfactory levels of test–retest reliability (r = 0.54), there was low to no known–groups validity (d = 0.10), convergent validity with other risk-taking measures (r = 0.00), and external validity (r = 0.02). The task’s convergent validity with measures of impulsivity and sensation seeking (r = 0.07) and its divergent validity with measures of cognitive ability (r = 0.12) were also low. There was substantial variability in study characteristics that had an impact on the estimates of all psychometric properties. We make recommendations for future research on the BART and its use, and how psychological science more generally may profit from adopting similar approaches to become a more integrative and cumulative field.",

To address this gap, we present the Structural Re-cursive Model (SRM), a unified framework f or representing, measuring, and navigating the dynamics of identity. SRM reconceive “perfection” not as a static state, but as the capacity for context-sensitive alignment under change. Our contribution is fourfold: (i) a structured state space (domains × stakeholders) with a symbolic G-scale; (ii) a formal model of structural satisfaction, happiness, and resilience; (iii) a temporal, volumetric extension to capture long-term evolution; and (iv) a concrete architecture for AI self-modeling, enabling artificial agents to maintain their own SRM for transparent, value-aligned interaction. Ultimately, SRM provides a computational grammar for the self-a language structured enough for machine implementation, yet expressive enough for lived experience, paving the way for a new symbiosis between human and artificial cognition.",

          "abstract": "Uncontrollable situations are often experienced as more challenging than those within our control. Recently, it has been proposed that threat (un)controllability also affects fear learning processes. Most studies compare two variants of threat control – lacking versus having control. However, losing control might cause more distress than lacking control and be clinically relevant. The current study investigated the impact of loss of control over threat on conditioned fear. We randomly assigned 80 participants to a Continuous Control (CC) or a Loss of Control (LC) group and administered a threat (un)controllability task integrated into a fear conditioning procedure. Participants were presented with two pictures, one of which was consistently paired with an electrical stimulus (US). Participants from the CC group could learn to terminate the US with a mouse click. Participants in the LC group could terminate the stimulus initially but then lost this possibility. During the extinction and renewal phases, the pictures were repeatedly presented without the US. A new background context was introduced in the renewal phase. US-expectancy ratings, skin-conductance responses, fear ratings, and control predictions were collected throughout the procedure. The LC group displayed higher cue-elicited fear and lower expected control than the CC group. A similar pattern persisted during the extinction and renewal phases (increased skin conductance responses and reduced expected control). A general sense of control and anhedonia partially moderated the relationship between threat (un)controllability and fear renewal. These findings present initial evidence for the impact of losing control over threat on fear formation and reduction.",

          "abstract": "Body representations arise from the integration of multiple sensory signals that provide information about the body’s size, posture, and internal states. Vision often plays a dominant role, calibrating and aligning signals from touch, proprioception, and interoception. Yet, individuals born without sight still construct coherent and functional body representations, suggesting that the role of vision in building these representations may be more flexible than previously thought. Here, we synthesize recent behavioral and neuroimaging findings on body representations in blind individuals. We argue that blindness offers a powerful case study in how body representations can emerge through non-visual pathways, revealing the brain’s capacity to flexibly reorganize the sensory inputs supporting its internal models of the body. In doing so, we highlight the broader relevance of visual loss for understanding the plastic and multisensory nature of body representation.",

          "abstract": "Emotion differentiation — the ability to precisely label emotions — reflects a nuanced understanding of one’s emotional experiences. Researchers posit this nuance may be associated with knowing how one can use their emotions. As a result, we hypothesize emotion differentiation may be linked with holding instrumental emotion regulation motives, which involve regulating emotions to attain their benefits beyond solely feeling better or worse. In this research, we tested whether trait emotion differentiation was associated with instrumental emotion regulation motives in daily life, (1) in general and (2) at times when people felt strong emotion. To test these links, we used two experience sampling datasets collected in 2020 in Australia (Study 1, N=173; 50.3% White), and in 2016 in Belgium (Study 2, N=104; 100% European). Contrary to our hypotheses, there was no direct association between trait emotion differentiation and instrumental motive use. However, as hypothesized, in both studies, trait emotion differentiation moderated the relationship between emotion intensity and instrumental motives, though only in the case of negative — not positive — emotion. This interaction was such that those higher in trait emotion differentiation endorsed fewer instrumental motives when emotion was less intense, but more instrumental motives when emotion was more intense. This pattern suggests that people high in trait emotion differentiation may endorse instrumental motives flexibly, by regulating their emotions instrumentally when they are more intense, but not when they are less intense. Our findings support the idea that trait negative emotion differentiation may help individuals channel their intense emotions in useful ways.",

In our study (N = 783), we examined whether people with higher feelings of anxiety and lack of control early in the COVID-19 pandemic endorse more conspiracy theories. Our results show that a higher perception of risk of COVID-19 and lower trust in institutions' response to the pandemic were related to feelings of anxiety and lack of control. Feeling the lack of control, but not anxiety, independently predicted COVID-19 conspiracy theory endorsement. Importantly, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs were strongly correlated with generic conspiracy and pseudoscientific beliefs, which were likewise associated with the feeling of lack of control and lower trust in institutions. The results highlight that considering people's emotional responses to the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial for our understanding of the spread of conspiracy and pseudoscientific beliefs.",

This study investigates the generation of false memories leveraging different data-driven computational models to independently quantify language-based and vision-based experiential knowledge, as extracted from large-scale databases consisting of 639 billion words and 15 million images, respectively. We then tested the effects of these knowledge sources in two false-memory experiments, one employing images and the other words as stimuli. Our findings unveil both modality-independent and modality-dependent processes in the formation of memory traces. Indeed, we observed a contribution of both prior visual and linguistic knowledge regardless of the types of stimuli to be memorised. However, the extent of this contribution differed as a function of the modality tested: visual prior knowledge is more influential in image-based tasks, while linguistic prior knowledge dominates in word-based tasks. This dual and modality-dependent contribution underscores the adaptive nature of memory processes, revealing the dynamic integration of diverse experiential traces in false memory formation.",

In two studies, I constructed and tested a novel questionnaire on epistemically suspect beliefs (Study 1, N = 263), and used it to examine probabilistic reasoning biases and belief bias in syllogistic reasoning as predictors of the endorsement of those beliefs, while accounting for analytic thinking and worldview variables (Study 2, N = 397). Probabilistic reasoning biases, analytic thinking, religious faith, and political liberalism consistently predicted various epistemically suspect beliefs, whereas the effect of syllogistic belief bias was largely restricted to pseudoscientific beliefs. Further research will be needed to examine the role the biased evaluation of evidence plays in the endorsement of epistemically suspect beliefs.",

In Study 1, both AI-driven and textual climate communication formats increased pro-environmental and adaptation intentions from pre- to post-intervention. Importantly, the effectiveness of the different communication formats depended on audience characteristics: the textual communication was more effective for highly climate-curious participants, while the AI-driven communication was more effective for those with low curiosity. Study 2 further showed that AI-driven climate communication was perceived as more engaging than a comprehensive textual scientific climate report. This was particularly pronounced for participants with low climate change curiosity and threat beliefs. We conclude that more experiential communication formats like AI-driven climate communication may help engage and impact previously unengaged audiences.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated whether the Work Ability Index can predict return to work for individuals (N=213) with a compensable personal injury. A binomial logistic regression analysis found that the overall Work Ability Index score explained a significant portion of the variance in return-to-work outcomes (McFadden’s R2 = 0.516). A comparison of the median Work Ability Index scores for the working and non-working groups revealed a clear distinction: the median score was 27 for those who returned to work (on the border of poor and moderate work ability) and 12 for those who did not (clearly classified as poor work ability). The Work Ability Index showed predictive ability, as evidenced by an AUC of 0.94. Furthermore, an analysis of the 10 questions on the Work Ability Index showed significant differences between the two groups on all but one question. The best predictor was the individual's estimated work ability in two years' time (rank biserial = 0.851), while the number of current diseases or injuries was the worst predictor (rank biserial = 0.133). It was concluded that the Work Ability Index is a useful and effective tool for predicting return to work after a compensable injury",

However,\nin contrast to earlier studies and reviews, a Cochrane network meta-analysis from 2021 concluded\nthat the estimated efficacy of fluoxetine was no longer clinically meaningful.\nStudy aim: To explain the discrepant findings between the recent Cochrane review and earlier\nreviews and to explore if this was acknowledged in guidelines and treatment recommendations\nappearing since then.\nMethods: Meta-analytical aggregation of trial results over time, exploring potential biases, and a\nnon-systematic search for recent treatment guidelines/recommendations from major medical\norganizations.\nResults: The estimated efficacy of fluoxetine in clinical trials declined over time into the range of\nclinical equivalence with placebo when more recent studies were included in analyses and when\nconsidering common thresholds of clinical significance. This remains unacknowledged in treatment\nguidelines and related publications, including some that continue to recommend fluoxetine as first-\nline pharmacological treatment. Finally, we find that the loss of efficacy over time is likely\nexplained by biases such as the novelty bias or by variations of expectancy effects.\nConclusions: The seeming lack of clinically meaningful efficacy of fluoxetine for the treatment of\npediatric depression needs to be considered by those who develop treatment recommendations as\nwell as by patients and clinicians.

          "abstract": "Reported perception can exhibit a repulsive bias away from a task-irrelevant prior stimulus. Previous research has suggested that this repulsive serial bias is driven by low-level adaptation, such that the prior stimulus repels the representation of the new stimulus during encoding. To test this account, the present study compared the repulsive serial bias with another perceptual bias that is known to be driven by an adaptation mechanism (e.g., the tilt aftereffect). We measured the repulsive serial bias using a common location delayed estimation task and the adaptation-driven bias using a location estimation task with an inducer stimulus. We predicted that if the two types of biases were driven by common mechanisms, then they should be positively correlated. However, no such correlation was observed. In addition, we found that only the repulsive serial bias was associated with a response time effect, where responses were slower when the bias was stronger. Moreover, mouse-tracking data for the repulsive serial bias exhibited a pattern that started with a stronger repulsion and ended with smaller repulsion, which cannot be explained solely by an adaptation mechanism. Taken together, our findings suggest that repulsive serial bias in continuous estimation tasks involves post-perceptual decisional processes that are not present in the adaptation-driven bias.",

          "abstract": "Suicide is a leading global cause of death among adolescents and emerging adults, with suicidality encompassing ideation and self-harm, attempts and suicides. Despite its severity, a third of suicidal and self-harming adolescents recover before adulthood, highlighting the importance of identifying recovery factors for effective interventions. This scoping review was aimed to synthesize how recovery from suicidality is defined and experienced by young people aged 6 to 25, and to identify the psychosocial and contextual factors that facilitate or hinder recovery. We conducted a scoping review of 49 qualitative and quantitative studies involving 26,460 participants. Studies were identified in Medline, PsycInfo, SocINDEX, and CINAHL databases. Quality was assessed using CASP and QUIPS tools. We extracted recovery factors and categorized them into thirteen thematic domains, and  social support, coping skills, and personal acceptance were most endorsed. Recovery was described both as symptom remission and as a personal transformative process involving identity development, emotional regulation, and meaning-making. Recovery was shaped by both internal capacities and external support, including therapeutic relationships, peer connections, and access to identity-affirming or culturally responsive care. Youth emphasized the long-term, personal nature of recovery, extending beyond suicidality to include positive mental health, self-worth, and purpose. Recovery from youth suicidality is multidimensional, and shaped by developmental, relational, and sociocultural contexts. Effective prevention and intervention must go beyond risk reduction to foster protective and promotive factors that empower young people. These findings support the need for more holistic, person-centered approaches to youth mental health and suicidality.",

          "abstract": "Whether people can actively suppress unwanted thoughts is highly controversial. Anderson and Green (2001) developed the Think/No-Think (TNT) task and found that suppressing a memory reduces later recall, referred to as the Suppression-Induced Forgetting (SIF) effect. While some studies replicate this effect, others do not. To better understand the factors influencing the SIF effect, we developed two TNT methodological quality checklists (a 12-item essential version and an extensive 25-item version) based on optimal test conditions proposed by Nardo and Anderson (2024). We then assessed whether following these optimal test conditions predicted SIF effects across 100 TNT studies (143 effects) conducted with non-clinical samples. We found that methodological quality significantly predicted SIF effect significance for the 25-item checklist, but not robustly for the 12-item checklist. Methodological quality did not predict the magnitude of the reported SIF effect. Because there remains considerable uncertainty on the optimal TNT test conditions, we recommend authors report their methods, using the checklists provided in this paper. Exploratory analyses further suggested that studies involving original TNT developer reported significant SIF effects more frequently (95%) than studies without developer involvement (68%). This authorship effect remained significant after controlling for higher methodological quality. More independent studies are thus needed to mitigate possible biases.",

          "abstract": "This article develops a semantic-pragmatic analysis methodology for identifying linguistic manipulation strategies in media texts. Through the application of six mechanisms – implicature, presupposition, pragmatic inferences, modality, genericity, and nominalisation (AUSTIN, 1975; CARLSON, 2011; GRICE, 1975; HEUSINGER; MAIENBORN; PORTNER, 2011; SIMONS, 2005; SPERBER; WILSON, 1995; STALNAKER, 1973; VON FINTEL, 2006) — I propose an analytical model that demonstrates how these linguistic resources can be exploited to create interpretive distortions. Although other mechanisms are available, I focus on these six as they are persistent in misinformation contexts. The analysis identifies five main manipulative strategies: (1) suggestion of biased meanings without explicit commitment to truth conditions, (2) naturalisation of controversial content as established fact, (3) obscuring the degree of commitment between epistemic necessity and deontic obligation, (4) promotion of essentialist universalisations, and (5) suppression of information about agents and responsibilities. The linguistic strategies that sustain misinformation are exemplified through a viral 2023 news story about inclusive terminology for transgender patients in healthcare. The case study serves as a paradigmatic example to demonstrate mechanisms commonly employed by misinformation fabricators. The results contribute to the semantics-pragmatics interface by operationalising the distinction between what is said and what is implicated, revealing how context-dependency mechanisms can be instrumentalised for manipulation, offering perspectives on semantic compositionality and pragmatic inferential processes, and contributing to media literacy and the growing field of digital pragmatics.",

Here, we introduce a scalable method using large language models (LLMs) to analyze verbal reports and identify the articulated reasons for choices between monetary lotteries. We show that a validated LLM accurately identifies predefined decision reasons in participants' free-text reports, aligning with their actual choices in over 92\\% of trials. Our analysis reveals that reason usage varies systematically and is driven more by the choice problem's structure than by individual differences. A predictive model based on these problem-specific reason profiles outperforms prospect theory in out-of-sample prediction. This work demonstrates that verbal reports are a rich data source and that LLMs can unlock their potential, challenging foundational invariance assumptions and paving the way for more context-aware models of human decision-making.",

          "abstract": "Recent work has shown that dynamics in reward value is an important driver of the stability-flexibility tradeoff. However, these studies have only examined deterministic reward, while real-world reward is predominantly uncertain and volatile in nature. Therefore, this study aimed to test how reward uncertainty shapes cognitive flexibility. Uncertainty was manipulated by varying the validity of reward cues through stochastic probabilistic reward schedules. Participants performed a voluntary task switching paradigm with performance-contingent monetary reward at two levels. We used linear mixed models in a large (n=616) undergraduate student sample that enabled us to examine individual differences in how gender and personality influence reward-guided task selection. In line with previous work, we observed a reliable effect of reward transition on flexibility, with more flexible task choices when rewards changed from trial-to-trial and more stability when rewards were stable. Critically, this effect decreased linearly with increasing reward uncertainty. Better than expected high reward outcomes were associated with even greater flexibility than expected high outcomes, however, the reverse was not observed for worse than expected outcomes. At higher levels of reward uncertainty, female participants relied more on recent reward outcomes than cues. Overall, males were more influenced by reward transition than females. Perhaps counterintuitively, reward transition effects on flexibility were most apparent in participants with low levels of reward responsiveness. Our findings suggest that reward uncertainty is a key context that tunes the translation of outcomes into future choices.",

Methods: Participants were included from a longitudinal study of college study mental health during the pandemic, and included if they were trauma-exposed (n=612). Results: A path model revealed that COVID impact factors capturing key pandemic-related domains exerted immediate effects on mental health symptoms, but well-being (subjective quality of life) exerted immediate and longer-term effects. PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms influenced one another in the first months of the pandemic, but only PTSD symptoms impacted depression and anxiety one year later. Conclusions: Well-being may be important for mental health symptoms during the first year of the pandemic. PTSD may be an important focus in the prevention of depression and anxiety, among those exposed to trauma.",

          "authors": "Jürgen Kayser",
          "abstract": "Temporal principal components analysis (tPCA) is widely used to identify and quantify event-related potentials (ERPs). Less commonly, it has been applied to single-trial EEG epochs, despite concerns about the low signal-to-noise ratio and uncertainty about how single-trial components compare with those derived from averaged waveforms. Alternatively, averaged principal components (PCs) can be imposed on single trials via back-projection. The present study evaluated the fidelity of single-trial and back-projected single-trial tPCA (covariance-based, unrestricted Varimax rotation) in representing meaningful averaged PCs by systematically comparing factor loadings and factor scores in two existing ERP datasets (72-channel, N=152; 67-channel, N=98), using both surface-referenced (infinity, nose) and reference-free current source density (CSD) transformations. In the 72-channel dataset with four balanced conditions (emotional hemifield paradigm), single-trial PCs closely matched those from averaged data, whereas in the 67-channel dataset with three imbalanced conditions (novelty oddball task), they did not. In contrast, across datasets and transformations, back-projected single-trial PCs consistently reproduced virtually identical averaged PCs. All single-trial tPCA solutions enabled full reconstruction of the original data matrix, confirming the validity of back-projected decomposition, and all single-trial measures showed high or adequate internal consistency. These findings suggest that single-trial tPCA may approximate averaged solutions only when the variance structure is preserved, whereas back-projection provides a robust alternative: it quantifies single-trial epochs based on the variance structure of the averaged data, thereby maintaining component structure, integrity, and interpretability, and enabling confident linkage of trial-level component measures with other trial-level variables.",

          "abstract": "Statistical power remains a central yet confusing concept in psychology. Pek et al. (2024) define power as the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative is true, a view consistent with many textbook accounts. We argue, however, that Cohen (1962, 1988) advanced a broader definition: the probability of obtaining a significant result, without conditioning on a specific alternative effect size. This broader perspective allows power to serve two functions—planning studies with hypothetical effect sizes and evaluating completed studies with plausible effect size estimates. The broader concept is useful to evaluate single studies and to estimate publication bias. We conclude that power analysis of published research is an important tool for the credibility revolution of psychological research.",

          "abstract": "As an alternative to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, transdiagnostic approaches that identify latent dimensions of psychopathology through factor analysis have gained prominence in recent years. A key critique of these approaches, however, is that they are performed at the level of symptoms only. This begs the question: are these dimensions truly more valid predictors of external outcomes than existing alternatives? Are there other ways, that are more data-driven, which can allow us to refine our definitions of clinical phenotypes? We tested this idea empirically, conducting a large-scale meta-scientific comparison of thousands of competing factor solutions that allowed us to determine if the latent structure underlying the covariation of psychiatric symptoms has robust and specific cognitive correlates. In nine independent datasets, comprising N=7565 individuals including patients about to start mental health treatment, healthy individuals, paid and unpaid participants, a broad set of age ranges and cognitive task variants that measured model-based planning and metacognition, we found that factors with the best fit to cognition were those derived from a first-order factor analysis on the maximal number of theoretically informed self-report symptoms available. These factors (‘Compulsivity and Intrusive Thought’ and ‘Anxious-depression’) performed better than thousands of engineered alternatives and performed twice as well as traditional questionnaire total scores. Crucially, this unsupervised approached based on symptom correlation only performed on-par with a partial least squares analysis, a supervised approach to deriving factors based on cognition. These results provide evidence that unsupervised factor analysis of psychiatric symptoms is a viable method for rethinking how we define mental health and illness, affording clear opportunities for enhancing our understanding of specific underlying mechanistic processes.",

          "abstract": "Persuasion is a complex communicative process aiming at influencing others’ beliefs or behaviors. Imbuing everyday communication, persuasion is a crucial skill for children to manage social \ninteractions successfully. While theoretically persuasion has been linked with the mastery of figurative language and with pragmatics more broadly, there is a scarcity of empirical evidence exploring the relationship between persuasion and metaphor skills. Here we tackle this issue in early childhood by examining whether individual differences in metaphor skills are related to those in persuasion. A sample of 167 children (age 4-6 years) was assessed for persuasive abilities alongside metaphor comprehension and production, in addition to vocabulary and working memory skills as control variables. \nResults showed an improvement in persuasive skills at 5 years of age. Across ages, children preferred \nto use positive persuasive strategies (i.e., offering rewards) over negative ones (i.e., punishments), \nwhile psychological strategies relying on mitigation and modeling were rarely used. Regardless of the \ntype of strategy, persuasion correlated positively with vocabulary skills. Interestingly, greater use of \npsychological persuasive strategies was associated with better metaphor production skills (being con\nversely hampered by working memory), while no effect of metaphor comprehension was found. Over\nall, these findings suggest that some aspects of metaphor skills, within the broader set of pragmatic  competencies, might be a driving factor in achieving a high-level persuasive style. Such aspects possibly deal with the functions of metaphors to favor flexible conceptualization and social use of language.",

This systematic review aims to: 1) provide an overview of substance use treatments for mothers of young children (from birth to 5 years old); 2) synthesize findings on maternal substance use and child/maternal mental health outcomes; and 3) identify key treatment components. Database searches in Medline, PsychINFO, PubMED, and PsycARTICLES were conducted on May 7th, 2024. A total of 14, 916 articles were identified following duplicate removal. Articles were screened following PRISMA guidelines. Eight articles (n = 900) met inclusion criteria. Outcomes of interest included maternal substance use, child/maternal mental health, and treatment components. All studies indicated maternal substance use treatments were at least as, or more, effective in improving maternal substance use and child/maternal mental health outcomes compared to controls. Treatment components included: mother/family mental health, basic needs, parenting skills, occupation/education, operant conditioning, crisis management, and medical education. Operant conditioning was the only treatment component which appeared to positively impact maternal substance use outcomes; no other treatment components were associated with outcomes of interest. This review provides preliminary evidence highlighting the benefits of substance use treatments for mothers of young children on substance use and mental health outcomes. Future randomized controlled trials with harmonized outcome measures and qualitative data that identifies treatment needs of mothers with lived experience are crucial to evaluate maternal substance use treatments and improve treatment development.",

This paper offers a structured set of guidelines for reporting statistical analyses in quantitative psychology, emphasizing clarity at both the planning and results stages. Drawing on established recommendations and emerging best practices, we outline key decisions related to hypothesis formulation, sample size justification, preregistration, outlier and missing data handling, statistical model specification, and the interpretation of inferential outcomes. We address considerations across frequentist and Bayesian frameworks and fixed as well as sequential research designs, including guidance on effect size reporting, equivalence testing, and the appropriate treatment of null results. To facilitate implementation of these recommendations, we provide the  Transparent Statistical Reporting in Psychology (TSRP) Checklist that researchers can use to systematically evaluate and improve their statistical reporting practices (https://osf.io/t2zpq/). In addition, we provide a curated list of freely available tools, packages, and functions that researchers can use to implement transparent reporting practices in their own analyses to bridge the gap between theory and practice. To illustrate the practical application of these principles, we provide a side-by-side comparison of insufficient versus best-practice reporting using a hypothetical cognitive psychology study. By adopting transparent reporting standards, researchers can improve the robustness of individual studies and facilitate cumulative scientific progress through more reliable meta-analyses and research syntheses.",

Non-parenthood includes diverse subgroups with distinct motivations and\npsychosocial profiles. One under-researched subgroup is antinatalists, who view procreation as\nmorally wrong. This study examined psychological functioning among antinatalist, childfree,\nand childless individuals.\n\nThis cross-sectional study recruited 492 non-parent adults from the United Kingdom via\nProlific. Participants were categorized into three groups: childless (n=258; desire children or\nare undecided), childfree (n=199; do not desire children for personal/social/economic reasons),\nand antinatalist (n=35; do not desire children for moral/ethical reasons). Participants completed\nthe Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), Child Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ),\nExperiences in Close Relationships–Revised (ECR-R), Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ),\nand Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire–Revised (SBQ-R). Group differences were analyzed\nusing Kruskal-Wallis tests and quantile regression, adjusting for age, education, marital status,\nand ethnicity.\n\nSignificant demographic differences were found between the groups in age, education level,\nmarital status, and ethnicity. Unadjusted analyses showed that childless individuals reported\nsignificantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, stress, attachment anxiety, and search for\nmeaning compared to childfree individuals. After adjusting for demographic covariates, most\nof these group differences became non-significant. However, childfree individuals still showed\nsignificantly lower attachment anxiety (at the median), lower reported childhood physical abuse\n(at the upper quantile), and lower suicidal ideation (at the lower quantile) compared to childless\nindividuals. No evidence emerged that antinatalists experienced greater psychological distress\nthan the other groups.\n\nAfter accounting for demographic factors, psychological differences among antinatalist,\nchildfree, and childless individuals were minimal. Findings suggest that demographic factors,\nrather than reproductive stances alone, largely account for differences observed between non-\nparent groups. This challenges narratives that portray those who choose not to have children,\nparticularly antinatalists, as psychologically maladjusted. However, differences in relative\nrepresentation of these categories may pose a limitation.",

          "authors": "Zhang Qikai; 吴静岚",
          "abstract": "Efficiently perceiving social interactions is fundamental to human social cognition, yet the underlying mechanisms remain contested. Domain-specific theories propose specialized processing for social content, while domain-general accounts attribute perceptual advantages to low-level visual features. This debate has been critically hampered by an overreliance on static stimuli, which obscure crucial temporal dynamics and introduce configural confounds. The present study addressed these limitations using a dynamic visual search paradigm that differentiated physical-contingency interactions (defined by synchronized, perceptually coupled movements) from communicative-contingency interactions (defined by sequential, meaning-based exchanges). Experiment 1 revealed a sharp dissociation: physical-contingency interactions were detected more efficiently than both non-interactive dyads and communicative-contingency interactions, while communicative-contingency interactions showed no search advantages. Experiment 2 employed eye-tracking to elucidate underlying mechanisms. Physical-contingency interaction search showed overall search advantages through enhanced target recognition and efficient distractor rejection, despite equivalent attentional guidance compared to non-interaction search. Communicative-contingency interaction search exhibited enhanced target recognition and efficient distractor rejection but suffered from attentional guidance deficits that eliminated overall search benefits. Additionally, communicative-contingency interactions as distractors required the longest fixation durations, indicating strongest attentional stickiness. These findings challenge existing theoretical frameworks by demonstrating that social interaction search advantages cannot be explained by either domain-specific or domain-general mechanisms alone. We propose a dual-route processing model wherein physical-contingency interactions benefit primarily from domain-general perceptual mechanisms that efficiently process motion synchrony and gestalt properties, while communicative-contingency interactions rely on domain-specific social processing mechanisms that handle complex interpersonal meaning. This integrated framework reconciles competing theoretical perspectives and advances understanding of how different types of social information are prioritized in dynamic visual environments.",

We found no evidence of participants focusing more on poor people’s disadvantages than on rich people’s advantages to signal illegitimacy, even though research suggests that this may be a promising strategy. Instead, participants referenced specific groups (e.g., the poor) more and abstract constructs (e.g., poverty) less to communicate illegitimacy, yet were mostly unaware of doing so. In a follow-up study, participants (N=396) judged statements meant to communicate illegitimacy as actually indicating higher, not lower, legitimacy beliefs.

We specifically investigated overall attentional\ncapacity – that is, the available processing speed – and its distribution, the relative\nattentional weight.\nBy reanalyzing a large existing dataset from Tünnermann and Scharlau (2021),\nwe found that across multiple testing days, participants either remained stable within a\n20 Hz margin or showed consistent improvements in capacity – in some cases tripling\ntheir initial capacity. The weights in response to salient stimuli were remarkably\nconsistent.\nTo determine whether increases in capacity reflect pure test-retest effects or are\nfacilitated by consolidation between days, and to quantify within-day variability, we\nconducted a second study in which participants completed five self-administered\nsessions within a single day. Capacities remained within the same magnitude and did\nnot show a consistent directional trend. The relative weights exhibited comparatively\nlittle variation in most participants, akin to the previously analyzed dataset. Further,\nestimation uncertainty increased with higher capacity values.\nThese results suggest that capacity may be subject to training effects, but that\nsuch improvements appear to depend on longer breaks between sessions. This has\nimportant implications for individualized assessment: A personal prior could be\nestimated from a single session to accelerate future estimations, as long as subsequent\nsessions occur on the same day.

This was the case both during the early phase of stimulus disengagement, as well as during a later maintained attention phase dominated by controlled strategic processes.

          "abstract": "Mental speed is a multidimensional construct that encompasses three distinct time-related measures: reaction time, processing speed, and tempo, the latter of which is defined as the rate at which individuals respond to items varying in difficulty. This study applies van der Linden’s (2007, 2009) hierarchical model to jointly analyze item responses and response times from 1,620 adults taking the nine core subtests of the Reasoning and Intelligence Online Test (RIOT; https://riotiq.com). Using Bayesian estimation of the van der Linden model, results showed strong model fit across subtests, with near-zero correlations between examinee ability and examinee tempo for verbal tasks (r = -.209 to .136) and stronger negative correlations for visuospatial tasks (r = -.467 to -.769), supporting predictions from dual process theory. Item intensity and sensitivity positively moderated response times with difficulty on most subtests, indicating that item characteristics were the cause of longer response times for more difficult items. Few examinees (2.5%) exhibited dual misfit in responses and times, but the Figure Weights subtest revealed anomalous slow responding. These findings demonstrate that tempo (i.e., examinee response times) are independent of cognitive ability level and that correlations between the two are spuriously caused by item characteristics. Implications for intelligence testing and future experimental validation are discussed.",

While experimental paradigms have yielded important insights into auditory processing, their constructs often rely on task-specific definitions that may not fully reflect how sounds are perceived and interpreted outside the laboratory. We argue that auditory evaluation is shaped by the interaction of acoustic properties, affective tone, task demands, and contextual framing. To account for this, we propose a multidimensional framework based on arousal, valence, and context, which enables a more flexible characterization of how sounds are judged in everyday listening. We also examine how different methodological approaches highlight distinct facets of this evaluative process. By focusing on the conditions under which sounds are experienced, this review contributes to a more integrative understanding of auditory attention across both controlled and naturalistic settings.",

          "title": "The Paradox of Agency in Psychotherapy: How People with Mental Distress Experience Generative AI and Human Therapists",
          "authors": "Xiaolu Dai; Ling Li Leng; Yiyan Liu; Yu-Te Huang; Daniel Fu Keung Wong",
          "abstract": "Background: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models has sparked heated debate over whether Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots can serve as “digital therapists” capable of providing therapeutic support. While much of this discussion focuses on AI’s lack of agency, understood as the absence of mental states, consciousness, autonomy, and intentionality, empirical research on users’ real-world experiences remains limited.\nObjective: This study explores how individuals with mental distress engage with both generative AI and human psychotherapy in natural and unguided contexts, with a focus on how perceptions of agency shape these experiences. By drawing on participants’ dual exposure, the study seeks to contribute to the ongoing debate about “AI therapists” by clarifying the role of agency in therapeutic change.\nMethods: Sixteen adults who had sought mental health support from both human therapists and ChatGPT participated in semi-structured interviews, during which they shared and compared their experiences with each type of interaction. Transcripts were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis.\nResults: Analysis revealed three themes and eight subthemes enabling comparison of what participants found helpful and challenging in their interactions with ChatGPT and human therapists: (1) encouraging open and authentic self-disclosure but limiting deep exploration; (2) the myth of relationship: caring, acceptance, and understanding; (3) fostering therapeutic change: the promise and pitfalls of data-driven solutions. Drawing on these comparative reflections, we propose a conceptual model that highlights how perceptions of agency carry both strengths and limitations for therapeutic engagement. The model also illustrates how the non-agential nature of AI chatbots shapes their capacity to support individuals with mental distress in ways that differ from human therapists.\nConclusion: The findings suggest that agency functions as a double-edged feature in therapeutic interactions. Rather than anthropomorphizing AI chatbots, their non-agential features—such as responsive behaviors, absence of intentions, objective stance, and disembodied state—should be used strategically to complement human-delivered psychotherapy. Meanwhile, practitioners should maximize the benefits of their agential qualities while remaining cautious of the potential inherent risks.",

          "abstract": "Emotion regulation (ER) is a dynamic, multi-stage process encompassing the identification, selection, implementation, and monitoring of ER strategies. Empirical studies on ER have increasingly focused on understanding the role of cognitive effort throughout ER processes. Cognitive effort is an essential component of various ER stages: from the identification of the need to regulate emotions, through the selection of ER strategies their implementation, to the monitoring of the regulatory behaviour. The review highlights substantial inter-individual variability in effort expenditure across eR stages and explores the impact of cognitive costs on regulatory outcomes. Findings suggest that high effort demands can increase the likelihood of regulatory failure, perpetuating negative emotional states and impairing well-being. Conversely, automatic ER processes, while less effortful, may limit adaptability to novel emotional challenges. Understanding the intertwined interplay between cognitive effort and ER is important for elucidating crucial components during ER processing and their implications for individual well-being.",

Across four studies of university and online samples (Ntotal=2,391), we used item response theory models and confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) to select the “best” SD4 items. CFAs supported both an eight-facet solution and hierarchical models in which the eight facets loaded onto their four respective Dark Tetrad traits, which in turn loaded onto a global Dark Tetrad factor. We labeled the eight facets as: deviousness, scheming (both assigned to Machiavellianism); leadership, exceptionalism (both assigned to narcissism); defiance, recklessness (both assigned to psychopathy); and violent voyeurism, verbal abuse (both assigned to sadism). We tested the H8’s convergent and discriminant validity with number of sexual partners, self-esteem, Big Five personality, adult attachment, and established measures of the Dark Triad traits.",

          "authors": "Teri Ann Kirby; Seval Gündemir",
          "abstract": "Despite recent attempts to dismantle diversity initiatives in the US, many people and organizations continue to advocate for diversity. However, people vary widely in who they mean when they discuss diversity and their beliefs about why and how to promote diversity. These diversity components have only been examined in separate literatures, lacking full integration. Therefore, diversity scholarship sometimes conflates these different components without acknowledging their conceptual distinctions and historical contexts. We integrate and distinguish the literatures on diversity definitions (who), cases (why), and ideologies (how), while also proposing a new typology for defining diversity that is sensitive to societal hierarchy. Finally, we highlight how these different belief systems about diversity may covertly promote identity-blindness, whereby people state a commitment to diversity despite holding beliefs that undermine it. In particular, we argue that broadened definitions of diversity, the business case for promoting diversity, and value-in-equality diversity ideologies can all covertly help maintain identity-blindness.",

Psyflow, built on top of PsychoPy, provided support for TAPS and offered flexible and modularized tools for participant’s information collection, block/trial management, stimulus presentation, response collection, event synchronization with various neuroimaging systems. TaskBeacon served as the community-driven platform for hosting curated tasks, managing variants, and coordinating community contributions. Finally, the model Context Protocol (MCP) server exposed tools to large language models (LLMs), allowing natural language-driven task development and localization. Together, these components form an ecosystem that advances task standardization, fosters reproducibility and collaboration, and enables LLMs–driven development of cognitive tasks.",

          "abstract": "Recognising subtle signs of positive emotion is essential for trust, cooperation, and social connection. However, everyday barriers—such as face masks—can hinder this ability. We tested whether a brief positive mood induction via comedy viewing could enhance recognition of subtle smiles, and whether this depended on mask-wearing and individual traits. Fifty-three adults (22 males, 31 females) completed a within-subject experiment, watching either a comedy performance or a neutral weather broadcast, then judging the valence of morphed facial expressions (10–30% intensity) shown with or without a mask. Comedy viewing significantly increased positive mood (POMS2-BF VA: p &lt; .001, r = .43) and reduced negative mood (e.g., TA: p = .004, r = .69). Recognition accuracy for subtle positive expressions improved after comedy for unmasked faces (p = .0016, r = .09) but not for masked faces (p = .27), where performance remained at chance. Greater perspective-taking and lower depressive mood predicted greater improvement. Even participants with higher depressive symptoms showed measurable gains. These results demonstrate that a short, enjoyable activity—watching comedy—can sharpen attunement to others’ positive emotions, but only when key facial cues are visible, highlighting both the potential and limits of mood-based interventions for social communication.",

          "abstract": "The present study explored the psychometric properties of the Benign and Malicious Envy Scale (BeMaS) in its Spanish version in a sample from Lima, Peru. A total of 361 participants were recruited. The sample was then divided into a Training dataset and a Test dataset. First, in the Training dataset, different structural models of the BeMaS were tested, with the nine-item model showing the best fit. Subsequently, the models developed in the Training dataset were tested again in the Test dataset and the complete dataset. The results indicated a better fit for the nine-item model across all tested datasets. Additionally, the instrument’s constructs demonstrated adequate reliability and measurement invariance between men and women. Finally, external validity was assessed by correlating Malicious Envy and Benign Envy with anxiety and depression constructs, with only Malicious Envy showing a relationship with these constructs. In conclusion, the BeMaS is an instrument with adequate psychometric properties, valid, and reliable, although it should be tested in other samples to ensure the robustness of the nine-item model across different samples and contexts.",

          "abstract": "Developmental language disorder (DLD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that affects receptive and expressive language skills. In contrast to the wealth of evidence on acquired language disorders, we understand relatively little about the neural underpinnings of DLD. A recent meta-analysis across different types of structural brain analyses in DLD highlighted consistent anatomical differences in the anterior striatum, with other subcortical structures relatively spared. These findings are consistent with predictions from the procedural circuit deficit hypothesis (PCDH), namely that the anterior neostriatum differs in structure and function in DLD, whereas medial temporal lobe structures are unaffected and may act in a compensatory manner. Here in a case-control study with a larger sample size than previous studies, we evaluated volume and microstructure of subcortical grey matter structures using T1-weighted images and diffusion imaging. Our predictions were partly in accord with those of the procedural circuit deficit hypothesis and the findings of the meta-analysis. Neuroimaging and behavioral measures were acquired in 156 children and adolescents (54 DLD; 74 typically developing; 28 with a history of language difficulties) aged 10:0–15:11 years. As predicted by the PCDH, there were significant differences in the DLD group in volume and microstructure of the neostriatum (caudate nucleus, putamen). However, in contrast to our prediction, there were also significantly smaller structures in the DLD group across other subcortical structures evaluated: globus pallidus, thalamus, and hippocampus. The hippocampal difference is of particular interest as it is hypothesized in the PCDH to be spared in DLD. Microstructural measures (diffusion tensor imaging and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging) revealed differences in the caudate nucleus, thalamus, and hippocampus. Multivariate machine learning analyses highlighted the relationship between the hippocampus and language skills, but only in the typically developing cohort. We conclude that the subcortical correlates of DLD are in fact not limited to the neostriatum and represent important areas of further inquiry.",

Similarly, XR devices are now affordable, lightweight and can be coupled with open-source software for developing experiments. We are now at a time where neuroimaging and XR are paired to investigate new cognitive questions but also to replicate seminal research. Neuro-XR provides cognitive neuroscience and XR-based applications such as medicine, quantitative understanding (through behaviour and neural data) and analysis of real-time interactions/effects.

This paper describes a previously undiscussed limitation of false discovery rate corrections. Specifically, the use of false discovery rate will tend to promote the design and publication of poorly controlled experiments. This occurs because the presence of significant hypothesis tests in some parts of the brain will lower the threshold for significance elsewhere in the brain. The inclusion of a major confound in a design will therefore make it easier to find the expected results by artificially lowering the significance threshold relative to a well-controlled study. Here I demonstrate this basic phenomenon using Monte Carlo simulations. I conduct further simulations to estimate how this phenomenon could affect more realistic confounding scenarios and interact with publication bias. I conclude by suggesting mitigation approaches.",

Dozens of studies have since replicated\nthat finding and extended it using different rules, modalities, stimuli, participants (human adults\nand non-human animals) and experimental procedures. Yet questions remain about the\ngeneralizability of Marcus et al.’s (1999) core findings, and sources of variation across these\nfindings.

This was similarly the\ncase for the moderating factors that were part of the design: mono- vs. multilingualism, age, and\nexperimental paradigm; none of these factors showed significant effects. Robustness analyses\nindicated that the results were not different in the case of different choices in the (pre-)processing\nof the data.

          "abstract": "According to Robert Cummins, the primary explananda of psychology are mental capacities. One fundamental capacity—studied in psychophysics—is the ability to perceive aspects of the physical world. Traditionally, psychophysicists employ behavioral techniques to uncover lawful relationships between physical stimuli and their corresponding responses. However, we argue that theoretical progress in psychophysics has primarily resulted from the development of theories that specify the non-observables underlying these empirical laws. For instance, while Gustav Theodor Fechner utilized discrimination tasks to assess the functional relation between stimulus magnitude and perceived intensity, it was not until the advent of Signal Detection Theory and related Thurstonian models that the underlying mechanisms were theoretically specified. We contend that mathematical models play a crucial role in theoretical psychophysics, as the deductive power of mathematics enables us to generate logically valid and precise predictions from theoretical core assumptions. We illustrate this point by outlining the historical development of mathematical models of stimulus discrimination. Furthermore, we note that theoretical psychophysics in the Thurstonian tradition reflects central meta-theoretical convictions introduced into psychology by Hermann von Helmholtz, and discuss the potential of this approach for cognitive psychology.\n\nKeywords: history of science; philosophy of science; psychophysics; theoretical psychology; scientific laws; mathematical models",

To address this complexity, all stages of the research process—from theory and measurement to study design, analysis, and interventions—must be aligned with a complex systems perspective. This alignment requires intensive interdisciplinary collaboration and an integration of basic and applied research beyond current research practices to create transdisciplinary solutions.

Here we extend this development\nto the multiple-response procedure, and use it to elucidate the\nrelations among the spreads and shapes of the resulting family of\nPMFs, which can be described by their first four cumulants.  For\nexample, we determine conditions under which the PMFs can have the\nsame spread and shape, differing only by translation on the stimulus\naxis.  Whereas PMFs depend on both sensory and decision processes,\ndifferences among the PMFs in a family depend only on the decision\nprocesses.  Application of this \\fImultiple-PMF method \\fRto several\ndecision models, whose evaluations depend on the PMF cumulants, shows it to\nhave greater power than the single-PMF method for understanding the\nperceptual process.

In the\npresent paper, we shed new light on these questions by examining to what extent implicit content\naffects judgments of lying and falsity. 3,660 participants from ten countries (Chile, China, Germany,\nIsrael, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, Spain, the UK, the US) were presented with deceptive\nimplicatures—i.e., utterances that are literally true but implicitly convey false information—and were\nthen asked whether each speaker lied and whether something true or false was said. Our results\nshow that implicit content plays an important role in people’s judgments, leading certain utterances\nto be judged as lies or false even when they are explicitly true. Most strikingly, the result patterns\nwere highly similar across countries.",

          "authors": "Joar Vittersø; Irene Johanna Elisabeth Teulings",
          "abstract": "The combination of high life satisfaction and frequent experiences of pleasant feelings is\nsometimes called hedonic wellbeing (HWB). We argue that a good life comprises more than\nhedonia and that a taxonomy of wellbeing should also include a eudaimonic dimension\n(EWB). The paper challenges a fundamental premise in research on wellbeing, which states\nthat self-reported life satisfaction provides an unbiased, broad, and reflected evaluation of an\nindividual’s life “as-a-whole.” Countering this assumption, two studies showed that HWB\nindicators differ from indicators of EWB, indicating that HWB does not measure EWB. Using\nsurvey experiments, the paper further demonstrated that, upon reflection, participants\ntypically regard eudaimonic values as more important than hedonic values, proposing that\nliving eudaimonically is important in people’s lives. A third finding showed that gaps\nbetween ideal and actual hedonic values predicted life satisfaction, whereas eudaimonic\nvalues gaps did not. This suggests that life satisfaction is not an unbiased evaluation of all the\nimportant values in a person’s life. Thus, measures of life satisfaction appear invalid (not\nmeasuring what they intend to measure). To get more relevant data on how well people\nconsider their lives to be, both hedonic and eudaimonic dimensions should be taken into\naccount.",

          "abstract": "In two pre-registered experiments (exp.1: n=44; exp.2: n=46), we investigated whether emotional inner speech influences heart rate. Participants were asked to engage in sessions of either: self-encouraging positive inner speech, self-degrading negative inner speech, or inner counting while their heart rate was monitored. Participants were lying on a bed and asked to remain still during the inner speech trials. Experiment 1 consisted of two negative, two positive and four counting trials. Experiment 2 had four trials of each type. Trials lasted 180 seconds in experiment 1 and had a mixed duration in experiment 2 (40-70 seconds) to limit predictability. Motion tracking was applied to control for body movement. Median heart rate across each inner speech session was analyzed and a significant difference was found between emotional inner speech and inner counting across both experiments. No difference between positive and negative inner speech was observed. Post-hoc analyses investigated the relationship between movement and heart rate increases and found an effect with a peak lag of approximately 14 seconds. Removing these effects did not change the effect that emotional inner speech had on heart rate. In line with previous literature, additional analyses showed that heart rate and respiration rate were linked. Including respiration rate as a variable in regression analyses did not alter the effect of emotion. The effect of emotional inner speech thus seems robust and demonstrates a causal effect on physiology. No correlations between heart rate effects and measures of depression and rumination were observed. We also discuss the results in relation to possible confounds, such as differences in cognitive effort and inner speech rate.",

          "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, offer significant performance benefits across professional tasks. Yet, their adoption in work-related contexts is complicated by social disapproval and penalties, especially under conditions of mandated transparency. In three studies (one pre-registered; n = 1,678 applicants and n = 477 evaluators), we investigate how people navigate this augmentation-approval tradeoff in an incentivized mini-job application scenario. We find that mandatory disclosure substantially reduces visible AI adoption, but prompts a covert behavioral strategy we term shadow adoption, that is, using AI in ways that avoid detection and disclosure. Strikingly, these shadow AI users produce the highest-quality applications, as rated by HR professionals who are unaware that the outputs were AI-assisted. As the knowledge about the tradeoff spreads, shadow adoption becomes more prevalent, with nearly twice as many people choosing to use shadow AI. These results reveal a misalignment between well-intended transparency rules and user incentives in work-related contexts. Policies and technologies designed to enforce ethical AI use may inadvertently encourage covert behavior, rewarding concealment over compliance.",

The motivation for a post-school pathway (e.g., starting university or vocational training) was examined as a potential predictor of between-person differences in well-being trajectories. German-speaking high school graduates (N = 874 between ages 16 and 20; 69% female, 95% born in Germany) reported on their affective well-being in up to four surveys and indicated their motivation for their post-school pathway.a At three measurement occasions, participants also participated in a three-week experience sampling phase, in which they reported on their daily well-being. Latent change models revealed an initial increase in well-being after graduation, but mixed evidence for subsequent trajectories, as both positive and negative affect decreased on average. Changes in well-being were more pronounced for global than for daily assessments of affective well-being. We did not find associations between the motivation for a post-school pathway and well-being trajectories. Overall, these findings highlight the complexity of well-being trajectories during the transition out of upper secondary education and the importance of using multiple time points and assessment methods to understand these dynamics.",

Experiments 2 and 3 examined the BBS in politically polarized groups of Democrats and Republicans.

In this commentary, we discuss why and how greater integration of affective science with central tenets of, and frameworks from, diversity science —“the study of the interpretation and construction of human differences” — would enhance the field’s understanding of a wide variety of consequential affective phenomena.

          "authors": "Justin Angel",
          "abstract": "The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has enabled a new class of AI psychotherapeutic tools (APTs) that are non-inferior to human therapists and hold the potential to dramatically expand access to mental healthcare worldwide. This paper proposes the ΔAPT framework, which forecasts APT clinical outcomes by linking architectural decisions to validated therapeutic metrics. Through an interdisciplinary AI and psychotherapy critical review, this paper establishes APT success criteria using conventional psychotherapy measurements including symptom reduction scales (PHQ-9, GAD-7), quality-of-life improvements, and therapeutic relationship indicators (WAI). A comparative analysis reveals that newer LLM- driven APTs achieve clinical outcomes non-inferior to human psychotherapists and significantly superior to earlier rules-based chatbots. The ΔAPT framework models how APTs' inherent structural advantages (24/7 availability, negligible cost) counterbalance current technical limitations (hallucinations, sycophancy, bias) and systemic risks (legal ambiguity, safety failures). Specific AI/ML architectural solutions are identified: context engineering techniques (retrieval-augmented generation, chain-of-thought prompting); fine-tuning on 1,000-10,000 hours of diverse therapy modalities beyond CBT; multi-agent architectures for cognitive task distribution; and integrated ML models for safety monitoring. This comprehensive roadmap guides APT developers and researchers in LLM architectural choices and therapeutic modality selection, with the goal of continuously improving clinical outcomes while addressing the global mental health crisis.\n\n\n**Contributions** \nThis paper presents four key contributions for AI/ML and psychotherapy research: First, the ΔAPT framework, which forecasts clinical outcomes by modeling the interplay between APTs'\nstructural advantages (zero-friction intake, extensive memory), technical limitations (LLM operational issues), and systemic risks (legal, ethical, safety concerns). Second, a prioritized analysis of limitations based on prevalence and mitigation feasibility, identifying sycophancy as the most critical unresolved challenge. Third, the first comprehensive taxonomy of hybrid APT architectures, detailing how context engineering, fine-tuning on ethically sourced therapy transcripts, multi-agent design, and ML safety models can be integrated to achieve clinical efficacy. Fourth, evidence that multimodal audio-video technologies are approaching readiness for emotionally attuned therapeutic interactions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Social anxiety and alcohol use disorders are often comorbid. Researchers have identified several psychosocial factors that often maintain social anxiety, such as fear of negative and positive evaluation, post-event processing, and difficulties with emotion regulation. Although evidence suggests that social anxiety disorder and alcohol-related risks are indirectly related via greater anxiety alcohol coping motives, the roles of maintaining psychosocial factors have not yet been tested in a comprehensive model. Therefore, the current cross-sectional study investigated the extent to which these psychosocial mechanisms were related to alcohol use and related problems through social anxiety and anxiety coping-motived drinking. Methods: 476 undergraduate students and community members completed an online survey measuring social anxiety symptoms, psychosocial mechanisms, and alcohol use problems. Results: We conducted a multivariate path analysis and examined eight indirect pathways within this model. Findings support that complex indirect relationships exist between psychosocial factors and alcohol outcomes via social anxiety and coping motives. While difficulties with emotion regulation only demonstrated partial mediation effects, all other psychosocial factors were differentially related to all alcohol-related risks through a combination of indirect-only and inconsistent mediation effects. Implications: These findings support self-medication and biopsychosocial models of social anxiety disorder and highlight the importance of considering the intricate underlying relationships between psychosocial factors, social anxiety symptoms, coping motives, and alcohol-related risks. Moreover, they can help inform evidence-based interventions for comorbid social anxiety and alcohol use disorders by identifying pertinent treatment targets.",

          "abstract": "Digital technologies now shape how people connect, work, relax, and avoid. Yet the psychological sciences lack a unified approach for explaining what sustains these behaviours over time. Existing frameworks are either too broad (e.g., “screen time”) or too narrow (e.g., app features) to capture the functions digital behaviours serve. Here we introduce technological behaviourism, a general theoretical approach grounded in operant conditioning that explains digital engagement through observable antecedents and consequences. Rather than focusing on what people do (e.g., scrolling), this approach is focused on why they do it, in terms of four functions: exploration, esteem, entertainment, and escape. By shifting the lens from form to function, technological behaviourism enables precise, testable analysis of digital engagement and guides the design of context-aware, functionally aligned interventions. It bridges behavioural science with digital environments, offering a scalable, mechanistically grounded approach to understanding and shaping digital behaviour.",

This system, comprised of 24 character strengths attempting to provide a comprehensive set of character dimensions, has inspired a number of studies attempting to define a latent structure for the strengths. The most frequently replicated model across different measures of the strengths, populations, and analytic strategies is comprised of three factors that have been or can be called heart/will/mind, caring/self-control/inquisitiveness, or.morality/self-control/reasoning. Subsequent explorations has suggested this model has relevance beyond the context of character strengths to character in general. Summarizing additional research with the character strengths, research on persona perception, empirical research and theory in education, discussions in moral philosophy, and examples from entertainment, the case is made for considering these three dimensions a Big Three of Character, playing a similar role to the Big Five of Personality. Evidence from person perception and popular culture in particular suggest the model is intuitively appreciated even by youth.",

          "abstract": "When listening to acoustically challenging speech, listeners may have to compensate by shifting their cognitive strategies such as how they use prior context. This shift may depend on the age and hearing acuity of the listener. In the current study, younger adults with normal hearing (N = 48; Exp 1) and older adults with varying hearing acuity (N = 80; Exp 2), listened in quiet and in noise to contextually constraining sentences that ended in an expected word, an unexpected word, or a morphosyntactic violation of the expected word. We recorded EEG and extracted event-related potentials (ERPs) to target words. For younger adults, we observed that the syntactic P600—a component linked to controlled integrative processes—was reduced when listening to speech in background noise. In contrast, an ERP response more strongly yoked to predictive processing, the late frontal response, was present in noise, suggesting that acoustic challenge did not impair predictive processing. For older adults with normal hearing, we observed a small prediction-related ERP response and a robust P600 response in quiet. In noise, the integration-related P600 response to syntactic violations was reduced while the increased syntactic N400 effect increased, suggesting a shift from an integrative mode to reliance on lexical predictions. In quiet, a similar shift towards reduced integration and increased prediction was observed with increasing hearing loss, but these prediction-related effects were severely reduced among older adults with hearing loss when speech was presented in noise, suggesting auditory limits to compensatory reliance on contextual prediction. Collectively, these results suggest that listeners show adaptive shifts between integrative and predictive processing modes as a function of age, acoustic challenge, and hearing acuity.",

Neither of these strategies can be detected in paradigms assessing habits in humans, which are usually conducted in disorder-irrelevant contexts, and this may explain inconsistent evidence for a goal-directed-to-habitual behavior shift in addiction. We tested whether individuals with high-risk drinking behavior rely more on (red)SR, particularly in alcohol-related contexts. Findings suggest that a (reduced) random-policy SR-like strategy contributes to human behavior, but that high-risk drinkers do not differ from low-risk drinkers in their use of this strategy. Instead, both groups rely less on (reduced) random-policy SR and more on model-free control in alcohol-related contexts. Results suggest that (reduced) random-policy SR supports adaptive, resource-efficient behavior and is selectively downregulated in substance-related contexts, highlighting the importance of contextual modulation in understanding decision strategies in mental health.",

In an experiment comparing both instructional treatments on both types of content, we observe a cross-over interaction such that participants learn verbatim facts better from pure practice testing but learn general skills better from example-integrated practice. We use a computational learning architecture, AL, to create an executable theory that explains and predicts these results. Simulated students developed in AL interactively learn from the materials provided in the same four conditions as human learners and reproduce the same cross-over interaction. We further demonstrate that the benefit of integrated examples for general skill learning are a result of, and thus explained by, AL’s inductive learning mechanisms whereas the benefit of practice for verbatim fact learning result from AL’s memory learning mechanisms.",

So far, insights have largely focused on controlled lab-based experimental studies while less is known about individual differences in infants’ curiosity in everyday life. Recently, the Infant and Toddler Curiosity Questionnaire (ITCQ) was developed to examine trait curiosity in infants between 5 to 24 months. Extending this novel tool to Dutch-speaking families, this preregistered study translated the ITCQ to Dutch and examined its psychometric properties in a sample of 316 Dutch-speaking caregivers of infants in The Netherlands (5 to 24 months, 47% female). The results indicated that the ITCQ-NL reliably measures infants’ general curiosity and their curiosity in three subdomains (Sensory, Investigative, and Interactive Curiosity). Furthermore, the ITCQ-NL showed moderate to good reliability over time (n = 218). Finally, we provide evidence of the questionnaire’s construct validity by relating the construct to established temperament measures. To conclude, this study demonstrates the reliability and validity of the ITCQ-NL for assessing individual differences in infants’ everyday trait curiosity in a Dutch population. Our instrument will also facilitate the exploration of cross-cultural differences and comparisons across methodological approaches.",

In both, children needed to coordinate between simple mathematical operations (counting and addition), and reconstructing an agent's visual or mental perspective. Although all senior kindergarteners were proficient in counting, and the majority of them passed the false-belief task, the false belief and number task has proven surprisingly difficult, and was not mastered before age 8.

          "abstract": "Later life involves critical financial and healthcare decisions, such as how to manage one's income in retirement. With ageing populations and increased individual responsibilities, understanding the impact of healthy cognitive ageing on decision-making is crucial. While the effect of ageing on basic cognitive abilities has been examined widely, its effects on decision-making remain underexplored. To address the latter, we conducted a large (n = 357), pre-registered online experiment comparing decision-making and basic cognitive functioning between younger (18-30) and older (65+) adults. Older adults made significantly lower quality decisions. The decline in decision-making capacity is primarily explained by lower performance on tasks of basic cognitive abilities and not age, education, or motivation. Despite investing more time, older adults explored fewer decision options and were more overconfident. These findings suggest that healthy cognitive ageing impairs decision-making capacity due to cognitive decline, with important implications for policy and choice architecture design, particularly in ageing populations.",

          "authors": "Julia M. Rohrer; Vincent Arel-Bundock",
          "abstract": "Psychological researchers usually make sense of regression models by interpreting coefficient estimates directly. This works well enough for simple linear models, but is more challenging for more complex models with, for example, categorical variables, interactions, non-linearities, and hierarchical structures. Here, we introduce an alternative approach to making sense of statistical models. The central idea is to abstract away from the mechanics of estimation, and to treat models as “counterfactual prediction machines,” which are subsequently queried to estimate quantities and conduct tests that matter substantively. This workflow is model-agnostic; it can be applied in a consistent fashion to draw causal or descriptive inference from a wide range of models. We illustrate how to implement this workflow with the marginaleffects package, which supports over 100 different classes of models in R and Python, and present two worked examples. These examples show how the workflow can be applied across designs (e.g., observational study, randomized experiment) to answer different research questions (e.g., associations, causal effects, effect heterogeneity) while facing various challenges (e.g., controlling for confounders in a flexible manner, modelling ordinal outcomes, and interpreting non-linear models).",

The cultural logic of “honour” is frequently studied in relation to conflict, but its role in competition and cooperation remains underexplored. The current study investigates how perceived normative and personally endorsed honour values predict competition and cooperation behaviours. In an online experiment testing pre-registered hypotheses, 3,371 participants from 13 societies made incentivized competition decisions in a contest game and cooperation decisions for coordination in a step-level public goods game. Perceived normative honour values were associated with greater competition and also greater cooperation at both societal and individual levels. Personally endorsing values tied to defence of family reputation was associated with greater coordinative efforts, whereas endorsing self-promotion and retaliation was associated with weaker engagement in coordination. These findings highlight the role of honour as a cultural logic (in its different forms) in shaping competition and cooperation across societies.",

          "abstract": "Selective attention deficits have been linked to increased distractibility, mental fatigue, and sensory overload in patients with acquired brain injury (ABI). Research on measuring and training selective attention is limited and focused on a single sensory modality. In the current study, we tested the psychometric properties of a new, digitalized selective attention measure, the adapted Bourdon-Wiersma test in 26 healthy participants. We also used this measure to test the efficacy of a new computerized selective attention training called “The Botanist and the Animals” in 17 ABI patients. The training was hypothesized to help patients regain control over sensory experiences, without intending to restore cognitive functions. Both the measure and training involved multiple sensory modalities. Results showed variable psychometric properties of the adapted Bourdon-Wiersma test. Selective attention training in ABI patients showed near transfer effects on this measure, although only 35% of the patients showed reliable improvements. No far transfer effects to other cognitive measures were observed, yet exploratory analyses indicated improvements in self-reported rehabilitation participation, cognitive difficulties, and quality of life. Potentially, active engagement in the training helped ABI patients to boost their confidence in daily life, yet the specificity and long-term effects of the training need further assessment.",

          "abstract": "Cochlear implants (CIs) are neural prostheses that restore some level of hearing capacity, albeit\nconveying a less fine-grained speech signal than normal hearing conditions. For example, CIs\nconvey altered fundamental frequency (F0) information, disrupting the perception of lexical stress\n(e.g., distinguishing between the noun CONtent and the adjective conTENT) in languages in which\nthis feature rests on F0 modulations. CI-users can compensate for the degraded nature of the\nacoustic input by exploiting the audiovisual affordances of human communication, weighing more\nheavily the visual information provided by the speaker (e.g., lip movements and gestures). Recent\nstudies showed that, in individuals with normal hearing, the timing of simple up-and-down\nmovements of the hand (i.e., beat gestures) biases lexical stress perception. The present study tested\nif the timing of beat gestures produced by an avatar can bias Dutch lexical stress perception in\nvocoded speech, which simulates CI-hearing conditions. The bias induced by beat gestures in\nvocoded speech was particularly pronounced when hearing an ambiguous or the least frequent\nstress pattern in Dutch. These results suggest that (even artificially generated) beat gestures can be\nused to support speech perception in CI-mediated speech, especially when processing words with\nprosodic features that are less frequent.",

This study examined associations between suicidal ideation and emotion-processing difficulties, coping strategies, resilience, and cognitive functioning after moderate-severe TBI.\n\nMethod: This was a secondary analysis of data from 106 individuals with moderate-severe TBI. Suicidal ideation and emotional distress were assessed using the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), respectively. Participants also completed measures of emotional lability and detachment (Comprehensive Assessment of Traits Relevant to Personality Disorders [CAT-PD]), coping (Coping Scale for Adults), resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), and cognitive functioning, including subjective (CAT-PD, Brief Rating of Executive Function) and objective measures (Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone). Spearman’s correlations and path models were used to examine psychological and cognitive correlates of suicidal ideation.\n\nResults: Suicidal ideation was positively associated with emotional lability, emotional detachment, non-productive coping, and self-reported cognitive problems, and negatively associated with resilience. Path models indicated that emotional distress accounted for 76–100% of these associations. Conversely, suicidal ideation was not significantly associated with adaptive coping or objective cognitive performance.\n\nConclusions: Emotion processing, non-productive coping strategies, low resilience, and self-reported cognitive problems are linked to suicidal ideation in individuals with moderate-severe TBI, primarily through their associations with emotional distress. Findings underscore the importance of addressing emotional distress, including depression and anxiety, and its underlying contributors in suicide prevention for this population.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Discrepancies have previously been observed between the numerical mathematics problem solving of autistic children and their solving of worded mathematics problems, with the latter perceived as an area of challenge. While there are many reasons why this challenge may exist (e.g., reading comprehension and executive function differences), one, as yet untapped, explanation is the specific mathematical concepts assessed which may confound comparisons across assessments. \n\nMethods: In this study, 43 autistic children (32 male, 11 female) aged 6- to 12-years completed four assessments of mathematics problems: WIAT-III subscales of Numerical Operation and Mathematical Problem Solving, and two bespoke subscales (numerical and worded) matched on mathematical concepts and difficulty across numerical and worded problem sets. \n\nResults: We found that while performance in the worded problems subscale of the WIAT-III was significantly lower than the numerical problem subscale, there was no significant difference between the two task types in the bespoke measures. \n\nConclusion: Our results suggest that differences in mathematical concepts assessed between worded and numerical problems may explain challenges experienced by autistic children in worded problems, rather than reading comprehension alone. As such, when drawing conclusions about the mathematics performance of autistic children, careful consideration of the mathematics concepts evaluated is needed. These findings also have implications for the development of formal school assessments and research on mathematics skills in autistic children.",

          "abstract": "The question of whether humans have free will or not is longstanding in the areas of philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience. While the issue has not been resolved, determinist and compatibilist frameworks have received support from the neuropsychological data. In both cases, decisions are made within a broader framework of causal determinism. If thoughts and behaviours are inevitable consequences of a continuous chain of cause-effect events, why do we feel free? Here, we propose a neuropsychological model for the experience of free will as a conditioned illusion – a misattribution of causality reinforced through operant learning. Drawing on classical findings such as the readiness potential preceding conscious intention and more recent work on active inference, we argue that the temporal contiguity of premotor and motor activations gives rise to superstitious conditioning, shaping an experience of – and belief in – free will that is compatible with determinism. Sustained by dopaminergic circuits and reinforced by sensorimotor feedback loops, our framework situates free will as an experiential phenomenon rooted in the functional neuroanatomy of learning. We discuss implications for medicine, ethics, law, and suggest conditions under which the experience of free will may be disrupted or restructured by disease, pharmacology, and reinforcement history.",

          "abstract": "Several prominent theories of eating disorders maintenance exist, with most corresponding to evidence-based treatments. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is an ideal method for testing relationships between proposed maintenance factors and eating disorder symptoms given its ability to examine antecedents and consequences. A seminal systematic review and meta-analysis of EMA studies on affect and binge eating was published in 2011, but the literature since this time and beyond these variables has not been synthesized. We searched PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Scopus (last search March 31, 2025) for articles using EMA to study psychological/contextual variables in relation to a core eating disorder symptom in people with an eating disorder or eating disorder symptom. After screening, 179 papers were included. The majority examined affect in relation to binge eating or loss of control (LOC) eating, although affect was also considered in relation to purging, restriction, exercise, and body checking. Whereas negative affect primarily drives binge eating/LOC eating and purging, positive affect appears more relevant for exercise and (perhaps) restriction. Surprisingly few studies have considered how ED-related cognitive, affective, or behavioral variables relate to eating disorder symptoms, despite these being primary associations in leading maintenance/treatment models of eating disorders. Most studies have investigated samples of exclusively women, with some having a small proportion of male participants, and only two samples were comprised of all or almost all men. Future EMA research on eating disorders should go beyond studying affect to test whether relationships proposed in established maintenance models can be observed in daily life.",

This study leverages computational text analysis of over 250,000 U.S. congressional speeches from 1880 to 2020 to examine the evolution of intentionality framing—rhetoric focusing on immigrants' motives, desires, and goals. Using GPT-4 to identify intentionality cues, we find a significant increase in intentionality framing since the mid-20th century, coinciding with growing polarization between Democrats and Republicans. Crucially, pro-immigration discourse increasingly emphasizes positive intentions, while anti-immigration rhetoric has become more behaviorist, focusing on external impacts rather than internal states. This rhetorical divergence intensifies during periods of heightened political polarization. Our findings highlight how political actors strategically mobilize psychological intuitions about intent to mobilize voter support and underscore the role of perceived intentionality in shaping social and moral evaluations of immigrant groups.",

Studies 2a (N = 1,506) and 2b (N = 1,255), conducted as one-week longitudinal studies during the 2024 European and French parliamentary elections, revealed that an information treatment emphasizing deservingness cues strongly reduced misperceptions about immigrants, modestly reduced opposition to immigration, and had an even smaller effect for anti-immigration voting. These findings suggest that while immigrants are often perceived negatively, emphasizing perceived deservingness can mitigate prejudice, presenting a promising strategy for reducing anti-immigration bias.",

          "abstract": "For many years the accepted wisdom in vision science has been that humans tend to underestimate the speed of an object when they pursue it with their gaze in comparison to when they fixate a spot in the visual scene and the object moves across the retina, an effect that is referred to as the Aubert-Fleischl phenomenon. However, experiments on the Aubert-Fleischl effect have generally employed a target moving in front of a blank background. For objects moving in the real world, relative motion between the object and the background provides additional cues, potentially allowing the visual system to compensate for the Aubert-Fleischl phenomenon. To test this hypothesis, we asked 50 participants to compare the speed of a single sphere to the speed of a sphere-cloud in a two-interval forced-choice task while they either followed the single sphere with their gaze or kept their eyes on a fixation cross. Stimuli were presented in virtual reality and the sphere’s movement could occur either in a completely black environment with no relative motion cues present, or against a visible, textured background behind the moving sphere. The probe sphere-cloud always moved in front of the same background as the target. In a large data set (n = 50), we found no evidence for an Aubert-Fleischl effect, i.e., no evidence for an underestimation of speed during pursuit relative to fixation, in either of the environments. Our results challenge the prevailing notion that object speed is underestimated when the object is pursued versus when fixation is maintained and highlights the necessity to take into account characteristics of the visual scene.",

Results revealed three distinctive grit trajectories over four years: Moderate-Decreasing (72.9%), Low-Stable (17.6%), and High-Decreasing (9.5%). Parenting styles characterized by rejection and chaos predicted class membership. Adolescents in the High-Decreasing class reported the highest levels of psychological well-being, followed by those in the Moderate-Decreasing and Low-Stable classes.

Moreover, both species benefitted from category structures that had multiple category-relevant dimensions (i.e., dense categories). In addition, human adults, who have a more advanced ability to attend selectively, showed faster learning and better generalization overall. Finally, attention was optimized to the category-relevant dimension in the sparse category only in human adults.

While previous research used confidence ratings to implicitly infer knowledge gaps, the impact of making these gaps explicitly salient to people on their information-seeking behavior remains unclear. Here, we investigated this question across two preregistered experiments (Experiment 1: \\textit{n} = 501, Experiment 2: \\textit{n} = 511 participants). Participants first took a knowledge test on elephant conservation in Botswana. Subsequently, participants repeatedly decided to either read or skip a chapter of an article covering different subtopics on elephant conservation in Botswana, before they took the same test again. We manipulated the salience of knowledge gaps by illustrating pretest performance scores to the experimental group, while the control group received no such information. In Experiment 2, we instructed participants after the pretest that a posttest would follow at the end of the experiment and thereby intended to increase the utility of information seeking. Our results provide converging evidence that illustrating moderate knowledge gaps significantly increased participants' probability of seeking information by reading the chapters. In Experiment 2, illustrating moderate knowledge gaps was not only associated with increased information-seeking behavior, but also led to significantly greater gains in posttest performance compared to the control group. Altogether, our findings open new avenues for research on leveraging knowledge gap illustrations to deliberately stimulate curiosity, thereby increasing information-seeking behavior and knowledge acquisition.",

          "authors": "Luca Blumhardt; Justin Harris",
          "abstract": "Research over the last decade has shown that the value associated with a perceptually salient stimulus enhances its ability to attract attention towards itself. This phenomenon, called value-modulated attentional capture (VMAC), has relevance to a wide variety of psychological matters. Thus, an understanding of the conditioning processes that are responsible for VMAC can provide further insight into these matters. Almost all the literature argues that a Pavlovian conditioning process and not an information-seeking process is responsible for VMAC. However, there are grounds to question whether this is always the case. The current article reviewed the empirical research that has been conducted, or could potentially be used, to investigate the learning processes that are responsible for VMAC. It established that much research has been too limited to determine what processes are responsible for VMAC, but much research has not. Specifically, research that has found VMAC arising in its entirety before awareness of the stimulus-value association is acquired and taking place regardless of whether reward information is devalued later in training provides evidence of Pavlovian conditioning. However, research that has found VMAC arising when points feedback is withheld and individuals are informed of the stimulus-value association, and only taking place when reward information is not devalued when information devaluation is manipulated from the start of training, provides evidence of information-seeking. Thus, the findings of the research suggest that either process may give rise to VMAC and that it is the conditions under which VMAC is established that determines what process is responsible for it – Pavlovian conditioning will be responsible for VMAC when information-seeking is precluded, and information-seeking will be responsible for VMAC when Pavlovian conditioning is precluded.",

          "title": "Exploring landscape burning as the earliest active use of fire",
          "authors": "Femke H. Reidsma; Amanda Henry",
          "abstract": "Fire is a key component of human technology, but when and how we first developed the ability to use and create fire remains heavily debated. Some argue that control of fire developed early and quickly became an essential tool for cooking food, based on morphological changes that first appeared in Homo erectus. Others emphasize the lack of widespread and consistent traces of fire in the early archaeological record, and argue that control of fire came relatively late, post 500ka. In looking for archaeological evidence for fire use, most studies focus on the co-occurence of fire traces and other signs of human activity (e.g., stone tools, cut-marked bones). This assumes that our ancestors first focused on the idea of the hearth, either bringing the fire back to the activity area, or performing activities near a spatially-constrained fire. However, recent research has highlighted the potential importance of intentional burning of landscapes as a tool that could similarly provide nutritional and energetic benefits to the earliest hominin fire users. If landscape burning was the first type of intentional fire use, then we should not expect the co-occurrence of fire traces and other signs of hominin activity. Inspired in part by Wil Roebroeks’ emphasis on off-site activities and longstanding interest in fire, here we provide a suggestion for a new approach to explore the archaeological record for evidence of intentional landscape burning. Future analyses using this approach may help us better understand the deep history of fire use and resolve the potential mismatch between the early appearance of morphological traits associated with the consumption of cooked food and the late co-occurrence of fire traces and hominin activity in the archaeological record.",

          "authors": "Simón Peña-Fernández; Urko Peña-Alonso; Ainara Larrondo-Ureta; Jordi Morales-i-Gras",
          "abstract": "Journalists have incorporated social networks into their work as a standard tool, enhancing their ability to produce and disseminate information and making it easier for them to connect more directly with their audiences. However, this greater presence in the digital public sphere has also increased their exposure to harassment and hate speech, particularly in the case of women journalists. This study analyzes the presence of harassment and hate speech in responses (n = 60,684) to messages that 200 journalists and media outlets posted on X (formerly Twitter) accounts during the days immediately preceding and following the July 23 (23-J) general elections held in Spain in 2023. The results indicate that the most common forms of harassment were insults and political hate, which were more frequently aimed at personal accounts than institutional ones, highlighting the significant role of political polarization—particularly during election periods—in shaping the hostility that journalists face. Moreover, although, generally speaking, the total number of harassing messages was similar for men and women, it was found that a greater number of sexist messages were aimed at women journalists, and an ideological dimension was identified in the hate speech that extremists or right-wing populists directed at them. This study corroborates that this is a minor but systemic issue, particularly from a political and gender perspective. To counteract this, the media must develop proactive policies and protective actions extending even to the individual level, where this issue usually applies.",

Based on semi-structured in-depth interviews with leading experts in the field of critical media literacy, and a survey conducted with 141 university students in Communication and Education programs, this study explores how recent technological advances are linked to challenges in information consumption—such as disinformation, fake news, incidental exposure to information, and deepfakes—as well as the challenges and opportunities these issues present within educational contexts. The results reveal that, although such technologies provide opportunities to improve teaching–learning processes, their inclusion in the curriculum is limited and often superficial. In addition, we identify shortcomings in how teachers are trained to manage these tools effectively, hindering the development of critical thinking by students. The conclusions suggest a need for critical media literacy that not only educates students in the use of technologies but also allows them to question and evaluate the content they consume, all within an ethical and reflective framework that promotes participatory and critical citizenship.",

          "abstract": "Social media have been fundamental in the daily lives of millions of people, but they have raised concerns about content moderation policies, the management of personal data, and their commercial exploitation. The acquisition of Twitter (now X) by Elon Musk in 2022 generated concerns among Twitter users regarding changes in the platform’s direction, prompting a migration campaign by some user groups to the federated network Mastodon. This study reviews the onboarding of users to this decentralised platform between 2016 and 2022 and analyses the migration of 19,000 users who identified themselves as supporters of the platform switch. The results show that the migration campaign was a reactive response to Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter and was led by a group of highly active academics, scientists, and journalists. However, a complete transition was not realised, as users preferred to straddle their presence on both platforms. Mastodon’s decentralisation made it difficult to exactly replicate Twitter’s communities, resulting in a partial loss of these users’ social capital and greater fragmentation of these user communities, which highlights the intrinsic differences between both platforms.",

          "abstract": "Organ allocation policies face a fundamental tension: maximizing total survival benefit\nversus protecting fairness for the sickest patients. Current systems, such as the Model for\nEnd-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), save many lives by prioritizing urgency, but they can reduce\nlong-term survival gains. We introduce Harm-Threshold Utilitarianism (HTU), a framework\nthat seeks to maximize expected post-transplant benefit while enforcing guardrails for epis-\ntemic confidence, catastrophic harm, and computational simplicity. Using retrospective U.S.\nliver transplant registry data, we simulated organ offers under HTU and MELD. HTU consis-\ntently selected candidates with greater predicted post-transplant survival, producing measurable\nimprovements in 5-year restricted mean survival time (≈ 0.25 years per transplant) without\nsystematically abandoning high-risk patients. Sensitivity analyses show that the harm threshold\ngoverns the trade-off between efficiency and urgency, while the epistemic screen curbs over-\nreliance on uncertain model differences. By making these thresholds explicit, HTU transforms\nimplicit value judgments into transparent rules. The approach offers a principled path toward\norgan allocation policies that are both ethically defensible and outcome-improving.",

Data collection methods include an online survey (n=100) and five semi-structured interviews, complemented by biophysical surveys of participants' gardens. Additionally, the interviewed women completed a New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) questionnaire to assess the role of environmental beliefs. Findings reveal a positive correlation between relational values (emotional connection) and sustainable gardening practices, aligning with existing research on the link between human-nature connectedness and positive garden ecosystem services. However, no significant association was found between fundamental ecological beliefs (measured by NEP) and garden-related attitudes or practices.",

Earlier, with less content, our interaction was also limited; however, as the content grew larger, our interaction with it also increased. Over-the-top (OTT) platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+Hotstar have become an integral part of our lives, affecting our Habitus. This study explores the psychosocial, behavioural, and physical effects of these platforms on young adults aged 18 to 30. The researcher employed a questionnaire survey of 111 respondents, in conjunction with existing research. This study investigates the psychosocial effects of binge-watching on young adults and society as a whole. The findings suggest that long watch hours often lead to disturbed sleep, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, mood changes, and a decline in face-to-face engagement with family and friends. While OTT platforms offer unmatched convenience and cultural variety, they also introduce risks that are often overlooked. The study recommends increasing awareness among users, conducting additional research into long-term effects, and implementing proactive measures by policymakers to promote healthier digital habits.",

          "authors": "Tomáš Dvořák",
          "abstract": "This article presents the argument that there are two types of technocratic attitudes in post-communist CEE countries.  the first is unsurprisingly associated with authoritarian attitudes. The latter, however, is not an expression of authoritarianism, but is primarily associated with the so-called democratic deficit: the gap between the importance attached to democracy and (dis)satisfaction with the current state of democratic governance. Previous research has tended to view technocratic attitudes as rather one-dimensional; I show that there are in fact two distinct forms – authoritarian and democratic. The results of the study are relevant from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. Technocratic governance thus represents, in the eyes of part of the population of the CEE region, a way of solving the problems of democratic governance.  Technocratic governance is therefore not necessarily and solely associated with authoritarianism, illiberalism, and democratic backsliding, as suggested by the existing scholarly discourse. From an empirical point of view, this study also presents a novel finding: evidence of the heterogeneity associated with technocratic attitudes.",

          "authors": "Fabian Kratz",
          "abstract": "Czymara et al. (2025) find that antisemitism is more prevalent among Muslims than among Christians and the religiously unaffiliated. They examine whether these relationships depend on educational attainment or religiosity and aim to explain them using a set of variables, including region of origin, religiosity, and education. I argue that adopting the estimands approach clarifies the research questions, reveals key identification assumptions, and demonstrates the need for causal mediation analysis. Using this approach, I distinguish between confounders and mediators, present revised estimates of what might be considered total effects, and examine the mediating and moderating roles of education and religiosity. The results indicate that caution is warranted when interpreting the link between Muslim denomination and antisemitism. Without controlling for confounders, total effects are overstated. Furthermore, differences in antisemitism between Muslims and Christians are minor among less religious people. However, even among highly educated Muslims, a substantial gap remains relative to Christians and the unaffiliated. I conclude by outlining how the estimands framework may help accomplish one key aim of Czymara et al. (2025): identifying mechanisms that could inform the design of targeted interventions to mitigate antisemitism.",

          "abstract": "Unlike race or gender, parenthood is not a distinct ground of protection under most anti-discrimination laws. Yet, evidence of motherhood penalties in the labor market is well documented. To systematically assess parenthood discrimination in employers' hiring decisions across countries and time, we conducted the first meta-analysis of correspondence studies in this field. We synthesized data from 23 studies (N = 65,440 applications) across 11 countries between 1978 to 2022. Using random-effects models, we calculate discrimination risk ratios and conducted subgroup analyses to examine variation by applicant characteristics, occupational context, and national family policies. Our main findings are: (I) Statistically significant status-based discrimination against parents is evident—but primarily driven by anticipated rather than realized parenthood, as it almost exclusively affects women. (II) These penalties are more pronounced in countries lacking supportive family policies, such as paid maternity leave and high female part-time employment. (III) While parents are not systematically penalized across occupations, women—independent of parental status—face discrimination in management roles, and (though not significantly) in highly qualified and male-dominated occupations.",

          "authors": "Matthias Kuppler",
          "abstract": "This study analyzes the exchange of book translations between countries. Existing research is split over the question of whether translation flows are driven by literary, economic, political, or cultural factors. The forces that stratify countries into centers and peripheries are thus debated. To advance the debate, this study leverages newly collected data on N = 147,443 translations of literary works to reconstruct the network of translation flows between 32 European countries for the time period from 2018 to 2020. The relative impacts of literary prestige, economic infrastructure, state support, and cultural proximity on translation flows are estimated with Generalized Additive Models and the Quadratic Assignment Procedure. Results indicate that translation flows are best explained by a combination of literary prestige and economic infrastructure. Translations flow from countries with high literary prestige and a strong publishing infrastructure to countries with little prestige and weak infrastructure. The transnational circulation of literature appears as a game in which economic infrastructure confers power and in which the accumulation of literary prestige is the ultimate stake. This suggests a logic of competition in which translations are the medium through which economic power is converted into symbolic recognition. In this view, the market logic and the artistic logic are not contradictory orientations but different steps in ongoing accumulation processes. Although these conclusions are specific to the European literary field, they document a novel viewpoint that is not reducible to established arguments that point to either convergence or divergence of art and commerce.",

          "authors": "Alicea Peyton",
          "abstract": "This article explores the historical and spatial conditions that necessitated Black ecclesial autonomy in the United States, beginning with Absalom Jones’s appointment as the first Black pastor of a mainstream Christian denomination and culminating in the rise of contemporary Black mega churches. Using the framework of land-use enforcement and religious zoning as outlined in The Evolution of Land-Use Enforcement Related to The Religious Storefront Church Movement (Williams-Peyton, 2019), the article traces how exclusionary zoning, denominational gatekeeping, and intra-racial class tensions shaped the road from Black mainstream denominations to the emergence of storefront churches and their architectural successors. Through historical analysis and visual typology—including Table 2’s storefront church models—this study argues that Black religious space has always been a site of resistance, creativity, and contested legitimacy.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, the article applies Wilson’s Evolution of Information Behavior Modeling (1999) to interpret these spatial and theological adaptations as dynamic responses to information needs. Congregants’ pursuit of sanctified space is framed as information-seeking behavior shaped by environmental, psychological, and social variables. The creation of sovereign pews emerges not only as architectural ingenuity but as informational agency rooted in trauma, resilience, and theological innovation. By situating these ecclesial strategies within a broader information behavior framework, the article bridges urban ministry, LIS theory, and cultural preservation.",

Interestingly, we find mixed effects of the interventions on total engagement: while the numbers of comments and commenters decreased after the ?rirst intervention, both metrics increased after the second.

          "authors": "Ian Lundberg",
          "abstract": "Segregation---whether across schools, neighborhoods, or occupations---is regularly invoked as a cause of social and economic disparities. But segregation is a complicated causal treatment: what do we mean when we appeal to a world in which segregation does not exist? One could take societal contexts as the unit of analysis and compare across societies with differing levels of segregation. In practice, it is more common for studies of segregation to take persons or households as the unit of analysis within a single societal context, focusing on what would happen if particular individuals were counterfactually assigned to social positions in a more equitable way. Taking this latter framework, this paper shows how to study segregation as a cause. The first step is to theorize a counterfactual assignment rule: what would it mean to assign people to social positions equitably? The second step is to identify the causal effect of those social positions and simulate counterfactual outcomes. The third step is to interpret results as the impact of a unit-level (rather than society-level) intervention. A running example and empirical analysis illustrates the approach by studying the causal effect of occupational segregation on a racial health gap.",

          "abstract": "The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) is unsettling regimes of knowledge production and dissemination in higher education. Cultural competence (CC) is recognised as a core graduate capability for global citizenship and professional effectiveness, yet empirical evidence on how Gen AI can nurture CC remains scarce. This study investigates how an in-house Gen AI chatbot can cultivate CC in university students. Guided by the ACT model of cultural competence, transformational learning theory, and critical pedagogy, we conducted a qualitative study of student experiences with an AI-simulated debate platform that stages contested dialogues and provides rubric-based feedback. 32 undergraduates at a Thai university engaged in three debates and reflective questionnaire. Thematic analysis indicates meaningful growth across all ACT domains—Activating consciousness, Connecting relations, and Transforming practices. The AI-mediated simulations exposed learners to disorienting uncertainties, reconfiguring cognitive schemas, catalysing critical reflection, and prompting action oriented toward social justice; participants also reported heightened AI literacy. The intervention thus enabled transformative pedagogy across cultural contexts, while underscoring the imperative for universities to purposefully integrate AI in order to equip graduates with future-critical skills. However, remaining ambiguities concerning the shifting positionalities of educators, learners, and AI warrant further investigation.",

          "authors": "Wendy Wagenaar; Marieke Christina van Egmond; Joyce Bierbooms",
          "abstract": "Background: Digital health technologies offer promising opportunities to support physical health. However, their acceptance, use and associated benefits are not equally distributed across society. While existing research has mainly focused on traditional socioeconomic indicators, broader sociological influences, including economic, cultural, social and personal capital, may provide a more comprehensive understanding of these inequalities. Yet, too little is currently known about how these forms of capital relate to individuals’ intentions to acceptance and use digital health technologies.\n\nObjectives: This study aimed to: (1) identify distinct subgroups of individuals based on their acceptance and use of digital technologies to support their physical health; and (2) examine how these subgroups differ in terms of economic, cultural, social and personal capital.\n\nMethods: We used cross-sectional data from the LISS panel (Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences), including data from the LISS Core Study on health, economic situation, and social integration and leisure. To supplement this data, we conducted an additional online survey in November 2023 via the LISS panel to assess participants' acceptance and use of digital technologies to support their physical health. The final sample included 1,096 participants. We applied three-step Latent Class Analysis to identify subgroups based on constructs from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Post hoc comparisons were used to characterize the subgroups based on 22 indicators of economic, cultural, social and personal capital.\n\nResults: Five subgroups were identified: neutral users (43.8%), uninterested users (21.4%), engaged users (20.6%), resistant users (9.3%) and enthusiastic users (4.8%). The largest group, neutral users, neither fully adopted nor rejected digital technologies to support their physical health. Higher levels of economic, cultural and social capital were generally associated with greater acceptance and use of digital health technologies. However, personal capital showed a different pattern: neutral users reported low self-confidence despite moderate use, while resistant users reported high self-image despite low acceptance and use. This suggests that personal capital does not always align with traditional predictors of digital engagement.\n\nConclusions: Our findings highlight the need to move beyond socioeconomic indicators when addressing digital health inequalities. Broader factors, including economic, cultural, social and personal capital, should be considered when developing strategies to promote equitable acceptance and use of digital health technologies across society.",

          "authors": "Maik Hamjediers",
          "abstract": "Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 marked a turning point in European security politics. In this context, the population's willingness to fight is often interpreted as an indicator of societal inclination toward military self-defense and a precondition for strengthening defensive capacities. Yet, causal evidence on what shapes this willingness remains limited, and studies on the effects of Russia's invasion on public attitudes have been largely confined to European countries. I employ Russia's invasion within an unexpected event during survey design to estimate its impact on respondents' willingness to fight for their own country. Drawing on data from the World Values Survey in the Czech Republic and Uruguay, the analysis reveals a significant increase in willingness to fight among Czech respondents -- a country geographically and historically proximate to Russia -- but no comparable effect in Uruguay. These findings offer novel causal evidence that proximate interstate conflict can increase willingness to fight for one's country, which contributes to broader debates on conscription and military security.",

          "abstract": "This article examines the infrastructuring of the European Union’s Entry/Exit System (EES) at the juxtaposed border controls of the United Kingdom and France. Drawing on expert interviews, industry conferences, and fieldwork conducted at the ports of Dover, Calais, and the Eurotunnel terminals, it traces the detours EES has taken on its journey from imaginary to implementation in response to material, political, and technical challenges. Requirements for the system such as capturing fingerprints to fulfil eu-LISA's interoperability objectives and enrolling biometrics within ‘line of sight’ of a European border guard have created thorny problems at the Channel ports where travellers arrive to the border in vehicles rather than on foot. Solving these problems has necessitated hard infrastructures and political compromises which have provided opportunities for other actors to influence the sociodigital future of EES through infrastructuring their preferred solutions. The fact that what EES is and will be has changed substantially before it has even entered into operation, shows the moment of suspension, between when work on a system starts and before it is complete, to be a decisive one for materially intervening in sociodigitial futures in the making.",

          "authors": "Rotem Medzini",
          "abstract": "The ‘assurance problem’ has traditionally centred around verifying that ‘tangible’ products and services comply with legal or regulatory standards through state-led, self-regulatory, or third-party assurances. Its modern accounts focus on proving the trustworthiness of digital services, especially AI-powered ones. This paper applies the regulatory intermediation framework to assess whether third-party assurances, especially those provided by the European New Approach to Technical Harmonisation and Standards, effectively provide assurances, including digital assurances, compared to centralised, state-led authorities. It addresses three key questions: (1) Who are the regulatory intermediaries providing assurance for digital services under the New Approach? (2) How does reliance on these intermediaries differ across three regimes, specifically, the Medical Device Regulation, certifications under the General Data Protection Regulation, and the regulation of high-risk AI under the AI Act? (3) How do these intermediaries perceive the strengths and weaknesses of relying on third-party assurance under the New Approach in providing effective assurances when compared to centralised state-led approaches? This paper utilises document analysis, expert interviews, and stakeholder workshops to identify four key intermediary groups involved in standard setting and conformity assessment, and maps how the three regimes assign responsibilities to them to provide assurances to varying degrees. The paper then demonstrates how intermediaries perceive the strengths and weaknesses of these third-party assurances compared to centralised state-led assurances. It argues that their familiarity and knowledge regarding procedures, interactions, organisational structures, and routines related to their responsibilities can lead to more effective assurances, especially digital ones, with them acting as protectors of fundamental rights, health, and safety.",

          "authors": "Samuel Coavoux; Abel Aussant",
          "abstract": "Do digital technologies affect diversity in cultural tastes? Digital sociologists have warned of “filter bubbles,” attributed to shifts in the way culture is accessed online, and of persisting digital inequalities, while sociologists of culture have shown that diversity in consumption is valued as a marker of upper-middle-class status. Few empirical studies have connected these findings. We estimate the effect of using streaming platforms on the diversity of cultural consumption using survey data from France. We apply template matching to adjust for six sets of confounders. We find a significant, positive effect of using streaming platforms on the diversity of cultural consumption, measured by the number of cultural genres declared to be consumed, across three domains (music, movies, and TV shows) as well as on cosmopolitanism, measured by the propensity to watch movies and TV shows in a foreign language. The magnitude of this effect is relatively low for music(0.1 sd, 0.2 genres), intermediate for movies (0.2 sd, 0.6 genres), but high for TV shows (0.46 sd, 1.2 genres). The study brings new evidence against the filter bubble thesis; it shows that platforms do reinforce cultural inequalities by increasing the gap in consumption diversity between the working classes and the elite. It further suggests that the effect of technology on cultural consumption might be mainly mediated through its impact on cultural markets rather than changes in cultural experience.",

          "abstract": "For a variety of reasons, including a need to save time and a desire to reduce biases in outcomes, some funders of research have started to use partial randomisation in their funding decision processes. The effect that randomisation interventions have on the reliability of those processes should, it is argued, be a consideration in their use, but this key aspect of their implementation remains under-appreciated. Using a simple specification of a research proposal peer review process, simulations are carried out to explore the ways in which decision reliability, bias, extent of decision randomisation and other factors interact. As might be expected, based on both logic and existing knowledge, randomisation has the potential to reduce bias, but it may also reduce decision reliability as inferred from the F1 score and accuracy of a simulated binary (successful, rejected) decision outcome classification process. Bias is also found, in one sense and qualitatively, to be rather insensitive to partial randomisation as it is typically applied in real-world situations. The simple yet apparently effective specification of the simulation of reviewer scores implemented here may also provide insights into the distribution of merit across research funding proposals, and of assessment of them.",

From the first sharpened stick to contemporary algorithms, functional artifacts accumulate meaning until the symbol eclipses the tool. Digital platforms accelerate this dynamic, manufacturing personalized illusions at planetary scale. Combining historical genealogy with three case studies: gamification, cryptocurrency, and the metaverse, I map a tri-phasic transformation: (1) pre-modern myths and rituals coordinated collective action; (2) modern promises of progress and control legitimated industrial rationalization; (3) digital engagement engines harvest behavioral data while posing as free, authentic connection. Drawing on Baudrillard, Debord, and Zuboff, I reveal the political economy that converts attention into profit yet sustains the appearance of choice. Contradictions remain: outages, opt-out movements, and open-source platforms expose cracks in the spectacle. I argue that symbolic beings cannot escape illusion; they can only inhabit it wisely. Four practices: illusion literacy, strategic inhabitation, temporal sovereignty, and creative misuse, outline how phronesis might redistribute agency within the fictions that make cooperation possible.",

          "authors": "ANGELICA JEANICE MARTINS ANDERSEN",
          "abstract": "This article develops a semantic-pragmatic analysis methodology for identifying linguistic manipulation strategies in media texts. Through the application of six mechanisms – implicature, presupposition, pragmatic inferences, modality, genericity, and nominalisation (AUSTIN, 1975; CARLSON, 2011; GRICE, 1975; HEUSINGER; MAIENBORN; PORTNER, 2011; SIMONS, 2005; SPERBER; WILSON, 1995; STALNAKER, 1973; VON FINTEL, 2006) — I propose an analytical model that demonstrates how these linguistic resources can be exploited to create interpretive distortions. Although other mechanisms are available, I focus on these six as they are persistent in misinformation contexts. The analysis identifies five main manipulative strategies: (1) suggestion of biased meanings without explicit commitment to truth conditions, (2) naturalisation of controversial content as established fact, (3) obscuring the degree of commitment between epistemic necessity and deontic obligation, (4) promotion of essentialist universalisations, and (5) suppression of information about agents and responsibilities. The linguistic strategies that sustain misinformation are exemplified through a viral 2023 news story about inclusive terminology for transgender patients in healthcare. The case study serves as a paradigmatic example to demonstrate mechanisms commonly employed by misinformation fabricators. The results contribute to the semantics-pragmatics interface by operationalising the distinction between what is said and what is implicated, revealing how context-dependency mechanisms can be instrumentalised for manipulation, offering perspectives on semantic compositionality and pragmatic inferential processes, and contributing to media literacy and the growing field of digital pragmatics.",

The findings reveal that minority representation increases single-family housing construction at the expense of multi-family housing, challenging conventional expectations about ideology and race. Qualitative interviews with city council members suggest that efforts to address minority underrepresentation drive active support for single-family housing, while distrust of developers—rooted in fears of gentrification—fuels skepticism toward multi-family projects. Overall, the study presents a nuanced view of racial representation: while minorities achieve better representational outcomes, these gains can come with costs.",

Realistic group conflict theory predicts as much. We join this theory with recent research that treats ethnic/racial classification as an outcome. We report the results of conjoint survey experiments with two samples, one of undergraduates from diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds, the other of U.S. resident adults. By randomly varying whether respondents racially classify hypothetical profiles completing a scholarship application or an anonymous survey, we examine under what conditions people are more or less likely to classify others as White, Black, Latino, Asian, MENA or POC. We also test whether classification relies more on ascriptive factors (skin tone or descent) when presumed benefits are involved. Our experiments uncover evidence that respondents rely more on ancestry when deciding whether scholarship candidates are White. However, for other classifications, the substantive differences between the scholarship and survey conditions are small, and respondents from different backgrounds behave similarly. These results are consistent with the basic thesis that stakes matter; they also highlight widely shared concerns about fairness and claiming disadvantage inappropriately.",

          "authors": "martina mchenga",
          "abstract": "Abstract\nPurpose: Corporal punishment by teachers remains one of the most pervasive forms of school-based violence in sub-Saharan Africa, undermining adolescent wellbeing and educational attainment despite statutory prohibitions. While most research has focused on prevalence, teacher behaviours, or household risk factors, little is known about how adolescents’ own beliefs and peer normative environments shape their vulnerability to teacher violence.\n\nMethods: This study analysed nationally representative Violence Against Children Surveys (VACS) from five countries: Eswatini (2021), Mozambique (2019), Kenya (2019), Namibia (2019), and Lesotho (2018), focusing on 10,904 school-going adolescents aged 13-17 years. Logistic regression models estimated associations between individual endorsement of corporal punishment, peer-level attitudes (measured using leave-one-out peer endorsement), and reported experience of teacher violence. Results were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.\n\nFindings: show that 13.6% of adolescents reported teacher corporal punishment in the past year. More than half (52.8%) endorsed corporal punishment, with peer endorsement averaging 53%. Adolescents who endorsed corporal punishment had twice the odds of experiencing teacher violence (aOR=2.1, 95% CI:1.6-2.7). Each 10-percentage-point increase in peer endorsement was associated with a 10% increase in odds (aOR=1.1, 95% CI: 1.0-1.2). Gender moderated these associations: while boys were generally more exposed, girls who endorsed corporal punishment in pro-corporal peer contexts faced sharply elevated risks. Associations varied across countries, with the strongest effects in Kenya.\n\nConclusion: The findings highlight adolescents and peers as overlooked but critical drivers of school violence. Prevention strategies must therefore extend beyond legal bans and teacher training to also shift adolescent attitudes, peer climates, and home–school linkages. Evidence from interventions such as the Good School Toolkit (Uganda), Green Dot bystander program (U.S.), and SASA! (Uganda) demonstrates that norms change is possible. Adapting such models to address corporal punishment could provide a sustainable pathway to safer schools across Africa.",

Using a case study approach, the research highlights how early adoption of search engine optimization (SEO) enabled rapid growth, but also how structural vulnerabilities, shifting digital algorithms, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted platform stability. The findings show that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in agriculture face unique barriers to sustaining online presence, including limited resources, technological dependence, and competitive asymmetries compared to larger players. By situating these experiences within broader academic debates on digital marketing, platform economies, and rural development, the study contributes to understanding the systemic inequalities embedded in digital commerce.

Unlike most research on digital trade which focuses on large platforms or macroeconomic policy, this study examines the practical barriers facing small, mission-driven ventures operating under resource constraints. Drawing on firsthand experience and qualitative documentation from 2017 to 2024, the paper identifies six core challenges: digital visibility, buyer trust, regulatory compliance, logistics infrastructure, access to capital, and pandemic-induced market shocks. The findings illustrate that technical innovation alone is insufficient for sustainability in emerging market contexts. Long-term success in agri-tech requires trust-building, inclusive infrastructure, and ecosystem-level coordination.

If all countries had responded like neighboring countries in Asia, half of global deaths could have been prevented. The United States with 1.2 million COVID deaths, 17% of the global total, has one of the highest COVID death rates, more than five times higher than expected from age, income, and temperature and more than six times the rate in Japan, which has more elderly. Five-year age-adjusted COVID death rates in US states vary from 66 to 410 per 100,000 in Non-Hispanic Whites, a six-fold difference. The state’s percentage of Trump votes in 2020 explains 51% of these differences, with death rates 69% higher in high vs low percentage states overall and 225% higher in 2021, the year with the most deaths. Residents of states with more Trump votes have been half as likely to be vaccinated and to practice social distancing. If the US had responded to COVID like Japan, almost a million American lives would have been saved. If all states had responded like the best Blue State, Hawaii, more than 900,000 lives would have been spared. In addition, using death certificate data, we estimate that the prevalence of Long COVID is 2.7 times higher in states with more vs less Trump votes (10.5±2.3% vs 3.8±1.2%). We discuss how three mental traits evolved through natural and sexual selection may help to explain such dysfunctional behavioral responses to life threatening danger: the tendency to form dominance hierarchies, rampant ingroup favoritism, and the often lethal combination of risk taking and overconfidence, especially in males.",

          "abstract": "Aims: Hazardous alcohol consumption represents a substantial threat to public health, particularly for older adults (aged 55 and above), who are more vulnerable to alcohol-related harm. Healthcare professionals play a key role in addressing alcohol consumption, yet little is known about older adults’ attitudes towards these conversations. This study aimed to: 1) examine older adults’ attitudes towards alcohol-related conversations with GPs, practice nurses, district nurses and volunteers; and 2) explore associations between these attitudes and older adults’ socio-demographic characteristics and alcohol consumption.\n\nMethods: A cross-sectional survey (N = 424) was conducted to collect data on socio-demographics, alcohol consumption and attitudes towards alcohol-related conversations. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between personal characteristics and attitudes. \n\nResults: Support for routinely asking about alcohol consumption was highest for GPs (60.4%), followed by practice nurses (55.0%), district nurses (46.7%) and volunteers (17.5%). Older adults aged 75 and older were more likely to view alcohol use as a personal matter and were less likely to initiate conversations with GPs (OR 0.66, CI 0.43–1.00) or district nurses (OR 0.60, CI 0.38–0.94), compared to those younger than 75. High-risk drinkers were more likely to have negative attitudes towards district nurses routinely addressing alcohol consumption (OR 0.54, CI 0.29–0.99). \n\nConclusions: Attitudes towards alcohol-related conversations differ across healthcare professionals, with GPs viewed most favourably and volunteers least. These findings highlight the need for healthcare systems to avoid treating healthcare professionals as interchangeable when addressing alcohol consumption.",

          "abstract": "This paper provides novel empirical evidence that the medium-term relationship between trade liberalization and growth varies substantially with countries’ economic structure. Using a multi-method strategy, I examine per capita income dynamics after tariff reductions in a panel of 161 countries from 1960 to 2019. Baseline local projections reveal a sharp divergence: GDP per capita rises in manufacturer countries following tariff reductions, and notably falls in nonmanufacturers. A local projections difference-in-differences framework strengthens the analysis by accounting for treatment effect heterogeneity and variation in treatment timing. Finally, I study tariff reductions during the WTO-era reform period (1986 to 1994), a policy episode that historical evidence supports as plausibly exogenous, providing complementary evidence that confirms the observed heterogeneity. An exploration of mechanisms using local projections links these patterns to shifts in productivity, capital stocks, and manufacturing shares in GDP, consistent with theoretical expectations. The findings suggest that rising protectionism in manufacturer countries may be harmful, while further liberalization in nonmanufacturers could have unintended consequences.",

          "abstract": "Peer review has long been regarded as a cornerstone of scholarly communication, ensuring high quality and credibility of published research. Although academic journals trace their origins back three centuries, the procedures for evaluating submissions, particularly peer review, have undergone continuous evolvement. Peer review’s formal institutionalization in the mid-20th century represents a significant, yet natural, phase in this ongoing transformation of scholarly communication. By the early 21st century, there emerged an opinion that the conventional model of peer review faces systematic challenges, including inefficiency, bias, and institutional inertia. The study aims to synthesize the evolution, practices, and outcomes of both conventional and innovative peer review models in scholarly publishing. Through a mixed-methods approach combining interpretative literature review and process modeling (Business Process Model and Notation –BPMN), it identifies four frameworks: pre-publication peer review, registered reports, modular publishing, and the Publish-Review-Curate (PRC) model. While the PRC model, which integrates preprints with post-publication review, demonstrates advantages in transparency and accessibility, no single approach emerges as universally ideal. The choice of model depends on disciplinary context, resource availability, and institutional priorities. The analysis underscores the need for adaptable platforms that enable hybrid workflows, balancing rigor with inclusivity. Future research must address empirical gaps in evaluating these innovations, particularly their long-term impact on equity and epistemic norms.",

Understanding caregiver beliefs and everyday practices may help improve communication and service uptake.\n\nMethods: 17 parents from diverse backgrounds across London, England, participated in autophotographic photo-elicitation interviews exploring daily routines. Interview data were analysed using interpretive critical discourse analysis to identify norms and beliefs surrounding children’s weight and weight-related behaviours.\n\nResults: Five discourses were identified: (1) Food at the Centre of Weight; (2) BMI as an Indicator, not a Diagnosis; (3) Homecooked Food as Nourishment; (4) Negotiating Challenges for a “Balanced Diet”; and (5) Activity for Enjoyment and Development – not Health. Parents viewed children’s weight as primarily shaped by food and diet, and rejected BMI as a standalone measure of healthy weight. Dietary practices centred on balancing nourishing homecooking with less nourishing foods, while physical activity was valued for its developmental benefits.\n\nConclusions: Caregiver discourse revealed tensions between everyday norms and dominant public health messaging around children’s weight. In England, communications may be strengthened by acknowledging the limitations of BMI, resisting diet-centric framings, and aligning more closely with caregiver perspectives on food and activity.",

Most segregation metrics, however, rely on aggregate data with arbitrary spatial boundaries. The sensitivity of segregation measures to those boundaries is well theorized but rarely measured. Leveraging modern redistricting software, we simulate millions of alternative Census tract maps that satisfy Census guidelines, compute segregation for each, and recover the full probabilistic distribution of common indices. These simulations yield new estimates of racial segregation across U.S. cities and, crucially, measure the aggregation‑induced variability hidden in conventional estimates. Encouragingly, values calculated with official tract definitions closely track the mean of the simulated distribution, exhibiting only a slight upward bias, and segregation metrics shift modestly across maps—though variability grows in smaller cities. While our findings confirm the practical robustness of Census tracts, our data and software provide a general framework for diagnosing and correcting spatial‑aggregation error in other contexts.",

These were, in turn, yet another manifestation of broader debates on the appropriate role and functions of science and expertise in liberal-democratic policymaking, which have defined a large part of European politics over the past few years. This paper contributes to the research on the politics of expertise by presenting the results of an innovative multi-level mini-public approach, in which citizens from five European countries – France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, and Poland – were asked to discuss and deliberate on questions relating to the place and role of experts in policymaking, scientific information, and communication. The results of these discus- sions not only yield more fine-grained and nuanced evidence on citizens’ attitudes on these topics than currently available via survey research but also allow for the formulation of actionable advice that will be of interest to policymakers at the national as well as EU level.",

          "abstract": "Social media platforms operate globally, yet whether they invest adequately in content moderation to protect users across languages remains unclear. Leveraging newly mandated transparency data under the European Union’s Digital Services Act, we uncover substantial cross-lingual disparities in moderation workforce allocation across platforms, both in language coverage and the number of moderators relative to the volume of user-generated content in each language. While larger platforms such as YouTube and Meta have moderators in many languages, we find that millions of EU-based users on smaller platforms, including Twitter/X, post in languages without any human oversight. Even when languages have at least one moderator, moderator allocation varies widely and disproportionately to content volume, with Twitter/X mainly prioritizing English while YouTube invests proportionally more in other European languages. Across platforms, languages primarily spoken in the ‘Global South’—such as Spanish, Portuguese, and Arabic—consistently receive proportionally fewer moderators than English, ranging from an average of 55% of English’s allocation on YouTube to only 7.5% on Twitter/X. These findings highlight the need for more meaningful and globally inclusive transparency in platform moderation, to ensure that social media users everywhere receive equitable protection from online harms.",

          "abstract": "Problematic climate information affects public support for mitigation policies. Frequently distributed through a powerful coalition of contrarian actors—the climate change counter movement (CCCM)—it undermines scientific evidence to protect vested interests through ongoing promotional campaigns. On social media, image-based climate misinformation often outperforms verified content. Instagram, with its multimodal vernacular, is a crucial platform for climate misinformation research. \nIn this paper, a novel, visual-first exploratory method combines unsupervised machine learning with multimodal critical discourse analysis. I employ a custom computational tool, the ‘Image Machine, to identify dominant visual signatures and discursive themes in a dataset of 15,000 Instagram posts, collected via hashtags representing climate denial discourse.\nCluster analysis reveals a distinct visual signature that represents the branding logics of established contrarian front group, Friends of Science Society (FoS). Through multimodal critical discourse analysis of a visual cluster and representative post case study, this research interrogates the discursive strategies and climate denial rhetoric of FoS that—through deliberate intertextual, multimodal tactics that exploit Instagram’s affordances—aim to confound public climate science knowledge. Findings situate FoS firmly in the role of front group within the denial machine, instrumentally using climate denial as a rhetorical and discursive strategy to support Canada’s fossil fuel interests.\nFunded by fossil interests, FoS exploits signature visuality to solidify contrarian narratives and reinforce its brand. In documenting individuals and organisations implicit in the FoS funding structure, this research contributes to scholarship about the CCCM, as well introduces a novel methodology to ascribe multimodal—particularly, visual—means for detecting problematic climate information.",

          "abstract": "Are policies that contribute to reducing climate vulnerability electorally advantageous? Political science has long studied the politics of carbon dioxide mitigation, but we know less about the political logic of climate impacts. As adaptation lies at the intersection of environmental, social, and disaster policy, its electoral effects are puzzling from a theoretical perspective. We address this gap by studying a program to improve the ability of households to withstand episodes of water scarcity in Mexico City, implemented between presidential cycles. In contrast to conventional forms of social policy, this intervention prioritizes building future resilience instead of immediate material benefits. We take advantage of the means-tested nature of the program to reduce imbalances between treated and control neighbors and estimate a difference-in-differences to evaluate its impact on electoral outcomes. We find that neighborhoods receiving this adaptation policy had, on average, higher levels of support for the party in charge of its implementation at the presidential and gubernatorial levels, compared to similar neighborhoods that did not receive the program. We also posit that reductions in reliance on inadequate water sources are a mechanism that explains this result. Our findings suggest that climate adaptation may be less contentious than mitigation, therefore giving politicians strong incentives to implement them. Moreover, we contribute to the climate politics literature by providing a theoretical framework to understand the political logic of adaptation action, regardless of its specific form or domain.",

          "abstract": "Elite and Ultra High Net Worth (UHNW) philanthropy is widely debated for its social impact, motivations, and consequences - yet much of this discourse relies on assumptions or theoretical critiques that lack a robust empirical base. This scoping review addresses this gap by systematically mapping published empirical research on elite philanthropy to answer a core question: what is actually known, where is evidence strong or weak, and how can future research be better directed? \n\nDrawing on 182 empirical studies identified through comprehensive database searches and citation analysis, this review shows that existing research is geographically skewed towards the United States and the United Kingdom. The findings reveal patterns in research themes, theoretical perspectives, and methodological choices - alongside major gaps, including limited studies in non-Western contexts, consequently failing to explore differing cultural and religious dimensions, and highlights the sparsity of empirical support for widely held critical assumptions. \n\nBy describing what the empirical literature does and does not show, this paper argues for a more globally inclusive, theoretically diverse, and methodologically rigorous research agenda. The review provides scholars and practitioners with an evidence-based foundation to challenge untested claims, develop new theory, and inform more effective philanthropic practice in an era of growing economic inequality and global wealth concentration.\n\nThe paper calls for more research into topics such as the philanthropy of younger entrepreneurs, gender dynamics, the influence of effective altruism, and recent global phenomena - including the impacts of COVID-19, climate change, and technological innovation.",

          "abstract": "This article explores the historical and spatial conditions that necessitated Black ecclesial autonomy in the United States, beginning with Absalom Jones’s appointment as the first Black pastor of a mainstream Christian denomination and culminating in the rise of contemporary Black mega churches. Using the framework of land-use enforcement and religious zoning as outlined in The Evolution of Land-Use Enforcement Related to The Religious Storefront Church Movement (Williams-Peyton, 2019), the article traces how exclusionary zoning, denominational gatekeeping, and intra-racial class tensions shaped the road from Black mainstream denominations to the emergence of storefront churches and their architectural successors. Through historical analysis and visual typology—including Table 2’s storefront church models—this study argues that Black religious space has always been a site of resistance, creativity, and contested legitimacy.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, the article applies Wilson’s Evolution of Information Behavior Modeling (1999) to interpret these spatial and theological adaptations as dynamic responses to information needs. Congregants’ pursuit of sanctified space is framed as information-seeking behavior shaped by environmental, psychological, and social variables. The creation of sovereign pews emerges not only as architectural ingenuity but as informational agency rooted in trauma, resilience, and theological innovation. By situating these ecclesial strategies within a broader information behavior framework, the article bridges urban ministry, LIS theory, and cultural preservation.",

          "abstract": "The necessity of advancing the study of illness narratives written in non-English languages and produced in non-Anglophone contexts, as well as for developing theoretical frameworks that account for the linguistic and cultural specificities of those settings is the argument of this paper. Specifically, it advocates for a linguistically and theoretically grounded approach to illness narratives that engages with the distinctive cultural and social background of Japan.\n\nIt examines how, in countries like Japan—where traditional patriarchal ideologies remain deeply rooted, and where women's speech and eloquence are often culturally devalued and suppressed—the theoretical framework of illness narratives, which centers on the act of \"telling\" as a form of self-expression, patient agency, and meaning-making, may not fully align with the cultural realities of Japanese society. Drawing on published Japanese illness narratives, this study highlights the discrepancies between these narrative theories—largely developed in Anglophone contexts—and the sociocultural conditions in Japan, where women have historically been valued more for their silence and obedience than for their ability to express or articulate their experiences.\n\nAnalysing illness narratives through published works, both fiction and nonfiction, has become a common methodological approach in the medical humanities. However, this practice often presumes that the texts being analysed are written in English. Examined in this study is how established methods of illness narrative analysis may encounter limitations when applied to a Japanese literary text: Mitomerarenu Yamai (1992) by Keiko Yanagisawa. The book is based on the author’s experience of living with an undiagnosed illness and feeling abandoned by the medical system, both as a woman and as a person. The interpretive dissonance that arises when theories developed in Anglophone contexts are applied to narratives shaped by different cultural and linguistic backgrounds is explored. Also reflected in the study is the discomfort that may emerge when researchers translate and present such illness narrative texts as though they were originally written in English without explaining how they were translated.\nUltimately, greater attention to the linguistic, gendered, and cultural dimensions of illness narratives is called for. The argument in this paper is for the inclusion of non-Anglophone perspectives, which have been largely overlooked, in the broader discourse of illness narratives, narrative medicine and the medical humanities.",

A total of 4293 videos on TikTok and 4825 on YouTube were analyzed, along with 277,528 comments, considering metrics of views and interaction. The results show that on YouTube, men received more likes and views, while on TikTok, audience response was more balanced. The participation of women on both platforms also had a differential impact, as the number of women engaging with content on YouTube negatively correlated with interaction levels, whereas on TikTok, their impact was slightly positive. In conclusion, TikTok emerges as a more inclusive space for scientific communication, though structural challenges remain on both platforms, encouraging further research into strategies that promote gender equity in online science communication.",

          "abstract": "Over the last ten years, the broad field examining information disorder has generated a plethora of research by leveraging the strengths of its interdisciplinary nature. However, interdisciplinary fields also experience challenges including competing and incompatible theoretical orientations. This study uses two dominant orientations in the field that take technological (i.e., Shannon-Weaver model) or social (i.e., pragmatics) approaches to deception as guiding theories to inform theoretical codes for a deductive qualitative analysis and pattern matching approach. The thematic codes are applied to a systematic interdisciplinary sample of information disorder studies articles from 2010-2021 identified by Broda and Strömbäck’s meta-synthesis. The findings indicate that a significant proportion of the sample is moving towards an integrated consideration of intentional and unintentional deception by including both technological and social components. Specifically, techno-centric approaches are moving towards including contexts of message providers or receivers in their models. These combined approaches that consider both context of individuals and technological components of message transmission do not adhere to either of the theoretical perspectives examined. Future research should formally integrate the competing assumptions in technological and social models of information disorder to better align with the literature. These methods contribute to the assessment and refinement of the dominant approaches to information disorder as well as identifying gaps for future research. Specifically, there are many ways the sample operationalizes each model component. There is not a “correct” way to measure each component but future research is needed to assess if each operationalization is measuring the same construct. Further, there are model components that are underrepresented in the sample (i.e., neurocognitive and eco-temporal context) and should be addressed by future research.",

          "abstract": "Despite the amount of research on the topic, there are few direct measurements of partisan segregation in media use. Instead, indirect evidence, like coefficients in multiple regression models, is typically used to indicate the presence or (more typically) absence of partisan segregation. The few methods that do approximate a direct measure require dichotomizing partisanship of people and sources, which is problematic in the United States and unworkable in many other democracies. I suggest using a method originally designed to measure residential segregation to quantify the amount of balkanization in media use at the country, party, and individual levels. To show the potential of the measure, I use data from a nationally representative survey to describe the amount of partisan segregation in media consumption in the United States.",

          "abstract": "Research on inequalities in children’s services in the UK highlights a lack of systematic data on parental demographics, obstructing analysis of structural factors influencing children’s outcomes. Using Growing Up in Scotland, a nationally representative longitudinal child cohort study of children born in 2004-05, we investigate social inequalities in social work contact for children living with parental domestic violence and abuse (working sample n:3216). Using logit models, we examine associations between self-reported maternal experiences of domestic violence and abuse (when children were aged 0-6 years old), and social work service contact for study-children (across ages 2-7 years old), controlling for socio-demographic factors, illicit substance use, alcohol consumption, parental separation, and maternal mental health. Maternal reports of domestic violence and abuse significantly increased the likelihood of social worker contact for the study-child. Social worker involvement was far more likely in low-income households. Where domestic violence and abuse had been reported, social worker contact was twice as likely for boys than for girls. Findings suggest significant socio-economic disparities and gender discrepancies in the social work service response in the context of domestic violence and abuse. These patterns raise concerns about the potential for social work engagement being stratified by socio-economic status and under-identification of girls’ needs in domestic violence and abuse contexts.",

This paper examines how shifts in the racial and ethnic composition of city councils influence land use and housing development, particularly in relation to decision-making diversity. Using data on city council elections and the distribution of new housing permits, I identify the causal effect of electing a minority representative on housing supply. The findings reveal that minority representation increases single-family housing construction at the expense of multi-family housing, challenging conventional expectations about ideology and race. Qualitative interviews with city council members suggest that efforts to address minority underrepresentation drive active support for single-family housing, while distrust of developers—rooted in fears of gentrification—fuels skepticism toward multi-family projects. Overall, the study presents a nuanced view of racial representation: while minorities achieve better representational outcomes, these gains can come with costs.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes a dynamic equilibrium framework that reinterprets persistent macroeconomic issues—global imbalances, long-run deflation or entrenched inequality—not as market failures, but as structural outcomes. Departing from standard nominal‑adjustment models, it incorporates asset‑side mechanisms and reconsiders the transversality condition (TVC), deriving:R_t-ρ=n+D_a-U_(θa)θ/U_c; This balance means the divergence between asset returns (R_t) and time preference (ρ) is sustained by the balance of capital diffusion (D_a), population growth (n) and preference terms (U_(θa)θ/U_c). As result, equilibrium arises from structural and institutional interplay beyond a price‑clearing mechanism. The framework redefines the TVC as a structural condition on asset dissipation and valuation, explaining steady states with persistent differences in asset levels, allocation, or income distribution. By reframing disequilibrium as endogenous optimization outcomes, it offers a basis for analyzing macroeconomic dynamics and designing pragmatic policy tools—for example, Structural Selection of the Steady State, Policy Control of Capital Flows, Asset Dynamics–Based Policy Reconstruction and so on—. In this way, economics may better reflect the realities of economic societies and confront structural challenges.",

For example, a person deciding which of two immigrants is more worthy of admission to a country might weigh the prospective immigrants' education, age, country of origin, and employment history. Conjoint experiments have rapidly generated new insight into these multidimensional choices. By independently randomizing the attributes of a pair of fictitious profiles, researchers summarize the average contribution that each attribute makes to an overall choice. But what if the effect of one attribute depends on the values of other attributes? We present a method that uses data-adaptive experimentation to search for heterogeneity in the effect of one focal attribute as a function of all other attributes. Our empirical application of this method shows that U.S. adults weigh the education of an immigrant much more heavily for certain immigrants than for others. By targeting the heterogeneous effects of a focal attribute, our approach complements conjoint designs that target the average effects of all attributes.",

          "abstract": "Master’s thesis submitted to Jagiellonian University (CEERES Erasmus Mundus MA Program), 2025. \n\nIn contemporary Poland, the politics of memory have emerged as a key site of national identity formation and political legitimacy. The Law and Justice Party (PiS) has emerged as a pivotal political force in shaping historical narratives, rendering collective memory a tool of governance, a means of exclusion, and a device for populist mobilisation. While attempts to post-communist European memory politics have continued to rise, comparative, digital, and discourse analyses of how mnemonic narratives evolve within the same political party over time remain rare. This thesis examines how PiS has served as a \"mnemonic warrior\" during the 2015 and 2023 election campaigns by analysing how narratives of victimhood, betrayal, and national purity are constructed, reinterpreted, and disseminated through both traditional and new media. Using a mixed-methods design combining Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) and Digital Ethnography, the study examines party manifestos, media coverage, and social media accounts. The research employs the Discourse-Historical Approach to CDA and uses tools such as 4CAT and Zeeschuimer for gathering and analysing online material. Through examination, clear consistency in PiS's practices of memory is identifiable, and these hinge upon selective victimhood, elite delegitimisation, and historical revisionism. But the 2023 campaign demonstrates an intensification of digital approaches, particularly on X (formerly Twitter), where previous stories are re-authored in emotive, moralising, and exclusionary narratives aimed at constructing a closed memory community. The study contributes to the understanding of right-wing populist actors weaponising memory to advance polarisation and suppress pluralism. It highlights the necessity of temporally comparative and interdisciplinary study of memory politics, particularly in relation to increasing influence.",

          "abstract": "Nonstandard work schedules (NSWS) among mothers have been linked to negative outcomes in children, yet less research studies have examined the mechanisms underlying this association. To date no research has explored the mechanisms that directly influence children’s cognitive and social-emotional development. Using data from the UK-based Millennium Cohort Study (MCS), we examine the relationship between maternal work schedules and children’s social-emotional development from ages three to seven, focusing on three potential mediators: the stability of children’s daily routines, the types of their daily activities, and maternal depression. We find that maternal NSWS is associated with increased social-emotional difficulties in children, particularly when mothers work at night. Among the three mechanisms, maternal depression emerges as the most significant mediator, followed by regular bedtime routines. These findings suggest that while daily routines and activities are important for child development, a substantial portion of the impact of maternal NSWS is mediated through maternal psychological well-being. Effective interventions to support children’s social-emotional development should consider the mental health and well-being of mothers working nonstandard hours.",

Our analysis supports the clinical utility, economic sustainability, and feasibility of pre-emptive PGx testing. However, key barriers persist, including limited real-world data, unclear reimbursement mechanisms, insufficient laboratory and IT infrastructure, poor clinician training, and patient concerns related to privacy and data protection. To address these challenges, we propose strategic actions across six areas: regulatory alignment, research investment, professional training and result interpretation, public awareness and consent, laboratory infrastructure, and IT systems and data governance.",

          "abstract": "The study of segregation in activity spaces is experiencing renewed attention, fueled by the \nincreasing availability of mobility data from mobile phones and social media. These new data \nsources allow for high-resolution analysis of how people move through cities and interact \nacross diverse neighborhoods. A key goal behind this work is to inform the design of \ninclusive spaces that foster intergroup contact and social cohesion. However, much of this \nresearch has focused on statistical diversity (typically measured through census data, \nmobility traces, or indices that capture the distribution and co-presence of social groups) \nwhile giving less consideration to how diversity is perceived by those who use these spaces.\nThis study bridges that gap by combining GIS-based mobility modeling with on-street survey \ndata. Using aggregated mobility data from ~90,000 mobile phone users in Auckland, New \nZealand, we estimated ethnic mobility flows and computed spatial diversity indices for \nresidents and visitors across six neighborhoods. In parallel, we conducted 249 on-street \nsurveys in those neighborhoods to capture perceptions of diversity.\nOur findings reveal only a weak correlation between statistical and perceived diversity, \nhighlighting that individuals do not simply mirror demographic compositions in their \nperceptions. Instead, perceived diversity is more strongly predicted by self-reported \nintergroup contact (both within the specific neighborhood and across the city) and by \naffective factors such as space affinity and attitudes toward outgroup members. These \nresults underscore the importance of integrating both statistical and perceptual data to \nunderstand diversity in urban environments. Designing for inclusion, we argue, must \naccount for both who is present in a space and how that space is experienced.",

          "authors": "Juan Pereira",
          "abstract": "This paper examines parental narcissism as a mechanism of social reproduction, focusing on how emotional control is transmitted across generations within family systems. Moving beyond individual pathology, the analysis situates narcissistic parenting in broader sociological frameworks that include Bourdieu’s concepts of habitus and capital, Foucault’s theories of discipline and biopower, and feminist scholarship on gendered emotional labor. The study argues that parental narcissism constitutes a form of “emotional capital,” whereby children internalize patterns of control, surveillance, and conditional validation that shape their adult relationships, institutional participation, and social positioning.\nThe paper traces the historical emergence of narcissistic family structures within the rise of the nuclear family, capitalist economies, and gendered divisions of labor, showing how these contexts intensify parental strategies of emotional governance. It highlights how mechanisms such as gaslighting, triangulation, and conditional acceptance become embedded as durable dispositions—what may be termed an “emotional habitus”—that reproduce hierarchical social orders.\nAttention is given to the intersections of class, gender, and culture in shaping narcissistic parenting strategies, as well as to sites of resistance where children and adults develop counter-strategies against domination. Contemporary digital platforms and shifting family forms are also considered as new arenas of emotional control and reproduction.\nThe findings suggest that parental narcissism should be understood as a systemic social process with lasting implications for inequality, institutional reproduction, and emotional well-being, calling for both therapeutic and policy interventions that address its structural roots.",

As much of relevant data is now in the hands of the private sector, governments increasingly resort to purchasing data from private sources. There is, however, scant empirical evidence and a lack of understanding of how governments go about data purchasing. Therefore, we develop a new conceptual-analytical framework to analyze three models of data purchasing by governments: purchasing raw or aggregated data, data analyses, and data-based services. Next, based on Dutch data purchases, we explore the utility of our framework and create an evidence base detailing what data, data analyses, and data-based services Dutch governments purchase from whom, how, and for what purposes in the context of societal challenges. Our results map buyers and sellers of data in the Dutch context, as well as the types of data sold and in which policy domains. We expose a serious lack of transparency in government reporting on data purchasing. We further discuss our results in view of possible archetypes of data purchases and what purchasing strategy implications they have.

Building on comparative welfare state research and inspired by research on stratified reproduction, we examine regulatory provisions towards abortion, contraception and medically assisted reproduction, empirically mapping the institutional landscape for 30 countries between 1995 and 2020. We propose a conceptual framework of ‘reproductive equity support’, defined as the sum of statutory permitted and resourced reproductive options, which varies across four ideal types: conservative, paternalistic, libertarian and comprehensive. Second, we operationalize permissiveness and generosity for contraception, abortion and medically assisted reproduction using policy indicators from the novel International Reproduction Policy Database. We find strong variation between countries, and substantive shifts over time: while most countries make a leap towards more permissive reproduction policy, increase in generosity is less pronounced and less wide-spread.",

In the policy debate much hope is placed on the potential of pre-schools to remedy this, by providing a learning and language environment that can compensate for the disadvantages that these children face. \n\nWe study inequalities in pre-school learning contexts by immigrant origin, using full population register data that matches all children to their families and pre-schools. Enrolment in pre-school is lower for children of immigrants, but this is – surprisingly – almost entirely driven by low enrolment of children in non-refugee families. Contrary to expectations, children from origin groups with larger school difficulties have high pre-school enrolment rates. Our results suggest that explanations for low enrolment should primarily be sought in intentions to remain long-term in the host country.\n\nIn pre-schools, immigrant background children have a somewhat higher teacher density, but a somewhat lower density of qualified teachers, and a somewhat higher turnover rate and sickness absence among teachers. These differences are however small. Where we see large differences is in the composition of the child and teacher group: Immigrant-background children go to pre-schools where a much higher proportion of teachers and children have immigrant background. \n\nWe conclude that hopes to equalize school outcomes through encouraging pre-school enrolment are misplaced, and equalizing structural indicators is unlikely to make a big difference. The compensatory potential of pre-schools lies primarily in a de-segregation of staff and children across pre-schools.",

It also examines the social reasons and identity concerns that result in variation in code-mixing practices among male and female students. The attitudes of students towards code-mixing and the perception of others’ use of it have also been examined. The research reveals that code-mixing practices vary significantly between males and females due to gender differences in identity and students’ responses to social pressure and opportunity at university. Female students mix languages more frequently and in more sophisticated ways because they aspire to be socially accepted and project a modern identity. Male students, on the other hand, employ code-mixing in a more functional way, using it to exhibit academic expertise and professional standing. Overall, the research reveals that mixing English and Bangla is not the same for all people; it is a finely tuned strategy that exhibits gender differences in identity and students’ negotiation with social pressure and opportunity at university.",

          "abstract": "Farmers increasingly use videos and other digital tools to access and share farming information. However, women in agriculture have commonly been excluded from influencing and accessing these digital tools. Rigorous evaluations have found that including women farmers in the creation and screening of farming videos can benefit women through improved productivity and decision-making power. But what is needed for extension workers to make these videos accessible to women farmers outside of carefully managed pilots? We implemented a randomized controlled trial testing how the gender of farmers featured in wheat farming advisory videos influenced how much, and with whom, 294 extension workers shared these videos in rural Bihar. We interpreted results through twenty follow-up interviews and the ‘Mechanisms and Conditions’ framework based in affordance theory. We found the extent to which extension workers shared videos with women farmers hinged on extension workers' perceptions, material resources, and cultural contexts, rather than the gender of farmers featured in videos. From a theoretical perspective, this core finding suggests the 'Mechanisms and Conditions' framework requires modification to account for material resource access when explaining technology use. From a practical perspective, the core finding prompts practitioners to ask ‘how might extension systems circulating digital tools be more inclusive?’, not just ‘how might we adapt digital tools to be more inclusive?’. This systems-level approach to empowering women in agricultural innovation systems could involve supporting inclusive person-to-person extension networks, and avoiding dependence on smartphone-based extension systems, like YouTube and chatbots.",

          "authors": "Panos FITSILIS",
          "abstract": "Academic department rankings often overlook the rich evidence in students’ open-ended comments, relying instead on questionnaires, reputation, and research metrics. This paper introduces the PULSE Index (Perceived University Learning &amp; Student Experience), a 0 - 100 composite score that converts student comments into department-level indicators using a transparent AI/NLP pipeline. The method is student-centered by design. Stage 1 defines a set of student-valued categories (e.g., teaching, infrastructure, services) and elicits their weights via a multi-criteria procedure. Stage 2 collects and de-identifies comments, assigns each comment to categories with aspect-based classification, and estimates neutral-aware sentiment using modern embeddings. Topic models (LDA/BERTopic) provide an empirical check on the category map and surface emergent themes. For each module and category, we compute conditional mean sentiment, coverage and intensity; apply empirical-Bayes shrinkage to stabilize small samples; and, optionally, fold salience and strength into a representativeness factor. Stage 3 normalizes indicators within peer groups, forms module composites via the elicited weights, and aggregates modules to departments using reliability- and volume-aware weights, before scaling to the 0 - 100 PULSE Index. Robustness is assessed through sensitivity analysis (weights, normalization), bootstrap confidence intervals and rank-stability; fairness diagnostics examine subgroup patterns (e.g., level, modality, language). The framework yields explainable, auditable scores with traceable contributions by category and exemplary comments, supporting both accountability and improvement. By operationalizing student voice with methodological safeguards, the PULSE Index offers a rigorous alternative to traditional department rankings and a practical blueprint for institutions seeking evidence-based, student-centered quality assurance. An illustrative worked example demonstrates implementation details and reporting.",

          "abstract": "Social scientists have developed dozens of measures for assessing partisan bias in redistricting. But these measures are not easily adapted to other groups, including groups defined by race, class, or geography. Nor are they applicable to single- or no-party contexts, such as local redistricting. To overcome these limitations, we propose a unified framework of harm for evaluating the impacts of a districting plan on individual voters and the groups to which they belong. We consider a voter harmed if their chosen candidate is not elected under the current plan, but would be under a different plan. Harm improves on existing measures by both focusing on the choices of individual voters and directly incorporating counterfactual plans. We discuss strategies for estimating harm, and demonstrate the utility of our framework through analyses of partisan gerrymandering in New Jersey, voting rights litigation in Alabama, and racial dynamics of Boston City Council elections.",

We first highlight the diverse and evolving usage of the concept of militarism over time and across different knowledge forms. From there we move on to examine key tensions within IR accounts, suggesting that ‘historical,’ ‘scientific,’ and ‘political’ approaches stand to gain from a more rigorous engagement with each other. We conclude with an appeal for sustained attention to militarism as concept and its historical and political dimensions in particular.",

This is done through a systematic review, mostly in the form of a narrative review and with statistical indicators that are synthesized. A graphical summary (evidence gap map) is provided to better identify the nature of evidence available. There is a wide range of evidence on Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland and their integration, although substantive and systematic gaps remain. The review provides a brief historical background, looks at the demographic composition of Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland, discusses economic integration, housing, education, social integration, crime and safety, health and well-being, and attitudes to Ukrainian refugees. The demographic profile of Ukrainian refugees (many women, many children and elderly people, highly educated) is well documents, as are challenges to economic integration. Much less is known about cultural integration and political participation, for example. Given the size of the population and the ongoing war in Ukraine, more research on Ukrainian refugees is warranted, particularly in the direction of successful integration in a context where return in the near future seems increasingly unlikely --- although so-called dual-intent remains the official focus ---, and in areas beyond economic integration that affect well-being and intentions to return.",

This paper proposes that political interest can in part be explained by the meaning that people find in politics. Evidence from six experiments (n=5,767) shows that appealing to meaning can increase political interest. In these studies, treated participants provide information about what they find meaningful in their lives, with their responses leveraged in on-the-fly treatments that connect their responses to politics. These treatments lead people otherwise disinterested in politics and policy to become more interested in both. The effects of meaning on interest are sizable, equivalent to 43.1% of the pre-treatment divide in political interest between strong and non-strong partisans and 61.1% of the divide between those with and without college degrees. These results offer a new way of understanding---and increasing---political interest.",

          "abstract": "Rough sets, rough set-theoretic definitions and axiomatic frameworks have been, for some time now, a mainstream mathematical approach from fuzzy mathematics to model and encode (un)certainty in traditional information systems across different domains. With the pervasive rise and shift from traditional information systems to Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based intelligent information systems, however, the issue of representing and encoding (un)certain knowledge of different domains and at different levels of abstraction within such systems has emerged as an unsolved pivotal research problem in AI. The paper is interdisciplinary in nature, being positioned at the intersection of mathematics and AI research, and, to that end, will have two objectives. First, it will focus on critically reviewing key state-of-the-art interdisciplinary research literature on how rough sets and rough set-theoretic frameworks are being employed for (un)certain knowledge representation, e.g., via ontologies and Knowledge Graphs, in AI-based information systems across different domains. Second, based on the aforementioned critical review, it will elucidate research implications and potential research strategies which will inform future research towards developing an integrated mathematical philosophy and mathematico-logical formalism for (un)certain knowledge representation in AI systems.",

          "authors": "Nerhum Sandambi",
          "abstract": "Many countries develop through the increase of their economic resources, which naturally exist in most countries. On the other hand, some evidence shows that countries can develop through fiscal decentralisation, which promotes this growth through regional growth via significantly viable economic transformation. In Africa, for example, federalist countries such as Nigeria and South Africa show greater capacity for regional transformation through indicators of great relevance in themselves. Evidence also shows, for example, greater economic transformation through fiscal federalism. South Africa, for example, has less significant decentralisation but greater capacity to collect tax revenues. The analysis shows that Nigeria, for example, has a fiscal base in only a few states, with 10 states naturally having greater capacity for economic transformation, which suggests that there is less complexity in tax revenue collection, thus restricting economic development particularly in these states. Political decentralisation in African federalist countries does in fact lead to greater political turnover and greater political plurality among its political actors, which are naturally the political parties. Although there is de facto fiscal decentralisation, particularly in Nigeria and Ethiopia, there is nevertheless a greater lack of economic development in all territories, with the exception, for example, of states with greater economic concentration such as Lagos and Abuja.",

Two third-party data scrapers on Apify were used to obtain a large sample of TikToks (n=3,506) scraped using contraception-related search terms and hashtags. These videos were screened for eligibility, and we used a hybrid deductive and inductive thematic approach to analyze eligible videos (n=712). A youth advisory committee was formed to guide and interpret the research. Central themes include contrasts between user experiences of side effects and clinical evidence, anti-hormonal sentiment, empowerment, and trust/mistrust in healthcare.

          "abstract": "While micro-level research shows that employed individuals are less likely to experience poverty, macro-level trends reveal disappointing poverty reduction despite substantial employment growth across European countries – constituting an employment-poverty paradox. This study addresses this paradox by examining the heterogeneous effects of employment on poverty across different family types, while rigorously accounting for selection processes and confounding through leveraging panel data, varying assumption about causal structure, simulations, and formal sensitivity analysis. We apply a multi-group Kitagawa-Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition to examine how employment prevalences and premiums contribute to poverty differences across varying family-types. Our results suggest that differences in employment prevalences contribute minimally to poverty gaps, while premium effects drive most observable effects. Part-time employment shows even weaker poverty reduction effects across all family types. Sensitivity analysis reveals vulnerability to unmeasured confounding, suggesting true causal effects may be smaller still. In sum, employment is not a panacea for poverty reduction across family types.",

While existing literature has documented a purported increasing trend of these themes, investigations that consider the social conditions during song production remain scarce. By analyzing 26,438 rap singles released in the United States from 1990 to 2015, we find that the prevalence of these lyrical themes does not show a consistent upward trajectory. Instead, they exhibit significant temporal fluctuations, with each following a distinct pattern. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a strong contemporaneous correlation between these lyrical fluctuations and their corresponding national social indicators, including rates for crime, sexual assault, poverty, and DEA arrests. Crucially, this correlation becomes significantly stronger when using social statistics specific to Black Americans. These findings provide large-scale empirical evidence that art is a sensitive reflection of the social and economic realities of the time, offering insights into how deep-seated social problems are depicted through artistic expression.",

          "authors": "Selçuk Bedük; Anna Yong",
          "abstract": "While any experience of child poverty can affect life chances, longer exposure is particularly concerning due to its lasting effects on education, health and earnings. This study adopts a life-course perspective, tracking poverty from birth to age 10 for cohorts born in Britain between 1991 and 2017. On average, 17% of children spent at least half of their childhood in poverty. Long-term poverty affected 25% of those born in the early 1990s, markedly declined to 13-14% for cohorts born after the 1997 welfare reforms, and substantially increased again to 23% for children born following the 2013 austerity reforms. Decomposition analysis shows that cross-cohort changes are driven more by shifts in the penalties associated with work and family risk factors than by changes in their prevalence. These shifts in penalties reflect broader changes in redistribution and predistribution. The early decline in long-term poverty was largely due to rising employment and earnings in low-income households, while the post-austerity increase stems mainly from reduced redistribution. For cohorts born in the 2000s, social transfers played a substantial role in containing long-term poverty despite worsening predistribution. Overall, the findings show that long-term childhood poverty remains a significant challenge in Britain and highlight the need for both stronger redistribution and improved predistribution to address it.",

Informed by a dualistic understanding of scale as both fixed and socially constructed, the commentary firstly argues for comparing and contrasting the influence of different national research evaluation systems on geographical knowledge production. Secondly, the contribution conceives of research evaluation systems as a form of scalar politics which enables a view of the actors and networks contesting current evaluation systems and promoting alternatives.

The present study is a descriptive-analytical \ninvestigation of the selected speeches of political discourse given by the two most \ninfluential speakers of Animal Farm (Old Major and Squealer), a novel written by \nOrwell (1945). To investigate and uncover the ways in which ideology and power \nrelations are subtly reproduced in discourse, we have examined what makes Old Major \nand Squealer persuasive in the expression of their ideologies. The analysis is grounded \non the main tenets and principles of Critical Discourse Analysis. Unlike any other forms \nof linguistic analysis, the main purpose of CDA is explicitly socio-political, since it \nseeks to better represent the role of discourse in the reproduction of dominance and \npower struggle. Therefore, we have adopted Fairclough’s three-dimensional framework: \ndescription, interpretation and explanation. In addition, we have capitalized on \nAristotle’s approach of persuasion (ethos, pathos and logos) to be as a supporting \nanalytical tool of linguistic and rhetorical devices. Thus, the analytical part of this \nresearch work has analyzed the possible interrelatedness of textual properties and their \nconveyance of a particular ideology by giving it an eclectic treatment as far as the \napplication of framework is concerned. The findings of this investigation uncover the \nlinguistic and rhetorical techniques that contribute to the overall process of persuasion, \nwhich have different ideological attachments. The study concludes that the analysis of \nFairclough’s three dimensional framework and three modes of persuasion under the \nmain tenets of CDA has shown that politicians – even in a fictional political world – \ndepend significantly on linguistic manipulation to demonstrate ideologies, steer people’s \nthoughts, manufacture consent and rise to power.",

          "authors": "martina mchenga",
          "abstract": "Abstract\nPurpose: Corporal punishment in schools remains pervasive across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) despite legal prohibitions. While research has examined prevalence and teacher attitudes, little is known about how adolescents’ own beliefs and peer normative environments influence their vulnerability to teacher violence.\nMethods: The study analysed nationally representative Violence Against Children Surveys (VACS) from five SSA countries (Eswatini 2021, Mozambique 2019, Kenya 2019, Namibia 2019, Lesotho 2018), focusing on school-going adolescents aged 13-17 years (N=10,904). Logistic regression models estimated associations between adolescents’ individual endorsement of corporal punishment, peer-level attitudes and self-reported experience of teacher corporal punishment in the past year. Models were adjusted for socio-demographic and household covariates. Country-specific estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.\nResults: Overall, 13.6% of adolescents reported teacher physical punishment in the past year. More than half (52.8%) endorsed corporal punishment, and peer endorsement averaged 53%. In pooled models, adolescents who endorsed corporal punishment had twice the odds of reporting teacher violence (aOR=2.1, 95% CI: 1.6-2.7). Each 10-percentage-point increase in peer endorsement was associated with a 10% increase in odds (aOR=1.1, 95% CI: 1.0-1.2). Girls and adolescents in secondary school were less likely to report teacher punishment, while those exposed to corporal punishment at home were over three times more likely to also report it at school (aOR=3.4, 95% CI: 2.5-4.7). Heterogeneity across countries was high, with strongest associations observed in Kenya.\nConclusions: Adolescents’ own beliefs and peer normative climates significantly shape their risk of teacher violence. Prevention strategies must extend beyond legal bans and teacher training to also target adolescent attitudes, peer environments, and home-school linkages. Interventions combining school-wide norms change, peer engagement, and parenting support may offer the most sustainable pathway to eliminating corporal punishment in schools",

This study examines student perceptions at a private high school that implemented a zero-access phone ban during the 2024–2025 school year. Two anonymous surveys were fielded at policy launch (October 2024) and three months later (January 2025), yielding a combined N = 494. Primary outcomes were perceived changes in in-person interaction frequency and quality, perceived connectedness, perceived classroom focus, perceived productivity during school, and self-reported academic performance. Most respondents perceived social benefits, including more frequent face-to-face conversations, while a minority reported diminished connectedness. Nearly half perceived higher productivity during school, yet most perceived no change in academic performance. Over half reported increased phone use during homework, which may offset in-school gains. Findings underscore heterogeneity in responses and suggest that bans, without complementary supports, can improve opportunities for in-person interaction for many students but may disadvantage students who rely on digital scaffolds for social engagement.",

          "abstract": "This deliverable set out to analyse the context-specificity of financial support policies for families with children and (out-of-pocket fees for) childcare services, two policy areas that feature prominently in rEUsilience recommendations (Daly et al., 2025). Our first question was to what extent child-contingent benefits compensate for the out-of-pocket costs of formal childcare services at different income levels. Based on our newly introduced compensation ratio measure, we showed that the combination of child contingent benefits and out-of-pocket costs tends to be low-income targeted, in the sense that lower-income families pay lower fees for childcare and/or receive higher benefits. In Poland and Sweden, the out-of-pocket expenses for childcare tended to be lower (on average) across the income distribution than child-contingent benefits, whereas high-income families in Belgium and Spain paid more for childcare than they received as financial support. Secondly, we asked to what extent child-contingent benefits compensate for the out-of-pocket costs of formal childcare services for different family types. Here, we found that generally (with the exception of Spain) families with more children receive higher child-contingent benefits relative to their out-of-pocket costs for childcare, compared to families with fewer children. In all the four countries studied here, single-parent families receive higher child-contingent benefits relative to their out-of-pocket costs for childcare, compared to two-parent families. Finally, we asked to what extent child-contingent benefits compensate for the out-of-pocket costs of formal childcare services when families transition into work. Here, we found that, generally, the compensation ratio was higher for families on social assistance or employment at low wages, compared to families working at higher wages. This holds for single-parent families (with the exception of Poland) as well as two-parent families. Moreover, the extent to which the compensation rate was lowered with employment and at higher wage levels differed between countries, with the drop particularly notable in Belgium and moderate to absent in Poland. For average wage employees, the compensation ratio was lowest in Belgium compared to the other countries included here.",

          "title": "The Algorithm's Guide to Tourism: Simulating Generative AI's Impact on the US Domestic Tourist Flow Network",
          "authors": "Seonjin Lee; Lori Pennington-Gray",
          "abstract": "This study examines the potential impact of large language models (LLMs) on tourist flow using scenario-based projection models. We simulate one million US residents’ domestic travel decisions using two different LLMs, Gemini 2.5 Flash and GPT 4.1 Nano. The LLM-based projections are compared to the null model and empirical-based simulations to assess characteristics of tourist flows generated by LLMs. LLMs generate tourist flows that are more seasonal, more concentrated in a few popular destinations, and less reciprocal than empirical-based simulations. Other patterns, like the mean resilience index and the mean travel distance, vary by LLM used. These findings show that the widespread adoption of LLMs can undermine the sustainability and resilience of tourism systems. As such, we urge tourism scholars and practitioners to proactively assess the consequences of adopting LLMs in tourism to ensure the sustainability and resilience of tourism systems.",

          "title": "Indentured Replacement Theory of Credential Inflation, Revisited (2000-2025)",
          "authors": "Joseph Sharpe",
          "abstract": "U.S. higher education operates as a mechanism of economic control, organized around the dynamics of replacement, credential inflation, and indenture. This paper revisits and updates the 2000 “Indentured Replacement Theory of Credential Inflation” that first argued this case, adding a 2024 lens on endowment capture. A descriptive synthesis of public data series reveals the scale of this control: student-loan balances stand at roughly $1.64 trillion with 90+ day delinquency near 10.2% (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 2025); meanwhile, institutional endowments total $873.7 billion\nwith $30 billion in annual spending (NACUBO/Commonfund, 2025). Evidence on “degree reset” is mixed, and post-pause repayment frictions elevate delinquency risk. Policy developments in 2023–2025 increase scrutiny of institutional finances while providing limited direct borrower relief. The paper concludes by proposing structural, cultural, and market-facing remedies, evaluated by a simple test: does a given policy loosen—or tighten—the binding effects of debt on life chances?",

          "authors": "Nandil Bhatia; Wei Cai; Sameer Srivastava",
          "abstract": "In evaluative contexts, evaluatees typically seek to present themselves in a favorable light, while evaluators ask penetrating questions to assess these claims. Here we develop a framework to identify curveball questions: ones that are on-topic yet perplexing (i.e., difficult to predict) relative to prior statements. We develop a language-based measure of curveball questions and apply it to a corpus of quarterly earnings calls. After validating this question-level measure, we next demonstrate that a call-level curveball measure predicts absolute returns, absolute abnormal returns, and changes in a firm’s average analyst rating. Finally, we identify the types of analysts who are most likely to pose curveball\nquestions, the types of firms that are most likely to receive them, and the conditions under which they tend to arise.",
