          "abstract": "Transparent and reproducible science requires that data and code underlying published results be made available to allow regeneration and verification of the results. But how easy is it to reproduce computational analyses using these materials? This technical report describes efforts to computationally reproduce results at one established repository as part of a routine internal pre-publication review. We conduct a structured content analysis of twenty-six “author reports'' generated through a standard review process and categorize identified issues. We find that four in five studies include code errors that prevent execution or produce inconsistent results. Although these errors are generally minor, we interpret our findings to indicate that review and correction can help resolve many of the errors and facilitate computational reproducibility.",

          "authors": "Saoirse Connor Desai; Winston Tan; Alexander Burchett; Kirsten Barnes; Louise Sharpe; Ben Colagiuri",
          "abstract": "Background: Mounting research indicates that observing others experience side effects can induce negative expectations and exacerbate side effects via the nocebo effect. However, most research on these socially-induced nocebo effects has focused on model-observer dyads, which may not map on to many real world settings in which people are exposed to many different models (e.g., social media).\n\nPurpose: To address this, we tested nocebo effects following observation of many models and whether the order of observing a ‘severe’ model (i.e., highly negative experience) moderated this effect.\n\nMethod : One hundred and seventy participants observed five social models undergo a virtual reality (VR) rollercoaster in Zoom, with four reporting mild cybersickness and one reporting severe cybersickness. The position of the model reporting severe cybersickness was manipulated between groups as either first (primacy), middle, or last\n(recency).\n\nResults: Participants who observed the cybersickness modelling reported greater cybersickness when they underwent the VR rollercoaster relative to a control group who observed non-symptomatic models. This social modelling effect was mediated by the participants’ expectancy of cybersickness symptoms. However, the position of the severe model within the sequence did not impact the participants’ cybersickness levels.\n\nConclusions: These findings demonstrate that socially-induced nocebo effects can occur in response to exposure to many models but the order of exposure does not moderate this effect. The results also indicate that developing interventions that target expectancy is critical for reducing the burden of socially-induced nocebo effects.",

          "abstract": "Reading is a complex process shaped by neurobiological traits and environmental factors, with reading disabilities imposing profound impacts on educational and socioeconomic outcomes worldwide. Early intervention is key, but identifying reliable, early-age predictors of future reading development remains a significant challenge, particularly in linguistically and socioeconomically diverse populations. While language-based precursors to reading ability (e.g., phonological awareness) have excellent predictive validity in homogeneous populations (e.g., English monolinguals), performance on these measures can be biased by language and early life experience. Here, we investigate whether visual processing measures could predict reading outcomes without biases of language background and socioeconomic status as early as kindergarten. Across a large and diverse sample of children (N ~ 1400) from California public schools, we administered measures of rapid visual processing (multi-element processing and visual motion perception tasks). Measures of language proficiency, socioeconomic status, and reading ability were also collected. We show that performance on the visual-processing measures did not differ by home language (Spanish versus English) or socioeconomic factors. Visual-processing measures accounted for ~12–18% of variance in year-end reading scores. Feature importance analysis suggests that visual-processing measures are important predictors of risk in kindergarten with equivalent performance to some of the conventional screening measures. Our findings show that visual-processing measures may provide a window into reading development that is agnostic to spoken language proficiency and socioeconomics. Incorporating these visual measures into early screening batteries could enable more equitable identification of children at risk for reading difficulties across diverse populations.",

          "authors": "Jeffrey S Bowers",
          "abstract": "Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) equipped with general learning algorithms, but no linguistic knowledge, can learn to associate words with objects in naturalistic scenes when trained on head-mounted video recordings from a single child’s first-person experience. Similarly, ANNs can master syntax when trained on a similar amount of linguistic data a child experiences in a few years. These findings have been taken to challenge the view that innate linguistic priors play a role in child language acquisition. Here I show that the training environments and learning resources of ANN and humans are poorly matched, and accordingly, conclusions regarding human language priors are not merited. I also review three sets of findings that strongly suggest ANNs are missing human inductive biases: (1) children (but not ANNs) create new well-structured languages when only exposed to degraded ones; (2) ANN (but not humans) learn impossible and possible human languages in similar ways with similar facility; and (3) humans (but not ANNs) show a critical period for language learning. In this last case, adding an “innate” inductive prior to the ANN results in better ANN-human alignment. Just as is the case regarding claims of ANN-human alignment in the domain of vision, conclusions regarding ANN-human alignment in the domain of language is characterized by a lack of severe testing of hypotheses.",

          "abstract": "Self-reported sharing intentions are a common methodological tool in research on social media. It is unclear, however, whether such measures are actually useful indices of on-platform sharing. To shed light on this question, we recruited N=532 users from X (formerly Twitter) who had shared links to either high- or low-quality news outlets and invited them to complete an online survey where they indicated their likelihood of sharing true and false headlines. We find that, relative to participants who shared high-quality news on X, those who shared lower-quality news on X were also more likely to say that they would share false headlines in the survey, and a greater fraction of the headlines they said they would share were false. This suggests that self-reported sharing intentions do provide useful insight into the quality of news actually shared on social media.",

          "authors": "Gaja Jarosz; Cerys Hughes; Andrew Lamont; Brandon Prickett; Maggie Baird; Seoyoung Kim; Max Nelson",
          "abstract": "We examine the joint roles of type frequency and token frequency in three artificial language learning experiments involving lexicalized plural allomorphy. The primary role of type frequency in productivity is well-established, but debates about the precise relationship between type frequency and productivity continue. The effect of token frequency on productivity is even more controversial: some lines of research suggest that token frequency and productivity are inversely related, other results indicate that they are positively related, and yet others argue that token frequency plays no role in productivity.  We take up both of these questions. Our learning framework makes it possible to examine the effects of these variables on generalization to novel forms as well as to examine how sensitivity to these factors affects the time-course of learning. The first two experiments differentiate predictions for generalization of three distinct hypotheses about the role of type frequency, while the third experiment investigates the independent role of token frequency. We find that both type and token frequency independently and positively contribute to learning rates and generalization across the three experiments, with type frequency playing a dominant role. We also apply two computational learning theories - implementing two prominent theoretical linguistic frameworks - to the learning of the lexically-conditioned allomorphy patterns in our experiments. Neither of these models is designed to encode a particular relationship between token frequency, type frequency, and productivity, but we show that both models correctly predict the general trends in generalization rates, learning curves, and the influence of token frequency observed across the experimental conditions.",

          "authors": "Joseph Coffey; Elizabeth Spelke",
          "abstract": "Recent years have seen growing interest in field research using randomized designs to evaluate the impacts of diverse interventions on early child development and education. Measuring these impacts requires assessments that can track development prior to school entry. We propose a novel approach using research from developmental cognitive science: targeting five areas of core knowledge—language, numeracy, spatial reasoning, mental state reasoning, and executive function—that have been found to emerge across cultures in infancy and predict later performance on related skills in adulthood. Using tasks based on experimental paradigms developed in lab settings, we tested 1256 Ghanaian children (centering on four age groups at 1.5, 3.5, 5.5, and 7.5 years), whose parent previously took part in a randomized controlled field experiment on secondary education. Here we investigate the sensitivity and specificity of these tasks. We ask whether these core knowledge tasks 1) produce responses from Ghanaian children that are internally consistent and above chance, 2) relate to performance on other similar tasks within the same cognitive domain, and 3) are stable over time and predict future performance. We find that the assessment battery captures individual differences in the older tested age groups (3.5 years and above), in the domains of language, numeracy, spatial reasoning, and executive functioning, but not for infants or for tests of mental state reasoning. Our findings demonstrate that experimental methods designed to study core knowledge in infancy can be used track individual differences in children’s cognitive development.",

          "abstract": "This study proposes a rigorous method for controlling visual stimulus size in online psychological experiments. Our method employs ruler-based calibration to estimate the millimeter-to-pixel ratio by applying the least squares method to participants’ repeated measurements of randomly generated line segment lengths. Importantly, the success of the calibration can be objectively verified by assessing the measurement error of a test line segment and the residual variance in a linear regression model. Our simulation demonstrated that, with the recommended calibration criteria, an upper bound of the standard deviation for estimation errors was 0.007 mm/px. Implementation results showed that the majority of 100 participants completed the calibration within a few minutes, demonstrating the method’s feasibility. Our method may facilitate rigorous studies of psychological phenomena sensitive to visual stimulus size, such as visual perception and cognition, in online environments.

          "abstract": "To better understand how inconsistent beliefs persist and whether the tendency to endorse them (labeled doublethink) is malleable, we conducted four preregistered studies and a qualitative follow-up (total N = 1320 Serbian participants). We first found that doublethink was independently predicted by both superficial information processing style and lack of ability to spot contradictions. We next tested three progressively more direct interventions to reduce doublethink, all unsuccessful - first one increased sensitivity to contradictions in irrelevant material, second pushed respondents to reconcile pairs of provided inconsistent beliefs; third made them cross-reference their own inconsistent beliefs. When asked to elaborate their inconsistencies in semi-structured interviews, respondents did not evaluate them negatively, instead they employed circumvention strategies - attributing incompatibility to the response format or diluting content of the claims (e.g., adding logical conditions). Although these strategies are not irrational per se, they might enable moral relativization, double standards or incompatible expectations from others.",

          "abstract": "This study evaluated the ability of ChatGPT-4, an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, to generate psychological reports using mock data. Two hundred forty-nine licensed psychologists in the United States, rated the quality of AI-generated and human-generated psychological reports across six dimensions: overall quality, readability, writing style, organizational structure, summary quality, and recommendation quality. The study used a counterbalanced design with eight conditions, presenting human or AI-generated reports for ADHD, intellectual disability, depression, and anxiety. Participants then provided ratings of quality through an online survey. Human-generated reports were preferred for their writing style (p = 0.026), organization (p = 0.042), and overall quality (p = 0.036), while the recommendations in AI-generated reports were favored (p &lt; 0.001). No significant differences were found in readability. Participants were more likely to prefer and approve human-generated reports for clinical use (p = 0.042), though the majority expressed discomfort with both types. While AI shows promise in augmenting psychological report writing, particularly in generating recommendations, human expertise remains crucial, especially in summarizing information. These findings highlight the need for professional guidelines on AI use in psychological practice and updated educational curricula to prepare future psychologists for an evolving technological landscape in mental health care.",

Data included open-ended survey responses from trainers (N = 60) in school psychology programs regarding assessment practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings indicated that ChatGPT-4 could conduct QCA with products that were similar, overall, to human coders, and in significantly less time. However, ChatGPT-4’s process was not transparent, and some codes and themes were unclear. Meanwhile, human coding allowed for the selection and implementation of a purposeful methodological approach, and an auditable and systematic process resulting in a coherent narrative.

          "abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into school psychology is evolving rapidly, presenting both opportunities and challenges. AI has the potential to enhance educational and mental health services by facilitating data-driven decision-making, streamlining administrative tasks, and offering personalized interventions for students. However, biases inherent in AI systems—reflecting the prejudices of developers and historical data—pose significant risks of exacerbating systemic inequalities. This paper examines AI’s historical context, current applications in education, and specific uses within school psychology. It also discusses the socio-political factors contributing to algorithmic biases, data privacy concerns, and language/cultural inequities in AI systems. Recommendations are offered to mitigate AI biases, emphasizing the importance of diverse representation in AI development, comprehensive policy formation, transparency, and community involvement. Addressing these concerns is crucial for ensuring that AI contributes equitably to student success.",

Prior work has documented the influence of similarity in temporal, semantic, emotional, and physical space on recall dynamics. We asked whether phonological similarity also impacts the dynamics of free recall. Analyzing data from a large delayed free recall experiment, we find that participants cluster their recalls based on alliterative and rhyming patterns in the encoded words, and such organization predicts recall performance. We also discover that phonological features induce false memories, and that phonological similarity interacts with temporal and semantic features to accelerate recall transitions. Our results further catalog how similarity, in its many forms, dictates the dynamics of free recall.",

          "abstract": "Most theories of suicide suggest that it occurs as a result of negative affect, but surprisingly few studies test nuanced associations between negative affect and suicidal thoughts. We hypothesized that negative affect would be especially likely to predict suicidal thoughts among those with strong emotion reactivity: that is, those with greater sensitivity, intensity, and persistence of negative affect when it is experienced. We used ecological momentary assessment to examine the real-time process of how emotion reactivity interacts with affect to predict suicidal thinking. As hypothesized, across two samples (n=43 college students reporting suicidal ideation; n=52 individuals with a history of suicide attempt recruited online), results revealed that the association between momentary negative affect and suicidal thinking was stronger among those with greater trait emotion reactivity. Regarding individual facets of emotion reactivity, the interaction with intensity was significant in Study 1, whereas the interactions with persistence and sensitivity were significant in Study 2. These findings support the real-world components of the emotion reactivity model, suggesting trait-level patterns of emotional responses are important to consider in modeling and analyzing momentary mood states. Between-sample inconsistencies between which facets drove this relationship may speak to individual differences in emotional processing.",

          "abstract": "Theoretical models of repetitive negative thinking suggest that multiple factors contribute to rumination, placing one at risk for depression. However, temporal dynamics of rumination and related cognitive  risk factors remain poorly understood. Here, we aimed to model the time-varying associations between depressed mood, metacognitive beliefs, promotion focus, attentional control, and rumination in daily life using an ecological momentary assessment approach (EMA). Participants at risk for depression (n = 95) completed an intensive EMA procedure (6 times a day for 21 days). We relied on multi-level vector autoregressive modelling (mlVAR) to obtain temporal, contemporaneous and between-subjects networks. The temporal network showed that fluctuations in rumination were predicted by prior ruminative state, attentional control, positive beliefs about rumination, self-consciousness, promotion focus, and depressed mood. The contemporaneous and between subjects networks demonstrated a co-activation of multiple nodes. Each of these analyses provided novel insights into the main cognitive factors and their temporal interplay in relation to rumination.  Overall, the results converge with integrative theoretical models suggesting bidirectional temporal associations and highlight potential direct and indirect targets for interventions to modify rumination.",

          "abstract": "Giving people more time between encoding items into working memory (WM) improves performance. In complex span tasks performance depends on the cognitive load imposed by a secondary task carried out between encoding items; free time is one variable determining cognitive load. Explanations of the effects of time and of cognitive load on working memory often build on the assumption that time is used for maintenance processes such as rehearsal or refreshing. This leads to the prediction that a manipulation of time has a retroactive effect on items encoded before. In contrast, the encoding resource account suggests that free time has a proactive benefit by replenishing encoding resources between items, thereby improving encoding of subsequent items. In two studies, we examined whether giving additional free time resulted in a proactive or retroactive benefit in a modified complex-span task. We found that, whereas the secondary task led to a retroactive detriment, the free time benefit was proactive. These findings call for a new\nway of thinking about the effect of cognitive load in WM.",

High worry and low self-efficacy may be rather prominent among parents with adolescents with depression, but how this may in turn have an effect on parenting behaviors, such as warmth and criticism, is not well known. In a healthy control (i.e, 80 adolescents, M_age = 15.90, SD_age = 1.35; 151 parents, M_age = 49.04, SD_age = 5.87) and depression sample (i.e., 34 adolescents with depression, M_age = 15.65, SD_age = 1.54; 58 parents, M_age = 50.10, SD_age = 5.30), we estimated Gaussian graphical network models on adolescent-reported affect states (i.e., happy, relaxed, sad, &amp; irritated), adolescent- and parent-reported parenting behaviors (i.e., warmth, understanding, listening, criticism, dominance), and parent-reported parental worry and self-efficacy. Parents of adolescents with depression reported higher levels of worry, but not less self-efficacy. In both samples, parent-reported worry was positively related to adolescent-reported sadness and parent-reported parental criticism. Moreover, parent-reported self-efficacy was positively related to adolescent- and parent-reported parental warmth. Only in the depression sample, parent-reported worry was positively related to adolescent-reported parental warmth. Parental worry, self-efficacy, parenting behaviors and adolescent affect were interrelated with considerable differences between the control and depression sample. As a next step, studies with more intensive daily assessments may yield individual family analyses, while also accounting for contextual factors, to further increase our understanding of the relation between parental worry, self-efficacy and parenting behaviors in the context of adolescent depression.",

Study 2 replicated the effect and tested its potential mechanism: the tendency to moralize rationality mediated the relationship between scientism and support for penalizing measures.

          "abstract": "The last 15 years of research on language production and comprehension have put forward a conceptual revolution, highlighting how language may depend not only on specific brain areas but also on embodied processes underpinned by sensorimotor brain regions. A large amount of studies have underlined the sensorimotor grounding of the different processes at play in language comprehension, in particular action verb processing and sentence comprehension (see Fischer &amp; Zwaan, 2008 and Franken et al., 2022 for reviews). One aspect of language processing, phoneme perception, has been less extensively studied in light of embodied cognition, yet the motor involvement in decoding sounds pertaining to a linguistic code seems to play a crucial contribution. The focus of the current review is to provide an updated overview of the findings in this domain on both native (Sections I and II) and foreign (i.e. non-native) phoneme perception (Section III), and to further examine if and how motor training may enhance phonological processing and learning of foreign language speech sounds (Section IV and V).",

          "abstract": "Social media have fundamentally transformed how we live and communicate. However, the methods to study how our cognitive systems interact with technology platforms are very limited. Computational modelling represents a new avenue to uncover the finegrained cognitive processes driving social media behaviour. Here, we develop a novel computational model of real-world social media posting data, adapted from the animal reward learning literature. Across a Twitter dataset (n= 2,696 users), including a preregistered confirmatory sample, we separate the contribution of different cognitive processes and show that a hybrid goal-directed and habitual reward-seeking process underlies social media posting behaviour. Further, younger people and women are more goal-directed – updating their strategy more purposefully to maximise social media rewards – while older users and men tend to be more habitual. Our model paves the way for large-scale investigation into the cross-species cognitive processes motivating social media behaviours, and their downstream impacts on individuals and society.",

          "abstract": "Fun, play, and humour are accepted as integral to understanding how individuals cope with adversity at work and thrive within an organization. Far from being merely about entertainment, Fun at Work (FaW) embodies strategic elements via social bonding, essential for bolstering employee well-being, fostering engagement, and enhancing productivity. The present meta-analysis and narrative synthesis examined the relationship between FaW with work engagement and job burnout. The results of the meta-analysis showed a substantial overlap between Work Engagement and FaW and a smaller overlap with emotional exhaustion. Meta-regression indicated that the relationship between FaW and work engagement was stronger in Non-WEIRD countries and studies with samples including a higher proportion of men. The narrative review revealed two primary and bidirectional categories that capture the essence of workplace fun: Organization-Driven Fun (ODF) and Employee-Driven Fun (EDF). ODF and EDF provided the basis for a new conceptual approach to FaW outlined in the paper. The paper reflects on whether FaW  might be inherently part of work engagement rather than a separate construct, functioning as a job resource.",

          "abstract": "Converging evidence from behavioural, neuroimaging, and neurostimulation studies demonstrates that action observation engages linked action production mechanisms, a phenomenon termed covert or automatic imitation. Behaviourally, automatic imitation is measured using the stimulus response compatibility (SRC) task, in which participants produce vocal responses whilst perceiving compatible or incompatible speech distractors. Automatic imitation is measured as the difference in response times (RT) between incompatible and compatible trials. It is unclear if and how social group membership, such as the speaker’s sex, affects automatic imitation. Two theoretical accounts make conflicting predictions regarding effects of group membership: the first predicts that automatic imitation can be modulated by group membership, while the second predicts that automatic imitation remains unaffected. We tested these predictions for participant sex and distractor sex in an online vocal SRC task. Female and male participants completed an SRC task presenting female or male distractor stimuli. The results show that automatic imitation is not modulated by group membership. Implications of these results regarding the nature of automatic imitation are considered.",

          "abstract": "Since learning to read involves associating letter shapes with how they sound, it is widely believed that children become familiar with letter shapes when they start learning their sounds or start writing them down. However, since printed letters are often available in the environment, it is possible that children are already familiar with letter shapes. Here, we provide evidence for this intriguing possibility. We tested 300 children at the beginning of formal reading instruction of the Indian language Kannada. Each child performed four tasks: (1) a letter familiarity task in which they saw upright and inverted versions of each letter, and had to identify the more familiar orientation; (2) a letter recognition task where they had to name letters shown sequentially; (3) a visual search task where they had to find an oddball letter among identical other letters, with letters either all upright or inverted; and (4) a rapid automatized naming task where they had to name digits. Our main finding is that, despite showing wide variation in letter naming, children were highly familiar with letter orientation. This effect was present even on letters that children did not recognize at all. This familiarity with letter orientation also gave them a letter processing advantage: children searched faster when letters were upright than when they were inverted. Our findings reveal a far deeper knowledge of print among early readers than previously observed, and provide empirical support for early exposure to print as a strategy to jump-start reading acquisition.",

This lack of formalized criteria is concerning given today’s unprecedented demand for competent analysts both within and beyond psychology. In light of this demand — and the virtually non-existent scholarship on the human side of data analysis practice — we enthusiastically call for a new area of research: the Psychology of Data Analysis, which prioritizes a person-centered approach that seeks to understand the judgment, decision-making, and behavior of data analysts in real-world contexts. We close by posing some open questions that researchers interested in learning more about the human side of scientific practice could ask, and hope that readers will join us in answering them.",

Sometimes teams, families, companies, and other organizations agree on explicit rules governing such collaboration, and these are backed by moral force: To violate the rule is wrong. Other times, however, we find ways to collaborate on the fly, without rules or norms, or even explicit communication. This often requires inferring a joint plan—imagining “what coordination would we agree to, if we could?”—and playing our surmised role. Is it also considered morally wrong to violate an inferred joint plan?  In five preregistered experiments (n = 1,506), we show that deviating from an inferred joint plan is perceived as morally problematic, even without prior communication or agreement.  In other words, just as the agreements we actually make are morally binding, so too are the patterns of conduct that we infer our social partners would agree upon.",

While emerging evidence points to psychedelic agents being novel avenues for the treatment of substance use disorders, the predominantly Western medical models of psychedelic-assisted therapy being developed lack Indigenous wisdom and input, raising concerns about safety, efficacy, ownership, and continuing colonial dynamics. In Aotearoa (New Zealand), the enduring impacts of colonisation on Māori include the suppression of Indigenous wisdom, even as research affirming the knowledge and practice of traditional Māori healing is on the rise. \n\nThe Tū Wairua project will explore the integration of rongoā Māori (traditional Māori healing practices) with psilocybin-assisted therapy (PAT) for addressing problematic methamphetamine use (PMU) in Māori communities. This Māori-led project is driven by kaupapa Māori methodology and rongoā Māori conceptualisations of health and informed by biomedical psychedelic science. Based at Rangiwaho Marae in Te Tairāwhiti, a community with a high Māori population and a significant burden of PMU, the project aims to develop a culturally-appropriate PAT to explore the efficacy of psilocybin in treating PMU. \n\nThis research represents a shift toward health interventions that respect and extend Indigenous wisdom, addressing the unique needs of Māori communities. It also seeks to develop a skilled Māori workforce to continue these healing practices, and challenge current legislation that restricts the use of Indigenous psychedelics. In creating sustainable pathways for healing through a community-driven, culturally-resonant PAT, Tū Wairua charts new directions in Indigenous-led psychedelic science",

          "abstract": "When accused of misconduct, politicians often account for their behavior. Previous experimental research has found mitigating accounts (including concessions and excuses, which acknowledge blameworthiness) and aggravating accounts (including justifications and refusals, which minimize or deny wrongdoing) to have important effects on people’s impressions of errant politicians. But are politicians who rely on one strategy versus another any more likely to win actual elections? We constructed a novel dataset documenting Representatives’ public remarks in response the 1992 House Bank Scandal, during which 266 U.S. Representatives from both major political parties were accused of misusing House Bank funds. We observed three key results. First, contrary to predictions, mitigating strategies were not associated with electoral failure among more frequent House Bank “offenders” (whose mitigating strategies were presumably less credible). Second, some aggravating strategies (refusals) were associated with electoral failure—unless incumbents’ party had a secure majority in their district. Finally, this tendency for refusals to predict failure in “safe” partisan districts obtained only in general (not primary) elections, reducing the number of unobserved variables that might be confounded with district partisanship and still incline voters to tolerate aggravating accounts. Results suggest that politicians’ responses to scandals predict real-world election outcomes—depending on district-level characteristics.",

While tools for measuring dyadic trust in close relationships exist in Western contexts, there has been a lack of validated instruments for measuring trust in close relationship within Chinese cultural contexts. This study sought to adapt and validate the Dyadic Trust Scale (DTS) for Chinese populations using two independent samples (n = 204; n = 377). Through item analysis, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, Item 1 was removed from the original DTS and a two-factor model comprising 7 items was emerged for the Chinese version, contrasting with the previous one-factor models. We labeled the two factors as Trustworthiness (ordinal α = 0.88) and Security (ordinal α = 0.73) respectively. The adapted DTS also demonstrated very good convergent and discriminant validity, along with very good criterion validity, as evident by correlations with relationship satisfaction assessed by the Relationship Assessment Scale (RAS). Our findings support the Chinese DTS as a psychometrically reliable and valid tool for assessing dyadic trust in close relationships in China, paving the way for further research in this area.",

This study investigates the relationship between parent-infant interaction, language development and infant regulation, as well as the distinct roles of mothers and fathers.\nA total of 40 mother-child dyads were examined at six months postpartum. Self-report questionnaires were used to evaluate maternal depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), parental attachment-related attitudes (Revised Adult Attachment Scale), and infant regulation (Questionnaire for Crying, Feeding and Sleeping). Mother-infant interactions were recorded on video and subsequently evaluated using the Infant CARE-Index, with an additional assessment of father-infant interaction in a smaller subsample of 20 dyads.\nThe findings indicate that higher maternal depressive symptoms were linked to an increased prevalence of infant regulatory challenges, such as crying and sleep difficulties. Notably, fathers demonstrated significantly higher interaction quality than mothers, despite similar co-regulatory behaviors between parents. These results underscore the impact of maternal mental health on infant regulation and emphasize the importance of father involvement in early child development.",

Two relevant forms of such thinking are Theory of Mind (ToM) that enables us to represent others’ perspectives, and Mental Time Travel (MTT) that enables us to represent other points in time. The present studies investigate how these capacities are related in development. Do they build on the same cognitive foundations and thus emerge together? Do higher-order forms of the two abilities rely on analogous recursive embedding and thus progress in parallel and coordinated ways? We addressed these questions in four studies with 3- to 9-year-old children (N = 395). ToM was operationalized as first-, second-, and third-order false belief understanding. MTT was operationalized as reasoning about future possibilities (first-order), counterfactual reasoning (second-order) and anticipating counterfactual emotions (third-order). Study 1 shows a stepwise development of both ToM and MTT and a moderate consistency of performance patterns. However, across all four studies, we did not find robust correlations between first-, second- and third-order tasks of ToM and MTT, respectively. Overall, these results show stepwise and parallel trajectories in ToM and MTT, but do not provide stringent evidence for a joint cognitive foundation of the two capacities.",

Day-to-day behaviours contribute to poor air quality (AQ) but limited public understanding of AQ warrants effective communication strategies to promote awareness and empower positive behavioural change.\n\n\nObjective:\nThrough the integration of behavioural, science communication, and socio-ecological frameworks, this rapid review mapped existing AQ-related communication interventions and their influence on AQ awareness, on protective and/or mitigating behaviours (i.e., avoiding exposure; reducing polluting activities), and on boosting civic engagement.\n\n\nMethods:\nBuilding on previous evidence syntheses, we conducted a comprehensive literature search of peer-reviewed and grey literature, including 79 studies for analysis. Findings were synthesised narratively and assessed for quality with the QuADS tool. We followed the Population, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes, and Study designs (PICOS) criteria and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.\n\n\nResults:\nDespite high heterogeneity in intervention types, most served a persuasion or enablement function, often utilising dissemination modes such as websites or web applications, and most assessed awareness and/or engagement in protective behaviours. While most interventions focused on individual/household-level actions and interindividual dynamics, only some considered policy-level actions, and very few embedded infrastructural considerations in their communication. Overall, 47 studies reported positive impacts on awareness and/or behaviours, particularly through participatory approaches, although we noted issues associated with promoting meaningful participation and identified influencing psychosocial factors. Evidence of effectiveness for behaviours was often limited by observational designs and the focus on awareness only or self-reported behaviours/intentions.\n\n\nSignificance:\nOur findings highlight that top-down communication intervention can have a positive influence on AQ awareness, while findings on behavioural impact are mixed. We highlight growing attempts to communicate AQ-related risks and behavioural solutions through empowering approaches that are sensitive to individual and local circumstances, but note the need for further work to foster mitigating behaviours and civic engagement.",

          "abstract": "A well-known problem of null hypothesis significance testing is that it cannot be used to find support for the null hypothesis. A common solution for this is to replace the exact 0 value by an interval associated with values that are close to zero. This approach is denoted as equivalence testing and is a special case of procedures that test intervals of values against each other. Smiley et al. (2023) recently published a unified framework of statistical inference and suggested a straightforward method of testing all sorts of interval-based hypotheses in a unified way. The present paper discusses three alternative general approaches, based on Bayesian analysis, which have the advantage that the ensuing probabilities can be interpreted as probabilities of the population parameters, rather than probabilities of the data (as is the case with frequentist methods). These methods (in some form) have been previously suggested, but here we bring them together and show how they can be used for Smiley et al.’s full unified framework of statistical inference, now complementing it with three Bayesian counterparts. In particular, it is shown how each of the methods work in the analysis of a leading example data set involving a test on proportions. Subsequently, their relative pros and cons are discussed, and it is explained how the methods can be used for many statistical analysis questions in practice, using R and/or JASP. This is illustrated on an empirical data set for comparing means of two groups.",

We differentiate between poor readers and general school readers, considering intervention type, syllabic complexity, and the type of reading outcomes as moderators. Our search encompassed randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental trials that assessed digital interventions targeting cognitive or specifically reading-related skills, including a control group, published between 2000 and 2022. We included 41 studies (k = 194) for poor readers and 15 studies (k = 69) for general readers. Our findings from multilevel meta-analyses with robust variance estimation show positive impacts on reading performance for both poor (medium effect size: g = 0.433, CI = [0.3; 0.56], p &lt; 0.001) and general readers (small effect size: g = 0.256, CI = [.08; 0.43], p = 0.009). Notably, domain-specific interventions aided both reader types, while domain-general interventions were effective only for poor readers. The impact of syllabic complexity was limited, with only numerically stronger effects in languages with simpler syllabic structures. Effect sizes did not differ significantly between decoding and comprehension outcomes. These findings highlight the potential of tailored digital interventions to enhance reading skills, especially for those facing reading challenges, and underscore the need for considering additional characteristics in intervention design.",

          "abstract": "Minority stress theory poses that distal and proximal stressors cause sexual minority groups to experience excess stress, which can lead to poor mental health outcomes. Szymanski and Mikorski (2016) found that proximal internalised heterosexism mediated the relationship between distal heterosexist discrimination and psychological distress in a sample of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. Meaning in life also moderated some of these pathways. Whilst this mediating relationship is established, research in this area typically examines all sexual minority people together. It is important, however, to explore the unique experiences of lesbian women independent of other sexual minority groups. Therefore, the present study aimed to conceptually replicate Szymanski and Mikorski’s (2016) findings in a sample of lesbian women. We examined the mediating role of internalised heterosexism in the heterosexist discrimination and psychological distress relationship in 363 UK lesbians. The moderating role of meaning in life, both search for and presence of, were also investigated. This was a cross-sectional self-report study with data collected from May 2024 to August 2024. In line with the original research, a moderated mediation analysis showed that internalised heterosexism significantly mediated the heterosexist discrimination and psychological distress link. However, no moderating role of search for meaning, nor presence of meaning was found, which did not replicate the results of the original study. This difference could be due to specific sample characteristics. Therefore, these results highlight the need for sexual minority women to be centralised in research in order to produce interventions tailored to specific sexual minority groups.",

          "abstract": "The key educational transition from primary to secondary school occurs during the sensitive developmental period of early adolescence, when students are developing self-regulatory abilities and facing a new array of challenges. Of concern, a decline in wellbeing has been observed following this educational transition. However, little is known about how the self-regulation of cognitions (metacognition) and emotions (emotion regulation) are related to adolescent students’ wellbeing following this transition. Here, we investigate whether metacognition and emotion regulation are related to student’s subjective academic and personal wellbeing, in a sample of 134 students (59 male, 75 female) aged 12-14 years (M = 12.88 years, SD = 0.67 years) in the early years of Australian secondary school. This study was cross-sectional, and data were collected in 2022/2023.  Participants completed a series of computer-based tasks and questionnaires designed to capture metacognition, emotion regulation, executive functions (working memory, attention control and cognitive flexibility) and wellbeing (academic wellbeing and personal wellbeing). Both metacognition and emotion regulation made significant and distinct contributions to adolescents’ academic and personal wellbeing, with metacognition playing a larger role in academic wellbeing and emotion regulation making larger contributions to personal wellbeing. Of import, the contributions of metacognition and emotion regulation to wellbeing were observed after accounting for underlying individual differences in executive functions.

          "authors": "Megan Elizabeth Schultz; Jonas Dora; Kevin Michael King",
          "abstract": "Objective: Alcohol expectancy theory proposes that beliefs about drinking motivate or deter drinking. Although expectancies influence drinking, less is known about how the consequences of drinking influence expectancies. We modeled a feedback conceptualization of how the experience of specific consequences influenced people’s beliefs about how likely a consequence will occur (i.e., likelihoods) and how positive the consequence will be (i.e., valences). Method: We re-analyzed cross-sectional data from college drinkers (n = 504), using Bayesian cross-classified multilevel ordinal regressions to estimate associations between consequences, likelihoods, and valences. We performed a preregistered replication in new data (n = 362). Results: Participants had higher likelihoods (95% CIStudy 1 = [2.06, 2.43], 95% CIStudy 2 = [1.75, 2.12]) and valences (95% CIStudy 1 = [0.28, 0.52], 95% CIStudy 2 = [0.33, 0.60]) when they had experienced consequences more often, but these associations leveled off at higher consequence frequencies. Participants also believed consequences to be more likely when they viewed them as more positive, and vice versa, and again, these associations leveled off at higher levels of the predictor. Critically, the strength of these associations varied across both people and consequences. Conclusions: Experiencing specific consequences more often was related to people judging them to be more likely and more positive in the future, aligning with alcohol expectancy theory. This may lead to experiencing negative consequences repeatedly because people are not being demotivated from drinking in the same fashion. Given the person and consequence level variability, clinicians should consider an individualized approach when targeting drinking consequences.  \n\nKeywords: alcohol, college drinking, expectancies, consequences",

          "abstract": "Background: Childhood maltreatment is associated with a higher risk for developing psychological disorders, such as depression or anxiety. Dysfunctional emotion regulation (ER) has been implicated as a neurocognitive mechanism linking adverse childhood experiences to an increased risk for psychopathological outcomes. \nObjective: This preregistered study investigated the relation between childhood maltreatment and different aspects of ER, including implementation capacity and effort as well as tendency and flexibility in strategy selection.\nMethods: In a non-clinical adult sample (N = 227), childhood maltreatment was assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. In two experimental ER tasks, participants viewed pictures of varying emotional intensity while applying one of three ER strategies (distraction, reappraisal, suppression) or without any active regulation. The ER implementation task allowed to assess emotion reactivity, implementation capacity, and subjective effort for ER. The ER selection task allowed to assess tendency and flexibility in strategy selection. \nResults: Childhood maltreatment was associated with a lower capacity to implement reappraisal (r = -.12), a stronger tendency to choose suppression (r = .15), and lower flexibility in ER strategy selection (r = -.12). Contrary to our hypotheses, there was no significant association to experimentally assessed emotion reactivity or subjective effort exerted on ER.\nConclusions: We show that people with childhood maltreatment experiences do not only choose suppression more frequently but seem to have a deficit in flexibly adjusting strategy selection to context factors, e.g., stimulus intensity. This can be interpreted as an important factor rendering emotion regulation less adaptive in a clinical sense.",

          "abstract": "Recent geopolitical events have exposed critical gaps in the ability of peace and conflict psychology (PCP) to engage with conflicts beyond intractable or post-war contexts. This paper introduces the concept of \"naïve pacifism\" to describe underlying assumptions in PCP that hinder its ability to address complex modern conflicts effectively. Three pillars of naïve pacifism are identified: (1) the homeostatic view of peace as the natural state and violence as a dysfunction, (2) the belief in the reactive nature of violence, and (3) a perspectivist approach that overlooks objective features of conflicts. These assumptions lead PCP researchers to oversimplify, perpetuate pseudoscientific views of and promote ineffective interventions to solve violent conflicts. By challenging these pillars and proposing a more nuanced framework, this paper aims to advance PCP toward a true science of peace-making that is better equipped to address contemporary global conflicts.",

Yet, how social categorization becomes automatic is not entirely clear. The present work tests whether and how priming conceptual knowledge of social categories might influence the efficiency of social categorization across development. Children (N = 223; Mage = 7.24, SDage = 2.51; 132 girls, 90 boys; 50.26% racially minoritized; 49.74% White) were primed with gender-relevant, race-relevant, or neutral words and then gender-categorized racially diverse faces under a time constraint. Priming concepts of social categories delayed categorization for White children 6 years and younger. By 12 years, priming categories facilitated White children’s automatic categorizations. Conceptual priming did not affect the efficiency of racially minoritized children’s social categorizations. Top-down information then contributes to how social categorization becomes efficient, but children’s identity influences what information they use to inform categorizations.",

          "abstract": "This reply to Conway et al. (2024) illustrates how points of contention in the evaluation of mindreading (or Theory of Mind) measures can arise from the use of divergent validity concepts. The construct validity model used in Wendt and colleagues’ (2024) empirical study contrasts with the perspective implicit in Conway and colleagues' commentary, which is more consistent with Lennon's content validity model. This is reflected in the authors' conception of the nature of what is to be measured (i.e., the measurand), the criterion for what makes a measure superior (i.e., validity), and the proposed methods for judging this (i.e., validation). The mismatch between the validity concepts adopted by the respective authors has three major implications: First, Conway and colleagues' critique does not fully address the specific goals, assumptions, and intricacies of construct validation methodology. Second, their approach to measuring mindreading should not be confused with, or considered as an alternative to, construct validation, but is valuable in its own right. Third, the two validity frameworks mentioned offer unique opportunities for different phases of the research process. While a content validity approach can be valuable for describing an empirical phenomenon that seems worthy of explanation (e.g., real-world mindreading), a construct validity approach helps identify the theoretical constructs that might help explain it (e.g., mindreading ability).",

          "abstract": "Construal level has been shown to influence economic decisions, affecting both risk perception and risk-taking. However, there has been some inconsistency as to the exact effects of high/low construal on economic decisions, with some findings suggesting that construal might interact with cognitive load and self-control in a risk-taking context. In two experiments, the current paper examines behavioural and neurological (using functional near-infrared spectroscopy) responses to high and low construal manipulations during and economic decision task, under experimentally-induced cognitive load. We also examine the how construal interacts with self-control, financial literacy and subjective numeracy to predict lateral pre-frontal cortex (LPFC) activation during these decisions. Some of the behavioural results supported previous findings that under cognitive load, high construal prompts risk aversion. Neurological data supported the theory that construal promotes risk sensitivity. Self-control, financial literacy and subjective numeracy were all found to interact with construal in predicting LPFC activation during decision-making. These findings extend our understanding of how construal effects economic decisions under cognitive load while also providing new insights into how self-control, financial literacy and subjective numeracy might interact with construal in this context.",

          "abstract": "Objectivity has long been touted as a virtue in science, and certain statistical (e.g., null hypothesis significance testing) and scientific methods have been championed as means for obtaining objectivity. One way in which objectivity has been championed is through the use of universal statistical significance tests, where researchers conclude results are statistically significant when p&lt;0.05. While such objective criteria may improve communication and increase consensus, it does so at a cost. Specifically, objective criteria (such as p value threshholds) provide a means whereby poor quality studies can pass publication filters, they stifle creativity, and they thwart the self-correcting mechanisms of the scientific process. In this paper, I argue in favor of embracing ambiguity, either by allowing scientists to define their own criteria for statistical significance or by allowing researchers to refrain from making any decisions of statistical significance entirely. While allowing researchers to set their own decision criteria will inevitably lead to disagreements and a lack of consensus, it will only do so when evidence is weak. This is exactly as it should be, as disagreement should be welcomed in cases of interpretive ambiguity.. I conclude this paper by giving practical recommendations about how researchers might develop their own decision criteria using metrics relevant to their variables of interest.",

In\nthis study, we disentangled different dimensions of turn-taking by investigating how the\ndynamics of child-adult interactions changed according to the activity (task-oriented versus\nfreer conversation) and the familiarity of the interlocutor (familiar versus unfamiliar).\nTwenty-eight autistic children (16 male; Mage = 10.8 years) and 20 age-matched typically\ndeveloping children (8 male; Mage = 9.6) participated in seven task-orientated face-to-face\nconversations with their caregivers (336 total conversations) and seven more telephone\nconversations alternately with their caregivers (144 total conversations, 60 with typical\ndevelopment group) and an experimenter (191 total conversations, 112 with autism\ngroup). By modelling inter-turn response latencies in multi-level Bayesian location-\nscale models to include long tails, we found good test-rest reliability across sessions and\ncontexts, and showed that context strongly shaped group differences in response latencies.\nAutistic children exhibited more overlaps, produced faster response latencies and shorter\npauses than than typically developing children – and these group differences were stronger\nwhen conversing with the unfamiliar experimenter. Unfamiliarity also made the relation\nbetween individual differences and latencies evident: only in conversations with the\nexperimenter were higher socio-cognitive skills, lower social motivation and lower social\nawareness associated with faster responses. Information flow and shared tempo were also\ninfluenced by familiarity: children adapted their response latencies to the predictability\nand tempo of their interlocutor’s turn, but only when interacting with their caregivers\nand not the experimenter. These results highlight the need to construe turn-taking as\na multicomponential construct that is shaped by individual differences, interpersonal\ndynamics, and the affordances of the context.",

Uncovering the behavioral basis of AC role-play assessments is, however, a prerequisite for the optimization of existing and the development of novel automated AC procedures. This work provides a first data-driven benchmark for the behavioral prediction and explanation of AC performance judgments. We used machine learning models trained on behavioral cues (C = 36) to predict performance judgments in three interpersonal AC exercises from a real-life high-stakes AC (selection of medical students, N = 199). Three main findings emerged: First, behavioral prediction models showed substantial predictive performance and outperformed prediction models representing potential judgment biases. Comparisons with in-sample results revealed overfitting of traditional approaches, highlighting the importance of out-of-sample evaluations. Second, we demonstrate that linear combinations of behavioral cues can be strong predictors of assessors’ judgments. Third, we identified consistent exercise-specific patterns of individual cues and cross-exercise consistent behavioral patterns of behavioral dimensions and interpersonal strategies that were especially predictive of the assessors’ judgments. We discuss implications for future research and practice.",

In this study, we investigated how exclusive victimhood was related to geopolitical attitudes in Hungary and Serbia. The study involved Serbian (N = 630) and Hungarian (N = 471) adult national samples stratified by gender, age, political orientation, and place of residence. As expected, exclusive victimhood predicted higher support for a geopolitical shift from the West (i.e., EU and US) to the East (i.e., Russia and China) via Euroscepticism in both samples. In Serbia, the strongest indirect effect was observed among participants with neutral attitudes towards the war in Ukraine. In Hungary, there was no expected moderated mediation while the direct effect of exclusive victimhood on the West-to-East geopolitical shift was largest for pro-Russian participants and non-significant for pro-Ukrainian participants. Different measures of ethnic identity showed no expected moderation effect, but an exploratory analysis revealed that exclusive victimhood partially mediated the relationship between identity measures (superiority and attachment) and support for a pro-Eastern (vs. pro-Western) geopolitical orientation. We discuss how the construals of the past based on exclusive victimhood shape future geopolitical preferences of the public in Hungary and Serbia.",

Using a large, pre-registered study in which participants judge the accuracy of news posts, we demonstrate a striking dissociation between these two forms of confidence. While higher general confidence is associated with worse discernment of true versus false headlines (in line with past work), we find that higher confidence in specific judgments is associated with better truth discernment - a finding that we observe among both Democrats and Republicans. These results call for a reevaluation of the role of confidence in the detection of misinformation. Focusing on confidence in specific judgments, rather than general abilities, could play an important role in helping to mitigate belief in misinformation.",

Using multilevel response surface analysis and ecological momentary assessment, we investigated relations between affective congruence and empathy during social interactions in a large sample of adults (N=526; total interactions=21,521; median=38 interactions per person).

Social interaction is, thus, both an antecedent and a consequence of empowerment. In Western societies, an emerging awareness that aging has become associated with  a loss of empowerment has motivated efforts to better address this necessity in older adults. In this context, we created an innovative cognitive stimulation tool, where exercises are created by the users themselves as an alternative form of stimulation. After a period of intense dissemination in geriatric institutions, we encountered lower-than-expected levels of engagement. To understand whether this could be due to lack of material and human resources and/or lack of awareness regarding empowerment needs, we carried out semi-structured interviews with older adults and coordinating technicians in institutions. We found evidence that supported both a scenario of scarce institutional resources (“no time”) and a lack of awareness of empowerment needs, especially among older adults (“no need”).

          "abstract": "Background: Young adults in the United States are heavy users of social media which has been identified as a possible risk factor for depression. However, it is unclear whether social media use is associated with internalizing disorder symptom vulnerability beyond depression or whether it is related to other relevant symptom dimensions like externalizing symptoms (e.g., substance use). Moreover, it is unclear what aspects of social media use beyond frequency are associated to symptoms. Methods: A large cohort of undergraduate students from a Midwest university (N= 7123) participated in a screening of transdiagnostic symptoms of psychopathology. Data collected included: time spent on social media, social media platforms used, and aspects of problematic social media use (i.e., use for emotion regulation, compulsive use, or social-media-related impairment). We also collected sociodemographics and self-reported symptoms: depression, panic, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, alcohol use, drug use, insomnia, and pain. We correlated depression scores to time spent on social media to confirm prior findings of an association between social media use and depression. We then used a principal components analysis to identify shared dimensions of psychopathology across these symptoms and explored the correlations between symptom dimensions and elements of social media use. Results: Participants who reported higher social media usage exhibited significantly higher self-reported depression. Our PCA suggested two dimensions of psychopathology consistent with the HiTOP model which we dubbed “emotional” and “externalizing” symptoms. Time spent on social media was correlated with emotional symptoms and with externalizing symptoms, albeit to a lesser extent. However, these associations were not significant after controlling for problematic social media use. Moreover, problematic social media use had differential relations to dimensions of psychopathology. For example, using social media for emotion regulation was associated with more severe internalizing symptoms but less severe externalizing symptoms. E-value analysis suggested that unmeasured confounds could potentially explain these associations. Discussion: Our results suggest that the association between time spent on social media and psychopathology could be accounted for by the way in which social media is used, which in turn is differentially associated to emotional and externalizing symptoms. However, unmeasured confounding remains a threat to these inferences.",

We highlight research showing the impact of learning via interaction with family, peers, and the larger environment. Within these contexts, children learn both via the verbal testimonial information to which they are exposed, as well as through participating in rituals, and imitating other cultural group members. We indicate specific mechanisms that aid in the transmission of belief such as the credibility of the informant, the quality of the explanation posed to the child, and the saliency of the ritual. Such mechanisms can shed light on important ways in which to present novel information to learners across the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "This study uses unique auction data to study loss aversion in sellers. Our analysis of TV shows including 512 auctions and 3,940 offers reveals that sellers perceive the appraised market value as the reference price. Consistent with the predictions of prospect theory, the likelihood to bargain for higher offers as well as the willingness to sell then reflects loss aversion. Specifically, we find that most bargaining happens in the loss domain and that sellers are 6% more likely to bargain for higher offers when the current offer is below the appraised market value. Conversely, the median value of accepted offers falls precisely on the reference price and willingness to sell is 11% higher for offers in the gain domain. We also investigate reference point formation and find that sellers’ initial expectations affect the outcomes of auctions. Consistent with the application of a MinMax heuristic, sellers who initially underestimate the value of their item sell below the reference price while sellers who initially overestimate the value of their item sell above the reference price. Finally, we find that duration of ownership can positively influence sellers’ price expectations, but neither duration of ownership nor emotional attachment affect seller behavior.",

          "abstract": "This study examined the relationship between the theme of interdependence in the narratives of American adults with disabilities during the first three years of the COVID-19 pandemic and psychological well-being.  In contrast to independence, interdependence has emerged as a focus of research about people with disabilities in both the humanistic discipline of disability studies and in prior psychological research.  In the present study, 108 participants completed questionnaires assessing well-being and responded to three narrative prompts once a year between 2020 and 2022, resulting in a total of 952 narratives.  Narratives were reliably coded for the new narrative variable of interdependence.  In addition, narratives were also reliably coded for the narrative themes of independence, dependence, agency, submissiveness, communion, and disconnection.  The results of multi-level modeling analyses indicated that the themes of interdependence and disconnection were most strongly associated with psychological well-being over time.  Within-person analyses indicated that higher levels of interdependence were associated with lower levels of well-being in 2020 and with higher levels of well-being in 2022.  These results (along with a qualitative case study) suggest that the associations between narrative themes and well-being are contextualized and may demonstrate unusual associations during periods of extreme events, like the COVID-19 pandemic.  This study quantitatively establishes interdependence as an important narrative theme, one especially salient for people with disabilities.  It also suggests that people with disabilities may offer alternative ways of narrating contemporary American identity that might serve as an example for non-disabled and disabled people alike.",

          "abstract": "Twenty-five years ago, the publication of an article by Pallier, Colomé and Sebastián-Gallés (2001) launched a new and rapidly evolving research program on how second language (L2) learners represent the phonological forms of words in their mental lexicons. Many insights are starting to form an overall picture of the unique difficulties for establishing functional and precise phonolexical representations in L2; however, in order for the field to move forward it is pertinent to outline its major emerging research questions and existing challenges. Among significant obstacles for further research, the paper explores the current lack of theoretical agreement on the concept of phonolexical representations and the underlying mechanism involved in establishing them, as well as the variable use of the related terminology (e.g. fuzziness and target-like). Methodological challenges involved in investigating phonological processing and phonolexical representations as well as their theoretical implications are also discussed. To conclude, we explore the significance of L2-specific phonological representations for bottom-up lexical access during casual, conversational speech, and how our emerging knowledge of L2 lexical representations can be applied in an instructional setting as two potentially fruitful research avenues at the forefront of the current research agenda.",

          "abstract": "Cultural experiences can be a powerful influence on human cognition. Here, we asked whether the experience with written language, a human cultural invention, predicts the speed of spoken word recognition beyond any (potential) influence of spoken language experience. Previous research had obtained inconsistent and contradictory results using a variety of experimental methods. Using a large dataset (Hintz et al., 2024a) that is unprecedented in size (number of participants) and depth (number of skills assessed), 613 typically developed native Dutch adults between 18 and 30 years carried out a lexical decision task (ALDT), a standard spoken word recognition task. The task neither involved pictorial input nor sentential processing. Participants listened to Dutch words and nonwords and judged their lexical status as quickly as possible. We performed drift diffusion modelling on the lexical decision response times and focused on drift rate as an indicator for the amount of auditory information that individuals accumulate before deciding on non/words’ lexical status. We hypothesized that participants differed in the quality of their lexical representations due to their spoken and written language experience and thus in how quickly and efficiently these representations can be accessed. Hierarchical regression analyses on participants’ drift rate parameters revealed that written rather than spoken language experience predicts speed of spoken word recognition. Further research could be directed at elucidating the exact mechanisms of these cultural (reading) influences on spoken word recognition.",

          "abstract": "In conditional reasoning tests (CRTs), participants are asked to choose a response that follows logically from premises presented in the item stem. CRTs rest on the rationale that individuals with a high standing on an undesirable trait will draw inferences from the set of premises that provide a justification for their trait standing. In this preregistered study, we presented the CRT for aggression either with or without premises (N = 778). In line with the method’s rationale, results revealed that CRT-A scores were affected by the omission of premises. On the item level, for six out of 22 items, the frequency of choosing illogical responses did not differ when the premises were removed. Correlations with self-reported aggression were similar for both versions of the CRT-A. We conclude that the CRT-A is indeed viewed by test takers as a reasoning task and point to possible improvements on the item level.",

          "abstract": "Exposure to musical rhythms has been shown to influence the perception of subsequently presented speech. Until now, this effect has only been studied in native language (L1) processing. The present study investigated whether rhythmic priming could also benefit second language (L2) processing. A musical rhythmic priming experiment was designed based on previous studies in L1 children. Over two experiments, 66 L2 adult speakers of French were asked to detect grammatical errors in naturally spoken French sentences. Sentences were either preceded by a regular or an irregular musical rhythmic prime. We also assessed participants’ French language level, rhythmic perception abilities, and musical training. In Experiment 1, participants from various L1 backgrounds were recruited. In Experiment 2, only participants with a Latin native language were recruited. For both experiments, grammaticality judgments did not differ after regular versus irregular rhythmic primes. However, grammaticality judgments correlated significantly with rhythmic abilities, suggesting that participants with better rhythm perception were better at grammaticality judgment tasks. Moreover, musicians were better at detecting grammatical errors than those who had not received music training. We also found that the rhythmic priming effect (better grammatical judgments after regular than after irregular rhythms) increased with the number of years of musical training, suggesting that regular rhythmic primes may improve L2 perception in particular for musically trained participants. The results offer promising perspectives on the use of musical rhythmic primes as a means of improving language skills in second language acquisition, and on the potential impact of musical training on language processing.",

          "abstract": "The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and its corresponding (partial) area under the curve ([p-]AUC) are frequently used statistical tools in psychological research to assess the discriminability of a test, method, intervention, or procedure. In this paper, we provide a tutorial on how to conduct simulation-based power analyses for ROC curve and (p-)AUC analyses in R. We also created a ShinyApp to perform such power analyses. In our tutorial, we highlight the importance of setting a smallest effect size of interest (SESOI) for which researchers want to conduct their power analysis. The SESOI is the smallest effect that is practically or theoretically relevant for a specific field of research or study. We provide how such a SESOI can be established and how it changes hypotheses from simply establishing whether there is a statistically significant effect (i.e., null-hypothesis significance testing) to whether the effects are practically or theoretically important (i.e., minimum-effect testing) or whether the effect is too small to care about (i.e., equivalence testing). We show how power analyses for these different hypothesis tests can be conducted via a confidence interval focused approach. This confidence interval focused simulation-based power analysis can be adapted to different research designs and questions and improves the reproducibility of power analyses.",

          "authors": "Michał Obidziński; Nina Bażela; Mateusz Hohol",
          "abstract": "Despite extensive research on the cognitive basis for mathematical activity, the associations between long-term memory and math skills remain relatively understudied. In our fuzzy-trace theory-driven study, we addressed this issue by investigating the relationships between long-term memory for numbers and prominent math skills, namely approximate number processing, arithmetic fluency, and math reasoning, along with math self-concept. Individuals who performed better in the numerical memory task demonstrated better math reasoning, a higher math self-concept, and were more arithmetically fluent at the general level and in multiplication and division when analyzed separately, but not in addition, subtraction, or approximate number processing. Crucially, our memory task, based on the conjoint recognition model, allowed us to go beyond merely measuring overall performance and, as a result, to test fine-grained memory processes related to two memory traces: verbatim (remembering exact numbers) and gist (remembering a general intuition about a number’s magnitude). While both gist and verbatim processes were associated with different math skills, the associations with gist-based processes were more prominent. On the other hand, even though math self-concept was positively associated with overall numerical memory performance, it correlated significantly only with verbatim-based processes. We discuss our results in relation to the findings of a few previous fuzzy-trace theory-driven studies on mathematical cognition, highlighting discrepancies between them and their possible origins. Overall, our study shows the nuanced role of long-term memory in mathematical skills and demonstrates the power of fuzzy-trace theory in the fine-grained investigation of mathematical cognition.",

Despite their similarity, only half-modulating board produces perceptual change on a test patch.

          "abstract": "Peer review serves to evaluate the scientific validity and quality of research by other researchers within the same field. Psychology, like many other disciplines, uses peer review to determine whether researchers’ work is published, where it is published, and in what form. However, the peer review system is imperfect, often perpetuating harm, exclusion, and inequities. We believe these problems hinder psychology from becoming a truly representative and valid science. In this paper, we uncover the historical roots of the peer review system in psychology and describe how these roots persist today. Then, using personality psychology as an exemplar, we leverage a social justice lens to: (1) document key contemporary problems in the peer review system; (2) identify global challenges in peer review; and (3) provide recommendations and guiding questions that might help the field become more equitable, diverse, just, and inclusive. To do so, we draw upon three sources of information: our personal experiences, qualitative and quantitative data from 104 self-identifying personality psychologists, and the prior literature. Ultimately, the goal of this work is to give voice to those who have been harmed in peer review, and to inform how we might reimagine peer review in personality psychology and beyond.",

Using a novel paradigm, we tested people’s capacity to infer another person’s desires, beliefs, or visual experience across three logically equivalent tasks. Despite the logical equivalence, people were less accurate, slower, and reported expending more effort when inferring the content of others’ visual experience compared to inferring others' beliefs and desires (Experiments 1 and 2; N = 120 U.S. adults and N = 60 U.S. adults). However, additional training rapidly improved people’s capacity to infer others’ visual experience (Experiment 3; N = 60 U.S. adults).

          "authors": "Dustin Fife; Joseph Lee Rodgers",
          "abstract": "The standard undergraduate statistics curriculum, which focuses on testing hypotheses, was first developed a century ago when hand-calculations dominated statistical analysis. While graduate training has advanced somewhat, the undergraduate curriculum has remained relatively unchanged for the last 50-100 years. This situation is particularly troubling when one considers how it fails to prepare students for advanced statistical methods, perpetuates misunderstandings, and masks the underlying logic of statistics. It also is highly limited in its application, leading researchers to shoehorn their analyses into a hypothesis-testing framework. An alternative to the hypothesis-testing framework is one that focuses on building, evaluating, and comparing models. In this paper, we argue that a modeling framework (and an extension of modeling called ‘model comparisons’) highlights the underlying logic of statistics, deepens understanding of the language of statistics, prepares students for advanced procedures, and promotes sound statistical reasoning. We argue for a pedagogical shift away from the hypothesis testing status quo and toward a modeling framework, all while discussing obstacles to such a change and how such obstacles might be (fairly) easily overcome.",

          "authors": "Junsong Lu; Chujun Lin",
          "abstract": "People make a variety of social inferences about others in daily life. Long-standing research suggests that these inferences are captured by a few latent dimensions (e.g., warmth and competence). However, prior work relied on constrained designs (e.g., face images, forced ratings), limiting ecological validity. Others suggest that social inferences are more complex than just a few dimensions could summarize but lack empirical support. Here, we conducted two pre-registered studies to test the high-dimensional properties of social inferences. To maximize generalizability, we computationally sampled diverse naturalistic videos and recruited U.S. representative participants (N = 1,598). Participants freely described people in videos using their own words. Cross-validation identified 25 latent dimensions which explained only 15% of the variance in the data. Alternatively, a sparse network model representing the unique correlations between inferences unreducible to shared latent constructs better represented the data. The network models informed the dynamics of naturalistic inferences, revealing what inferences people tended to make for the same individual and how inferences shifted from concrete to abstract over time (Study 1). The network models also indicated cultural differences in how one social inference was related to another between samples (Study 2, Asian N = 651, European N = 792). Together, these findings show that the high-dimensional network approach provides an alternative, non-mutually exclusive model for understanding the mental representation of social inferences in naturalistic contexts, which provides new insights into the dynamics and diversities of social inferences beyond the static, universal structure found with the low-dimensional latent construct approach.",

          "abstract": "Background: The majority of research on emotion regulation processes has been restricted to controlled laboratory settings that use experimental paradigms to investigate short-term outcomes. A true understanding of emotion regulation requires an unobtrusive, ecologically valid assessment of the construct as it occurs in the environment. Digital phenotyping is a novel method for evaluating human behavior in naturalistic settings. \nObjective: This study aimed to evaluate whether smartphone-based digital phenotyping data predicts individual differences in emotion regulation in both in-lab and naturalistic settings.\nMethods: During an in-lab session, unselected university student participants (N = 69) completed self-report questionnaires measuring trait emotion regulation as well as state emotion regulation and state affect following a baseline period, a negative mood induction, and a recovery period. Smartphone-based digital phenotyping data were then collected over the course of a 7-day follow-up. Variation in global positioning system (GPS) distance and mobile power state level were examined as predictors of longitudinal variation in negative affect, emotion regulation, and depression. \nResults: Results showed that variation in GPS distance was significantly associated with variation in state cognitive reappraisal (b = -0.0004, SE = 0.0002, p = .02) and negative state affect (b = 0. 005, SE = 0.002, p = .01) over time. Variation in power state level was also significantly associated with variation in cognitive reappraisal over time (b = -4.98, SE = 1.72, p = .005) and marginally associated with variation in negative state affect (b = -29.58, SE = 16.73, p = .08) over time. Cluster and classification analyses showed both power state level and GPS distance accurately classified two trait emotion regulation clusters with high sensitivity (.95 and .96 respectively) and specificity (.86 and .97 respectively). Variation in power state level and GPS distance together with trait and state emotion regulation did not predict current depressive symptoms (ps &gt; .05).\nConclusions: Overall, the findings provide initial and foundational data on the use of digital phenotyping data in predicting individual differences in state and trait emotion regulation in both in-lab and naturalistic settings. The results suggest that operationalizations of digital phenotyping data and modeling approaches are particularly important factors to consider when implementing digital phenotyping methodology in the study of mental health processes such as emotion regulation.",

          "abstract": "The construct of racial microaggressions has been well-contested in the psychological literature, and numerous methodological challenges have been presented in terms of operationalizing and measuring racial microaggressions. To that end, racial microaggressions, stress, and coping may be best measured by combining ambulatory assessment and qualitative methods to better understand how microaggressions are contextualized in real-time. This study aimed to explore the day-level associations between perceived stress and racial microaggressions among graduate students of color using an 8-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) method. Participants (N=36; M age= 28.4, SD=2.24) completed a baseline survey and a 7-day EMA protocol, providing contextual information on instances of racial microaggressions as well as bi-daily measurements of perceived stress. Qualitative analysis of EMA data, utilizing thematic and content analysis, revealed that racial microaggressions were primarily verbal, often related to assumptions of threat or intelligence. Quantitative analysis using linear mixed-effect models indicated no significant associations between the frequency of racial microaggressions and changes in daily perceived stress. However, greater frequency of microaggressions measured via the Racial and Ethnic Microaggressions Scale (REMS) were significantly related to a greater frequency of racial microaggressions as measured by EMA. These findings provide insights into the frequency, context, and impact of racial microaggressions among graduate students of color and call upon future research to employ more data-intensive approaches to understand racial microaggressions' impact on mental well-being in other marginalized groups.",

Despite well-documented issues of validity and reliability with polygraphs, they continue to be used in various stages of the legal system. With Black individuals already facing disproportionate incarceration rates, the reduced reliability for skin conductance used in polygraphs for Black individuals can further exacerbate legal system inequity. Furthermore, these biases accentuate existing challenges interpreting polygraph results given their subjectivity as well as the heightened police-related anxiety reported among Black individuals. We join calls for re-evaluation and possibly exclusion of polygraph evidence in legal settings, considering the amplified risks it poses to Black individuals.",

          "abstract": "Bad actors and bots present threats to data integrity in remote research designs, compromising estimates of cognitive task performance. Here, we share our experiences and recommendations for identifying and preventing bad actors and bots from enrolling in remote studies of cognitive task performance. As part of a large-scale study, 3,488 participants were recruited through various platforms, including social media and MTurk, and were compensated for their participation. Participants were categorized according to bad actor status as determined by 1) number and risk-level associated with red flags within initial screening and pattern of responses; and 2) a researcher review process to identify patterns of aberrant, patterned, or inconsistent responding. Participants were either automatically labeled as bad actors (n=2,829), labeled as bad actors after researcher review (n=242), or labeled as good actors after researcher review (n=417). Cognitive task performance was assessed with Adaptive Cognitive Evaluation Explorer (ACE-X), a mobile, gamified collection of executive function tasks including measures of working memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility. We considered differences between good and bad actors for mean response times, variability in response times, accuracy, and number of trials attempted. Across 6 of the 7 ACE-X tasks evaluated, bad actors responded slower than good actors on average (β=34.10-150.15, P&lt;.001-.047). Additional differences in task performance suggested that overall, bad actors also tended to be more variable in their response times (β=-0.32-1.01, P&lt;.001), less accurate (β=-2.15-.00, P&lt;.001-1.000), and responded to fewer trials (β=-1.30-.00, P&lt;.001-1.000).

          "abstract": "Receiving affirmation, whether from ourselves or others, is crucial for interpersonal relationships and goes awry in mental disorders. Meaningful evaluations emerge during interactions, where people can support or let each other down. However, such dynamics are difficult to understand comprehensively without quantitative theory and modeling. Here, we implemented an interactive decision-making game wherein two real-life participants evaluated, i.e. graded their approval, for themselves and their play partner. Young adult participants interacted in a multi-level version of the iterated prisoner’s dilemma. Crucially, each participant did not interact with the other directly, but instructed an avatar to do so on their behalf. This allowed increased experimental control while preserving considerable ecological validity. We tested computational models of participants’ evaluations of self and other, based on their beliefs about the quality of their decisions. However such models were less successful than a novel class of models, where self- and other- evaluations depended directly on the combination of self- and other- outcomes. The winning models suggested that for a given participant, evaluation of the self is proportional to how much one’s partner benefits, and vice versa. We found marked self-positivity bias, especially in dyads where neither partner cooperated. This was consistent with attributional theory, negatively evaluating others rather than the self for adverse outcomes. Between participants, self-positivity bias was explained by a reduced weight of one’s partner’s benefits for self-evaluation, hinting that the negative outcome subject to external attribution was the partner’s, rather than one’s own, poor returns. Preliminary analysis also suggested that a reduced sensitivity to others’ outcomes was associated, in this context when participants may have both cooperative and competitive motives, with reduced earnings for the self.  The proposed computational model provides a concise and novel account of self-serving bias in evaluations, clearly observed during interactions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Research suggests that affective responses to exercise and executive function (EF) processes contribute to habitual physical activity (PA) behavior. The purpose of this study is to provide empirical evidence for an emerging cognitive-affect model of PA by investigating the effect of pre-exercise working memory and inhibitory control on exercise-induced affect and perceptions of exertion. \nMethods: Healthy active young adults (N=28, 22.50 ± 3.25 yrs; 75% ♀, BMI = 24.89 ± 4.37 kg·m-2) completed the Flanker and N-back tasks (2 &amp; 3-back) before completing an acute bout (31-min) of moderate-to-vigorous intensity (HR= 158.6 ± 9.9 b·min-1) treadmill running. Feeling Scale (FS) and Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE) were recorded every 3-minutes during the running session. Participants’ prior enjoyment to running was recorded pre-session and the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) was measured immediately following the session. \nResults: Reaction time (RT) measures were used for the cognitive tasks. Participants RT performance during 2-back (β= -0.51, t(23) = -2.51, P &lt; 0.05) and 3-back (β= -0.40, t(24)= -2.14, P&lt; 0.05) predicted more positive FS (i.e., pleasure) during exercise. Flanker RT significantly predicted RPE (β= 0.49, t(21)= 2.24, P &lt; 0.05). Finally, pre-exercise EF was not associated with post-exercise enjoyment (i.e., PACES). \nConclusion: Pre-exercise working memory and inhibitory control performance predicted affect and perceived exertion during exercise. Participants with faster RT to working memory tasks felt significantly more positive and those with faster RT during inhibitory control had significantly lower perceptions of exertion.",

          "abstract": "For three decades, researchers have assessed children’s genetic-essentialism through an “Adoption Task,” probing their beliefs about whether adopted babies grow up to resemble their birthparents or adoptive parents. The present study investigates these beliefs among children who were themselves adopted or donor-conceived (i.e., who share genetic material with neither or one parent, respectively; “ADC”), comparing them with children who were traditionally conceived (i.e., who share genetic material with two parents; “TC”). Children (n = 95, 4-8 years old, 30ADC/65TC, 34M/59F/2NB, 55 White / 35 of color / 5 did not report) completed five trials of an Adoption Task concerning five personal characteristics (hair color, spoken language, personality, interests, and intelligence). Across trials, ADC children made fewer essentialist judgments than TC children (ηp2 = .07); the odds of an essentialist response were threefold greater among TC than ADC participants. Exploratory analyses revealed that with age, children’s essentialist judgments became increasingly differentiated across different characteristics (e.g., increasingly divergent views of the genetic basis of hair color vs. spoken language), and that this differentiation was more pronounced in the ADC than the TC sample. No differences were observed in the genetic-essentialist views of ADC and TC children’s parents, suggesting that the mechanism underlying effects was children’s own sense-making capacities. Whereas nature and nurture are confounded for TC children, these factors are decoupled for ADC children, supporting them in building their causal theories. Cognitive, developmental, and social implications are discussed, along with translational implications for ADC children and their families.",

The present study (N = 44) applied a novel approach – the random generation paradigm – to explore how pre-existing social assumptions determine which information is retrieved from memory when prompted by different social categories. Specifically, we asked participants to imagine people working in certain professions and to say their names out loud. We found that the statistics of the uttered names reflected societal gender stereotypes and environmental statistics of actual people working in these occupations. Importantly, the proportion of female and male names generated for each profession by each participant predicted their performance in a sequential priming task (prime = stereotyped professions, target = female and male faces) better than the environmental statistics or participants’ explicit estimates of gender proportions. Together, these findings offer a new, and widely applicable, method for exploring cultural beliefs and help clarify how social information is sampled from memory when making social judgments.",

Our second experiment (N = 51) found a continued influence effect with a reversed order of accurate and misleading causes (incorrect first; correct second). Thus, both experiments demonstrated misinformation effects. Our third experiment (N = 54) showed that presenting incorrect and correct causes in direct relation reduced the influence of misinformation.

          "authors": "Maurizio Sicorello; Moritz Elsaesser; David R. Kolar",
          "abstract": "Difficulties in emotion regulation are an essential transdiagnostic phenomenon of mental health. While there is extensive literature focusing on emotion regulation difficulties as trait-like constructs, it is inherently a dynamic process that unfolds over time. This raises the need for state-like measures to capture these temporal dynamics in both laboratory and real-world settings, such as the State Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (S-DERS). In the present study, we report the German translation and validation of the S-DERS and present a cross-sectional network analysis to stimulate novel hypotheses for pathways linking single discrete difficulties. A sample of 214 participants underwent a negative mood induction followed by an assessment of the 21-item S-DERS. The results confirm the four-factor structure, reliability, and construct validity of the original English version. Consistent with previous studies on the trait-DERS, we find that an exploratory structural equation modeling approach with extensive cross-loadings is necessary to reach good model fit. Moreover, a model with four correlated factors outperformed a bi-factor and high-order model. This indicates there is no single latent construct of emotion regulation difficulties, but rather four distinct but related constructs for (a) Non-acceptance of Current Emotions, (b) Limited Ability to Modulate Current Emotional and Behavioral Responses, (c) Lack of Awareness of Current Emotions, and (d) Lack of Clarity about Current Emotions. These associations may imply a complex causal interplay between these factors.",

These selection procedures have faced extensive criticism for being biased with respect to socio-demographic factors. However, the different methodologies adopted in prior research to assess target selection have made it difficult to evaluate the actual existence of biases, especially due to difficulties in establishing a comparable benchmark population. To circumvent these limitations, we propose using covert systematic social observations as a method to investigate and evaluate the potential bias of police’s selection procedures. Using the weapon control performed by the Dutch police in Amsterdam in 2022 as a case, we present a method to detect selection biases based on ethnic profiles of citizens that can be reliably applied and has the benefit of allowing for varying police’s selection practices. In sum, given how covert on-site observations offer a realistic picture of how the situation unfolds, we recommend this as a method to examine stop-and-search actions and other bias-prone citizen selection procedures.",

A prominent theme was that of control: Participants want to maintain some sense of autonomy. This factor has not (yet) been included in current technology acceptance models but may be an influential factor in the adoption and acceptance of technology by the elderly. Additionally, participants weighed the impact on their community (rather than themselves) heavily, accepting that adoption of assistive technology will greatly support their family, caregivers and/or the healthcare sector. Emphasizing these two factors may therefore increase the adoption and acceptance of digital assistants, allowing longer aging in place.",

Our goal is to determine if users consider the value of the data to be collected when planning to use such devices. Drawing on theories from media and cognitive psychology, we proposed two causal and two extended models of privacy behavior and conducted a study to compare the evidence for one over the other respectively. We employed a factorial within-between-subject design (NA = 517; NB = 420), considering five types of smart home devices, three levels of endogenous data value (severity of risks), and three levels of exogenous data value (likelihood of risks). Bayes Factor model comparisons of the fit multilevel models indicated extreme relative evidence for the model assuming value-dependent privacy behavior over one predicting deviations from rational data valuation.

          "abstract": "Spending time alone is a virtually inevitable part of daily life that can promote or undermine well-being. Here, we explore how the language used to describe time alone—such as “me-time” “solitude,” or “isolation”—influences how it is perceived and experienced. In Study 1 (N = 500), participants evaluated five common labels for time alone. Descriptive and narrative evidence revealed robust interindividual variability and significant mean differences in how these labels were perceived. Overall, “me-time” was rated most positively, and “isolation” was rated least positively (but not negatively). In Study 2, we experimentally manipulated the linguistic framing of time alone, describing it as either “me-time” or “isolation”. Participants (N = 176) then spent 30 minutes physically alone, without digital interaction. Notably, positive affect increased for participants in the “me-time” condition but decreased for those in the “isolation” condition. Negative affect decreased for both conditions, but the magnitude of the decrease was larger after “me-time”. Additionally, linguistic framing affected what people thought about, but not what they did, while alone. People’s beliefs about being alone improved after “me-time” but not after “isolation.” These findings demonstrate meaningful variation in how people perceive different labels that refer to time alone and suggest that simple linguistic shifts may enhance subjective experiences of time alone.",

          "abstract": "Social disconnection, which includes objective social isolation and subjective loneliness, is associated with increased risk of physical health problems and early mortality. The hypothesized nature in which social disconnection operates was recently outlined in the theory of social homeostasis. The theory proposes that individuals strive to maintain an optimal level of social connection, with loneliness serving an adaptive purpose by motivating social reconnection and preventing prolonged isolation. Social homeostasis may be especially relevant for explaining how social disconnection can evolve and change over time in various forms of psychopathology. In this paper we developed a mathematical model based on the theory of social homeostasis to help explain social disconnection in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, two mental disorders characterized by social functioning impairments. First, we formalized the theory of social homeostasis as a set of differential equations. We then implemented the equations computationally using simulations. From there, we simulated three examples of the model, including an example characterizing a theoretical healthy individual and examples characterizing theoretical individuals with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The healthy simulation successfully reproduced the predicted dynamics of social homeostasis, while the bipolar and schizophrenia simulations revealed distinct patterns of social dysfunction. By formalizing social homeostasis through differential equations, we provide a more precise framework for understanding how social disconnection can evolve over time as a dynamical system. We also discuss the model’s implications for future psychopathology research and highlight potential avenues for theory and model refinement.",

          "abstract": "Emotional crying is a complex and multifaceted expression that is frequently observed in humans. Its communicative effects have been recently studied in more detail. However, many studies focus on just one specific feature of emotional crying, most often emotional tears, neglecting the complex nature of the expression. Reports about crying episodes observe that tears most commonly occur in combination with other features such as facial expressions, vocalizations, gestures, and varied temporal dynamics. This shortcoming in research is mostly explained by a lack of adequately controlled stimuli depicting different crying features. Here, we provide a solution for this problem by introducing the Dynamic Posed Emotional Crying Behavior Database (DPECBD), an openly available resource of 500 videos depicting 10 actors showing variations in tears intensity, facial expression intensity, vocalizations, gestures, and temporal dynamics and the combination thereof. We present two studies (N = 2729) providing evidence for the validity of the database. In addition, we developed a static supplementary resource (DPECBD-S) with 70 pictures depicting variations in tears and facial expression intensity that was successfully validated across two studies (N = 601). Overall, our findings support the validity of this new stimulus set that closes a gap in the research on the interpersonal effects of emotional crying.

Atypical lateralization in auditory processing has been widely accepted associated with impaired reading skills in alphabetic languages. However, whether Chinese adults with reading difficulty (RD) history presents atypical lateralization in auditory processing similar to those in alphabetic languages remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Chinese adults with poor reading would show lateralization of neural oscillations during auditory sampling. \nDesign: Thirty-two adults with self-report RD history and 44 adults without RD history were screened out by Chinese Adult Reading History Questionnaire (CARHQ). Reading accuracy, phonological accuracy, and rapid automatized naming (RAN) were assessed in all the participants. Auditory steady state cortical responses (ASSR) modulated at 10-80 Hz was recorded during a 6s white noise. Time-frequency power and phase synchrony indices were used to measure induced oscillatory power and synchrony of beta and gamma oscillations related to phonemic processing. \nResults: Adults with RD history performed worse than adults without RD history in reading accuracy and phonological accuracy. Also, adults with RD history showed atypical rightward lateralization in the gamma band, whereas the adults without RD history showed leftward lateralization. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) in the left hemisphere negatively correlated with reading accuracy in adults with RD history, while left hemisphere ERSP lateralization positively correlated with phonological accuracy in adults without RD history. The inter-trial phase synchrony (ITPS) in the right hemisphere also correlated with reading accuracy in adults with RD history. \nConclusions: The present study revealed auditory lateralization deficits in Chinese adults with RD history. \nKeywords: Reading difficulty history, Chinese adults, Auditory processing, Lateralization, Event-related spectral perturbation.",

          "abstract": "Theories of cognitive development rely on implicit or explicit causal assumptions from developmental data. While powerful in their attempt to account for within-individual developmental change, causally testing such theories is difficult. One method for enhancing our knowledge might be to look for exogenous changes affecting mainly some cognitive abilities and to observe the developmental outcomes over further abilities. Focal cortical lesions sustained in childhood represent one informative instance of such changes. Here we test the implications of theories of cognitive development by studying a sample of 464 individuals who suffered focal cortical lesion in childhood to either the right frontal or right temporal lobes. Children had follow-up cognitive assessments done 8.5 years later. The key findings showed sustained long-term deficits in fluid abilities, but no developmental cascade of a reduction in abilities over time. Suffering a lesion to the right frontal cortex, despite causing a drop in fluid or abstract intelligence, does not transfer over to crystallized or knowledge-based abilities over development. The implication is that there is no transfer between these abilities when an exogeneous change affects early fluid ability. These results can be seen as powerful for testing developmental theories of cognition against their causal assumptions.",

          "authors": "Haena Kim; Alicia Liu; Yuan Chang Leong",
          "abstract": "Perceptual judgments are often influenced by goals and preferences, resulting in biased judgements that deviate from objective reality. When presented with ambiguous images, observers are biased to report seeing images associated with rewards. However, it remains unclear whether this is driven by a bias toward stimuli that people are motivated to see (i.e., desirability) or stimuli that are motivationally significant (i.e., relevance). As rewards are both desirable and motivationally relevant, these effects are not easily dissociated in a reward context. This study investigates the effects of desirability and relevance on perceptual judgments in an aversive context involving financial losses. Across two experiments conducted between 2023-2024, participants completed a visual categorization task where ambiguous stimuli were associated with a large financial loss. Participants’ perceptual judgments were biased away from stimuli associated with the loss, indicating a desirability bias. Drift diffusion model analyses revealed that this bias was due to a shift in the starting point of evidence accumulation, such that participants required more evidence to commit to a response associated with an undesirable outcome. The bias in starting point correlated with individual differences in punishment sensitivity but not reward sensitivity, highlighting how individual traits shape motivational effects on perceptual decisions. Results replicated across an in-lab sample and a larger online sample. Altogether, our study provides robust evidence of a desirability bias in perceptual decisions involving financial losses, identifying both the computational mechanisms and trait-level differences that influence how people decide what they see when faced with the prospect of undesirable outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Long COVID remains a pressing health concern among Americans, with current data suggesting that 45% of those infected by COVID-19 experience at least one symptom of Long COVID. Veterans are a particularly at-risk population due to their unique demographic characteristics and lived experiences. Despite this, there has been a lack of treatment development for Long COVID that targets mental health symptoms and is veteran-specific. There is a need for effective treatments to help veterans cope with a Long COVID diagnosis and recovery. This quality improvement project aims to gain insight into the lived experiences and mental health needs of veterans with Long COVID to help inform future treatment development. A sample of 21 veterans (57% Male, 67% Black, 43% Hispanic) participated in qualitative interviews where they were asked 23 questions about their experiences living with Long COVID and seeking medical treatment, as well as their ongoing mental health needs. Qualitative data was extracted from these interviews and analyzed. Four main themes were identified: interpersonal concerns and challenges with social interaction; difficulties with day-to-day living; barriers and facilitators to accessing medical treatment; and mental health effects and attitudes towards psychotherapy. Veterans described significant impairments in functioning, as well as feelings of isolation and loneliness. These findings demonstrate the need for a psychotherapeutic intervention that can facilitate interpersonal connection, improve functioning, and decrease psychiatric symptoms.",

          "abstract": "The network theory proposes to conceptualize mental disorders as networks of interacting symptoms. While clinical expertise could offer a valuable perspective on this theory and its applications, little is known about mental health professionals´ attitudes. In an online survey, mental health professionals rated their agreement with propositions of the network theory and evaluated the acceptability and appropriateness of possible applications. The 257 participating mental health professionals largely agreed with the network theory’s proposition regarding the phenomenology of mental disorders and regarding treatment effects. Appraisal of the network theory regarding the aetiology, regarding important treatment targets and regarding acceptability and appropriateness of possible applications was mixed. A background in cognitive behavioural therapy, and previous knowledge of the network theory were positively associated with agreement. The core assumptions of the network approach seem to resonate with mental health professionals, while consequences for the diagnosis and treatment for mental disorders were questioned.",

          "abstract": "Prior knowledge has long been known to influence retention of newly learned information. In particular, known semantic associations across items facilitate subsequent retrieval for these items. However, whether distinct forms of semantic relations vary in the influence they exert on memory remains unclear. We took inspiration from the field of concepts and categories and compared two major types of semantic relations between concepts: taxonomic (e.g., dog-bird) and thematic (e.g., dog-leash) relations. In Experiment 1, we show that cued recall for word pairs with thematic relations was faster and more accurate, followed by pairs with taxonomic relations and finally unrelated pairs. We hypothesized that thematically related words are more quickly and more accurately retrieved because they are more accessible in one’s semantic memory. To test this, we designed a second experiment where participants encoded word pairs of the same relations as in Experiment 1 and completed a forced-choice associative memory test with options sharing different semantic relations to the cue. In addition to corroborating the findings of Experiment 1, Experiment 2 demonstrated that participants were more prone to incorrectly guessing a thematic alternative. We conclude that thematic relations outperform taxonomic relations in driving memory performance and speculate that this may result from their dominance in organizing episodic memory.",

Less well understood is how temperament traits co-develop from adolescence to young adulthood. We characterized how trajectories of effortful control, frustration, affiliation, and shyness in adolescence to formed multi-trajectory groups. As these groups could provide novel information about pathways to psychopathology, we examined their associations with adulthood psychopathology and polygenic risk scores (PRS). Participants were drawn from a larger longitudinal cohort (N=1412). Effortful control, frustration, affiliation, and shyness were measured four times from ages 10-23. Adulthood internalizing, externalizing, and alcohol problems were measured at ages 24-27. PRS with continuous shrinkage priors were calculated. Group-based multi-trajectory analyses showed a five-group model fit best, including high-risk, undercontrolled, low-risk, overcontrolled, and low affiliation groups that differed on both the levels and slopes of temperament traits over time. We found specific linkages between the low affiliation group and problematic alcohol use, the high-risk group and depression symptoms, and the high-risk and undercontrolled groups with externalizing problems. The undercontrolled group showed the highest, and overcontrolled the lowest, externalizing PRS scores. Findings shed light on developmental patterns of temperament in adolescence-to-adulthood and unique combinations of temperament trajectories with specific linkages to etiologic factors and psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "Despite the last decade’s development of optogenetic methods for artificially manipulating engrams, and subsequent claims that there is a consensus that memories are stored in ensembles of synaptic connections, it remains unclear to what degree there truly is unanimity within the neuroscientific community about the neurophysiological basis of long-term memory. We surveyed 312 neuroscientists, comprising one cohort of experts on engram research and another of general neuroscientists, to assess this community’s views on how memories are stored. While 70.5% of participants agreed that long-term memories are primarily maintained by neuronal connectivity patterns and synaptic strengths, there was no clear consensus on which specific neurophysiological features or scales are critical for memory storage. Despite this, the median probability estimate that any long-term memories could potentially be extracted from a static snapshot of brain structure was around 40%, which was also the estimate for whether a successful whole brain emulation could theoretically be created from the structure of a preserved brain. When predicting the future feasibility of whole brain emulation, the median participant estimated this would be achieved for C. elegans around 2045, mice around 2065, and humans around 2125. Notably, neither research background nor expertise level significantly influenced views on whether memories could be extracted from brain structure alone. Our findings suggest that while most neuroscientists believe memories are stored in structural features of the brain, fundamental questions about the precise physical basis of memory storage remain unresolved. These findings have important implications for both theoretical neuroscience and the development of technologies aimed at preserving or extracting memory-related information.",

          "abstract": "Objective: This study aims at improving dropout and treatment non-response prevention by optimizing the performance of models for their prediction through the integration of item-level data. Method: Routine data from 1277 patients (M = 36.95, SD = 13.64; 64.77% female) treated at [masked version] was used to train and evaluate 20 machine-learning algorithms. Measures included sociodemographic information, Outcome Questionnaire-30 (OQ-30), Questionnaire for the Evaluation of Psychotherapy (FEP–2), Emotional Well-Being Questionnaire (EMO), Symptom Checklist (SCL–90–R), and the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP-32). Model training was conducted using nested cross-validation, and five ensemble models were formed to enhance predictions by combining algorithms based on performance and correlation metrics. Final predictions were evaluated in a holdout sample, with predictor scores at total, item, and combined levels. Results: A model using item-level data achieved the highest performance for dropout prediction (F1-score = 0.87, Brier score = 0.0529, balanced accuracy = 0.88) in a holdout sample. For treatment non-response, an ensemble model trained on item-level data provided the best results (F1-score = 0.60, Brier score = 0.1646, balanced accuracy = 0.72). Conclusion: This study demonstrates the clinical value of using item-level data to enhance predictive modeling for dropout and treatment non-response. Integrating such models into clinical feedback systems could help identify at-risk patients and reduce dropout and non–response rates.\nKeywords: dropout, treatment non-response, prevention, machine learning, prediction.",

          "abstract": "Combined action observation and motor imagery (AOMI) training has been shown to facilitate motor skill performance, but limited research has explored its effectiveness on motor learning and possible moderating factors for the intervention. This study examined the influence of model type on the effectiveness of AOMI training for novices learning an Ankle Pick takedown. Twenty-eight novice participants were randomly assigned to AOMI training that displayed footage of a self-model (AOMISELF) or an other-model (AOMIOTHER). A motor learning design incorporating pre-test (Day 1), acquisition (Days 2-6), post-test (Day 7), and retention-test (Day 14) was utilised). Motor skill performance, self-efficacy and mental representation structures were recorded as measures of learning. There were no significant differences between the training conditions across all twelve kinematics measures of motor skill performance. Self-efficacy scores increased for all training conditions over time. Both the AOMIOTHER and Control conditions led to improved functional changes in mental representation structures while the structures for the AOMISELF condition moved further away from the reference structure over time. Collectively, the largely null findings suggest that physical practice is the main driver of motor adaptations for this complex motor skill at these early stages of learning. However, the findings also suggest model type may be an important factor for novices using AOMI training. Therefore, it is recommended for future research to explore different modeling approaches, such as mixed-modeling, when designing AOMI interventions for sport.",

          "abstract": "Speech perception remains challenging for cochlear-implant recipients in conditions containing background noise. Modifications to the sound processing strategy could improve the transmission of information by the cochlear implant, alleviating speech perception difficulties in noise. One such modification, the temporal integrator processing strategy (TIPS), uses a model of temporal masking to identify and remove stimulation pulses that are unlikely to be perceived. In a previous investigation, TIPS significantly improved the perception of CIS-processed speech in the presence of speech-shaped noise (Lamping et al. 2020). This study extends the previous investigation to include conditions that better reflect everyday listening through two pre-registered double-blind within-participant experiments. The first experiment tested speech perception with CIS and TIPS and found that speech intelligibility in speech-shaped and multi-talker noise was unaffected by TIPS processing, although TIPS-processed stimuli achieved slightly lower quality ratings than their CIS counterparts in quiet (p = 0.044). The second experiment compared TIPS to ACE and found that both speech intelligibility in a multi-talker noise and speech quality ratings in quiet were unaffected by TIPS processing. Given that TIPS removes a substantial number of stimulation pulses, TIPS was estimated to result in net power savings between 22% and 42%, without compromising speech perception in the presence of background noise.",

However, in research involving clinical samples, the impact of increasingly rigorous reliability standards on factors such as sample generalizability, patient vs. control effect sizes, and effect sizes for within-group correlations with external variables is unclear. This study systematically evaluated whether different ERP reliability cutoffs impacted these factors in psychosis. Error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) were assessed during a modified flanker task in 97 patients with psychosis and 104 healthy comparison participants, who also completed measures of cognition and psychiatric symptoms. ERP reliability cutoffs had notably different effects on the factors considered. A recommended reliability cutoff of .80 resulted in sample bias due to systematic exclusion of patients with relatively few task errors, lower reported psychiatric symptoms, and higher levels of cognitive functioning. ERP score reliability lower than .80 resulted in generally smaller between- and within-group effect sizes, likely misrepresenting effect sizes. Imposing rigorous ERP reliability standards in studies of psychotic disorders might exclude high-functioning patients, which raises important considerations for the generalizability of clinical ERP research.",

Although individuals can monitor and report their own attentional state, it remains unclear whether these self-reports are primarily driven by estimation of performance or external cues. In this study, sixty-one participants completed a probabilistic reinforcement learning task in which they made binary choices to maximize monetary rewards. Due to the probabilistic nature of the task, participants could make accurate choices, such as selecting the option most likely to yield a reward, yet still observe a negative outcome. During task performance, participants rated their attentiveness at random intervals using a visual analogue scale. Using Bayesian regression analysis and computational reinforcement learning model, we found that self-reported attention was more strongly influenced by external outcomes (reward delivery) than by task performance estimates. Furthermore, we examined the causal association between task performance and the experience of attentiveness. Time-lagged analysis suggested that attentiveness ratings did not predict future performance, and rather were only influenced by reward history.  These findings suggest that individuals may rely more on external cues, such as rewards, rather than internal assessments of performance when reporting their level of attention.",

          "abstract": "This study examined the role of sleep in the consolidation and generalization of fear learning. 31 healthy, young adult participants (16 in the wake group and 15 in the sleep group) underwent a fear acquisition procedure in which a geometrical figure imposed on a background image was repeatedly presented and paired with a mild electric shock, making it a conditioned stimulus (a CS+). Another geometrical figure imposed on another background image was also repeatedly presented but never paired with the shock, making it a safety stimulus (a CS-). After a ~three-hour delay interval containing either a two-hour nap opportunity or an equivalent amount of time spent awake, participants performed a fear memory and generalization test. Here, participants viewed four different stimuli: the CS+ and CS- seen before, as well as two novel stimuli composed of the same two geometrical figures seen before imposed on novel background images. This design allowed us to examine a) whether sleep consolidates the original fear memory and b) whether sleep affects the degree of generalization of fear learning to when the originally fear-eliciting stimulus is presented in a novel context. Results revealed no group differences for either the consolidation or generalization of fear learning in either of our outcome measures (skin conductance responses, subjective ratings of unpleasantness, shock expectancy ratings, or explicit memory performance). Previous work on the effect of sleep on consolidation and generalization of fear learning has revealed mixed findings and there is currently limited evidence for sleep having an effect in either direction.",

          "abstract": "Accurate assessment of societal change relies on robust metrics, yet the reliability of commonly used indicators is uncertain. We conducted an expert-elicitation-guided (n = 24) comprehensive audit of 99 indicators—including 37 pre-selected and 62 expert-nominated markers—across key domains such as climate, economy, public health, and peace/war. Each indicator was evaluated based on definability, quantifiability, data availability, global representativeness, transparency, and temporal resolution. Our audit revealed that only 29.7% of pre-selected indicators and 32.3% of expert-suggested indicators met all quality criteria. Furthermore, the perceived importance of a domain was inversely related to the quality of its available indicators. Moreover, direct measures tended to score higher in quality than composite indices. These findings highlight significant gaps in the metrics used to track societal change, raising concerns about the data informing policy and public understanding. We underscore the need to develop more precise, transparent, globally representative, temporally precise indicators to effectively assess human progress.",

          "abstract": "Background: Reliable and specific biomarkers that can distinguish Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) from commonly co-occurring Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are lacking, causing misses and delays in diagnosis, and reducing access to interventions and quality of life. Aims: To examine whether an innovative, brief (one-minute), videogame method called Computerised Assessment of Motor Imitation (CAMI) can identify ASD-specific imitation differences compared to neurotypical and ADHD children. Method: This cross-sectional study used CAMI alongside standardised parent-report (SRS-2) and observational measures of autism (ADOS-2), ADHD (Conners), and motor ability (PANESS). Sample included a total of 183 children aged 7-13 years who had ADHD (without ASD), had ASD (with ADHD: ASD+ADHD, and without ADHD: ASD-only), and were neurotypical. Results: Regardless of co-occurring ADHD, ASD children showed poorer CAMI performance than neurotypical children (p&lt;.0001, Adjusted R2=.28), whereas ADHD and neurotypical children showed similar CAMI performance. Receiver Operating Curve and Support Vector Machine analyses showed that CAMI distinguishes ASD from both NT (80% true positive rate) and ADHD children (70% true positive rate) with a high success rate significantly above chance. Among autistic children, poor CAMI performance was associated with increased autism traits, particularly ADOS measures of social affect and restricted and repetitive behaviours (Adjusted R2=.23), but not with ADHD traits or motor ability. Conclusions: Four levels of analyses – diagnostic group comparisons, dimensional associations, and classification metrics based on Receiver Operating Curve and Support Vector Machine – confirm that poor imitation measured by the low-cost and scalable CAMI method specifically distinguishes ASD not only from neurotypical development but also from commonly co-occurring ADHD.",

          "abstract": "Life events have been theorized to cause personality trait changes. However, people differ in their personality trait trajectories after experiencing important life events. Although several studies have examined the sources of these individual differences, a replicable set of variables explaining individual differences in the reaction to major life events has yet to be identified. In a systematic literature review (Study 1), we integrated existing evidence on potentially important moderators of event-related changes in the Big Five personality traits (23 studies, Ntotal = 82,374). This review showed that (1) only a limited set of moderators has been linked to individual differences in event-related personality trait changes so far, and (2) that there are vast differences in the methods used to examine these effects across studies, complicating meta-analytical integration. To overcome these limitations, we conducted a coordinated data analysis (Study 2), generating novel and robust evidence for associations between a broad set of psychological, demographic, event-related, and contextual characteristics and event-related personality trait changes. Across eight large-scale panel studies (Ntotal = 90,934, Nobs = 391,024), we found several replicable moderators of event-related personality changes. For example, age and psychological variables such as life satisfaction moderated personality trait changes across datasets. Even though the effect sizes of the moderators were (very) small (bMedian = 0.007, ΔR2Median = 0.16%), the findings of the coordinated data analysis contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of event-related personality change, critical for the advancement of contemporary personality development theories.",

          "authors": "Zijian Yang",
          "abstract": "The relationship between the cortisol awakening response (CAR) and individual mental health remains debated. To address this, the present study introduces CAR variability across multiple days as a novel indicator, aiming to resolve inconsistencies in prior findings often caused by situational factors affecting the traditional mean CAR measure. We investigate the association between CAR variability and both trait anxiety and psychological resilience. In Experiment 1, we reduced CAR variability by minimizing sleep efficiency variation under natural sleep conditions, finding a significant positive correlation between CAR variability and trait anxiety scores. This suggests that lower CAR variability in stable conditions correlates with lower trait anxiety. In Experiment 2, CAR variability was increased through total sleep deprivation, revealing a significant positive correlation between CAR variability and psychological resilience. This indicates that greater CAR variability in dynamic conditions corresponds with higher psychological resilience. In contrast, CAR mean levels across both experiments showed no significant associations with either trait anxiety or psychological resilience. These findings suggest that, beyond mean CAR levels, CAR variability may serve as a more effective physiological indicator of mental health. Considering CAR variability across multiple days is crucial for understanding how individuals adapt to daily life stressors and challenges, providing new perspectives and potential avenues for promoting mental health and developing effective intervention strategies.",

Currently, there are limited treatment options available that effectively treat FM symptoms. Psilocybin-assisted therapy (PAT) is an emerging combined drug-therapy intervention, but no studies to-date have investigated PAT for FM. Here, we report findings from an open-label, proof-of-concept trial of PAT for FM (N=5; NCT05128162). In conjunction with psychotherapy (two preparatory, four integration sessions), participants received two doses of oral psilocybin (15mg and 25mg) delivered two weeks apart. Regarding safety (primary outcome), there were transient elevations of blood pressure or heart rate during dosing which normalized by the end of treatment, with no serious adverse events. Four of five participants reported transient headaches following dosing. Compared to baseline, participants reported clinically meaningful improvements in the following secondary outcomes one month following their second psilocybin dose (reported as Cohen’s d): pain severity (d=-2.1, 95% CI[-3.7 to -0.49]), pain interference (d=-1.8, 95% CI [-3.27 to -0.24]), and sleep disturbance (d=-2.5, 95% CI [-4.21 to -0.75]). Using the Patient Global Impression of Change, one participant reported their symptoms “very much improved,” two reported “much improved,” and two reported “minimally improved.” Compared to baseline, there were improvements in the following exploratory outcomes after the intervention: FM symptoms, anxiety, and fatigue. This small open-label trial preliminarily supports that PAT is well-tolerated by people with FM, establishing a basis for larger randomized controlled trials.",

          "abstract": "The current child and adolescent mental health crisis necessitates both empirical and theoretical innovation. This review presents a new framework conceptualising mental health and wellbeing (MHW) neurodevelopment in childhood and adolescence - The Neurodevelopmental Theory of Mental Health and Wellbeing Capacities (NDeTeC) - formulated from a transdiagnostic preventative perspective. The NDeTeC specifies two key neuro-cognitive-affective capacities underpinning MHW, together with their associated brain networks, positioned in a developmentally fine-grained and socially-contextualised perspective on MHW. The first capacity focuses on self-regulation and identifies neurodevelopmental processes underlying adaptive managing of thoughts, emotions and behaviours, including emotional awareness and regulation of distraction, reactivity, rumination and worry. This capacity is associated with the intertwined activity in salience-executive-default mode networks, reward network and the Hypothalamus-Pituitary Axis. The second capacity, called the self-world capacity, specifies and integrates relational processes of MHW underpinning a connected, flexible, ethically-grounded and purposeful sense of self associated with shared humanity, connectedness and prosocial agency. This capacity is linked to activity in the theory of mind, empathy, prosociality and default mode networks. The review outlines how the NDeTeC framework can enable integration of different MHW constructs and associated approaches to guide improvements in long-term MHW support for children and adolescents.",

The goal of the present study was to investigate temporal relationships between the intensity/frequency (I/F) of use and impairment related to alcohol and substance use and SI in a longitudinal BSD cohort.\n\nMethods: Participants with BDI (n=565), BDII (n=162), and BD NOS (n=61) were included (median enrollment=72 months). Alcohol and substance use were measured using a modified version of the AUDIT administered every 6 months. SI was measured every 2 months using item 9 from the PHQ-9. Linear mixed effects models tested concurrent associations and Dynamic Structural Equation Models tested prospective associations between alcohol and substance use I/F and impairment with SI. \n\nResults: Cocaine I/F and alcohol and substance use impairment were concurrently associated with SI. When a person had more frequent and intense cannabis use compared to average, they had higher SI at the next timepoint. When individuals experienced more alcohol and substance use impairment than average, they had higher SI at the next timepoint. \n\nConclusions: Both alcohol and substance use appear to increase SI for those with BSDs, though in different ways.",

To address this crisis, implementing evidence-based, single-session interventions for individuals seeking treatment may provide timely relief. StrongMinds—a mental health charity organization serving youth and adults in Uganda—piloted a Single-Session Consultation (SSC) service for new treatment-seekers with elevated depression symptoms. To optimize its reach and fit with StrongMinds’ service delivery model, the SSC was delivered by trained lay providers in both individual and group-based formats. Within two months (September-October 2023), the SSC was delivered to 200 Ugandan adults with elevated depression symptoms (ages 16-86; 73% female) upon initial outreach for StrongMinds’ group psychotherapy services. SSC clients reported significant improvements in hopelessness and depression symptoms at 2-week (ds = -0.73, -1.12) and 1-month follow-ups (ds = -0.96, -1.44), while waiting for group psychotherapy. SSC clients reported high SSC\nsatisfaction (M = 4.47/5), and intervention effects did not significantly differ by delivery format (i.e., individual vs. group format). Results suggest the SSC’s acceptability, feasibility, and utility as a low-intensity, scalable intervention for adolescents and adults in Uganda on waiting lists for longer-term psychotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Background: Thought suppression is suggested as a causal factor in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as it can lead to a paradoxical increase in intrusive thoughts. However, the neural mechanisms through which obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) influence thought suppression, particularly in the context of attentional bias toward negatively valenced stimuli, remain unclear. We hypothesized that OCS would predict increased recruitment of frontal inhibitory neurocircuitry during the suppression of negative words and that this would be mediated by an attentional bias toward these stimuli. \nMethods: EEG was recorded from 48 non-clinical participants tasked with directed forgetting of negative and neutral words. We examined the influence of OCS on neural correlates of thought suppression, specifically fronto-parahippocampal beta-1 (13-18 Hz) synchronisation and alpha (8-12 Hz) activity in the parahippocampal cortex. The mediating role of attentional bias, measured via the late positive potential (LPP) following word was assessed using a mediated moderation model.\nResults: OCS predicted enhanced fronto-parahippocampal beta-1 synchronisation when instructed to forget negative words. This effect was mediated by attentional bias to negative stimuli, but only in individuals with higher levels of OCS. \nConclusions: Individuals with higher OCS exhibit compensatory engagement of frontal inhibitory mechanisms when attempting to suppress negative emotional stimuli. This compensatory activity is influenced by both attentional bias to negative stimuli and the severity of OCS, highlighting a neural mechanism that may contribute to the persistence of intrusive thoughts in OCD.",

          "abstract": "Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) offers advantages over retrospective questionnaires by reducing recall bias and capturing rapid symptom dynamics, and it is increasingly used to measure depression symptoms. However, few depression symptom measures are validated for EMA use in the manner expected for traditional questionnaires. Therefore, the current study examined the internal consistency, longitudinal stability, and convergent validity of the Mobile Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (MPHQ-9), a version of the PHQ-9 modified for EMA. Depressed participants (N = 280; Female = 83.93%; White = 79.29%) completed the MPHQ-9 three times daily for 90 days. Data from the first and last 2 weeks were analyzed to align with a pre-study PHQ-9 and post-study PHQ-9 and Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms - Expanded Version (IDAS-II). The MPHQ-9 demonstrated fair to substantial adjusted item-total correlations (r = 0.42–0.83), often exceeding the PHQ-9 (r = 0.39–0.72). Inter-item correlations ranged from slight to substantial for the MPHQ-9 (r = 0.26–0.87) and were typically larger than the correlations observed for the PHQ-9 (r = 0.11–0.71). Cronbach’s alpha coefficients were substantial for both the MPHQ-9 (.91) and PHQ-9 (.81). The MPHQ-9 showed moderate and superior stability (r = .69), compared to the slight stability of the PHQ-9 (r = .39). There was moderate agreement between the MPHQ-9 and both the PHQ-9 (r = .71) and the IDAS-II General Depression subscale (r = .65). This study provides initial validation of the MPHQ-9 and suggests it may be a better measure of depression symptomatology than the PHQ-9 in some contexts.",

This systematic literature review identifies and narratively synthesizes longitudinal studies of risk and protective factors for loneliness in children and adolescents aged below 25 years. A systematic literature search was conducted in October 2023 using PsycINFO and MEDLINE, resulting in k = 398 articles, with k = 105 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. The examined factors included demographic (e.g., gender), socio-economic (e.g., income sufficiency), social (e.g., peer acceptance), mental health (e.g., depression), physical health (e.g., disabilities), health behavior (e.g., sport participation), and psychological factors (e.g., shyness). Additionally, adverse childhood experiences (e.g., child maltreatment) and environmental factors (e.g., neighborhood characteristics) were investigated. Despite the wide range of potential risk and protective factors examined, relatively few studies provided strong evidence for a prospective association with loneliness. Risk factors that were consistently identified across multiple longitudinal studies included low peer acceptance and peer victimization, depression, social anxiety, internalizing symptoms, low self-esteem, shyness, and neuroticism. Additional replication is required to evaluate factors that have shown significant associations with loneliness in only a limited number of longitudinal studies (e.g., aggression).",

          "abstract": "The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has long been associated with economic and social decision-making in neuroimaging studies. Several debates question whether different ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) and dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) regions have specific functions or whether there is a gradient supporting social and non-social cognition. Here, we tested an unusually large sample of rare participants with focal damage to mPFC (N = 33), individuals with lesions elsewhere (N = 17), and healthy controls (N = 71) (total N = 121). Participants completed a temporal discounting task to estimate their baseline discounting preferences before learning the preferences of two other people, one who was more temporally impulsive and one more patient. We used Bayesian computational models to estimate baseline discounting and susceptibility to social influence after learning others’ economic preferences. mPFC damage increased susceptibility to impulsive social influence compared to healthy controls and increased overall susceptibility to social influence compared to those with lesions elsewhere. Importantly, voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) of computational parameters showed that this heightened susceptibility to social influence was attributed specifically to damage to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC, area 9). In contrast, lesions in the vmPFC (areas 13 and 25) and ventral striatum were associated with a preference for seeking more immediate rewards. We show that the dmPFC is causally implicated in susceptibility to social influence, with distinct ventral portions of mPFC involved in temporal discounting.",

          "abstract": "Time series are becoming a common type of data in psychological research, allowing us to study the dynamics of human functioning at an unprecedented level of granularity. Much of the current modelling work focuses on variations of vector autoregressive (VAR) models, in which variables are predicted by themselves and other variables at previous time points. An alternative to these models are Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which model time series with a process that switches between a number of latent states, each associated with a different response distribution. Despite the fact that HMMs are often both theoretically interesting and can provide a better model fit for many time series, HMMs have rarely been used to model psychological time series. The reason for this has been the lack of software to fit HMMs in a multilevel setting, which is required both to make estimation feasible in a realistic applied setting, and to quantify and account for heterogeneity between subjects. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing multilevel HMMs and their estimation in a Bayesian setting; we evaluate with numerical experiments how well these models can be estimated in settings corresponding to empirical research using the R package mHMMbayes; and we provide a fully reproducible tutorial that guides the reader through all steps of model selection, model checking, and interpretation using an openly available dataset on emotion dynamics. Finally, we discuss the potential positive impact of adding multilevel HMMs to the time series modelling toolbox and discuss directions for further methodological improvements.",

          "authors": "Manda Fischer; Morris Moscovitch; Claude Alain",
          "abstract": "How does memory influence auditory perception, and what are the underlying mechanisms that drive these interactions? Most empirical investigations on the neural correlates of memory-guided perception have used static visual tasks creating a bias in the literature that contrasts with recent research highlighting the dynamic nature of memory retrieval. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to track the retrieval of auditory associative memories in a cue-target paradigm. Participants (N=64) listened to real-world soundscapes (cue) that were either predictive of an upcoming target tone or nonpredictive. Three key results emerged: First, targets were detected faster when embedded in predictive than in nonpredictive soundscapes (memory-guided perceptual benefit). Second, changes in theta and alpha power differentiated soundscape contexts that were predictive from nonpredictive contexts at two distinct temporal intervals from cue onset (early - 950 ms peak for theta and alpha, and late - 1650 ms peak for alpha only). Third, early theta activity in the left anterior temporal lobe was correlated with memory-guided perceptual benefits. Together, these findings underscore the role of distinct neural processes at different time points during cued retrieval. By emphasizing temporal sensitivity and isolating cue-related activity, we reveal a two-stage retrieval mechanism that advances understanding of how memory influences auditory perception.",

          "abstract": "Environmental educators and activists mediate children’s meaning-making of nature, environmental and climate change issues. However, little is known about children’s meaning-making of the educators and activists themselves or how the meaning-making is expressed. This qualitative research used thematic analysis to examine 30 storybooks on the environment &amp; climate change authored by 10-15 year olds, to understand the portrayal of characters based on the environmental educators and activists the children had interacted with. Data from interviews, focus group discussions, student reflections and program blogposts were collected and coded to confirm understanding from the storybooks. Results show that in 12 of the books, the young authors had introduced protagonists, supporting characters or minor characters inspired by the environmental educators and activists they had interacted with.  These characters were adults who were different from the other adults in the storybooks. They were first and foremost, Indian, were kind &amp; caring, were experts who taught in child-friendly &amp; democratic ways and created a proto-conscientization in the other characters in the books. This proto-conscientization included an understanding of systems of power and oppression which then fuelled political or community based action by the characters in the books. This was a significant contribution to the process of decolonizing eco and climate fiction where representations of people from the Global South is often missing or reductive.",

          "abstract": "This study examines disinformation in Colombia through the case of journalist Inna Afinogenova from Russian media outlet ActualidadRT, focusing on her Twitter activity. It investigates the role of inorganic accounts in amplifying political disinformation using the \"information disorder\" framework. Data were collected from her most viral posts over 54 months (January 2017 - July 2021), and users interacting with them were classified as organic or inorganic, with further subdivisions, such as: inorganic, highly suspicious, suspicious, and organic. An unsupervised machine learning algorithm and a theoretical framework jointly identified abnormal behaviour, revealing that 11.25% of users exhibited confirmed inorganic behaviour. This indicates coordinated inauthentic behaviour, a common feature of disinformation campaigns, though the study does not explore any direct connection to RT or the Russian government. Methodologically, the study advances by analysing retweets instead of hashtags and corroborating results through machine learning. It underscores the impact of manipulated traffic on public discourse in Colombia.",

          "abstract": "This briefing note explores the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for quantitative social science. It provides an overview of recent advancements, outlines possible future scenarios, and examines the opportunities and challenges that AI introduces to the field. Opportunities include substantial gains in productivity across the research process: notably in data analysis, visualisation, and dissemination. Researchers could thus spend more time focusing on research and less time on administrative or repetitive tasks. Other opportunities include using AI algorithms to analyse the increasing vastness of data obtained in surveys; using AI to improve prediction; and efficiency gains in survey or experimental design/deployment. Challenges include the potential for a vast increase in low-quality publications, especially if academic incentives remain misaligned toward quantity rather than quality of research outputs, as well as the broader existential risks AI may pose. We also include a list of resources and additional reading. This brief was written jointly by the authors; readers can compare with briefs entirely written by Generative AI (GenAI) systems, and listen to an AI generated podcast based on this brief here: https://osf.io/ew6z8/. As AI reshapes research and society, social scientists are needed to understand AI's implications and deploy AI to better achieve our goals.",

          "abstract": "A four-phase Hackathon of Educational Materials was constructed to enable instructors to take existing course materials and integrate, rather than concatenate, new content and activities. The \"integrate, not concatenate\" (InC) approach was pilot tested utilizing the Hackathon, with ethical reasoning content and activities to be integrated into courses in degree programs for mathematics, statistics, operations research, and data science in one undergraduate department. The InC Hackathon of Educational Materials phases for ethical reasoning coverage were: Hack 1 (H1): Take published learning outcomes about ethical reasoning and choose one or more that would be feasible in your course; Hack 2 (H2): Utilizing the learning outcomes of your specific course, determine if any can be revised to include “ethics” ideas, and whether the syllabus communicates value for/importance of ethical practice; Hack 3 (H3): Determine where in the course (syllabus) the learning outcomes created in H1–H2 fit best; and Hack 4 (H4): Design or revise assignments that will inform learners and instructors about whether the new/hacked learning outcomes (H1-H3) were achieved. The InC Hackathon of Educational Materials was scheduled over 1- and 2-hour blocks over three days totaling 8 hours during one week. Real-time feedback was collected in terms of clarity and feasibility of each Hack, and after the end of the Hackathon. Originally planned for 4-5 instructors working on one course, 14 instructors participated in some or all portions of the Hackathon, working on integrating ethical reasoning content into seven courses within three academic programs. All participants identified ethical content to integrate and worked to ensure that their courses would integrate different material and activities. Courses in sequence within an academic program were also hacked to introduce ethical content early, and develop more sophistication in later courses. Each program was able to develop achievable learning objectives for ethics content in each of the courses, and these were sequenced to support student growth throughout their program. After the Hackathon, participants deemed it feasible and clear, and all participants achieved the objectives of Hacks 1-3, but there was insufficient time to complete the work in Hack 4. More time was felt and demonstrated to be needed, as well as orientation by leadership at the start.  Additional time at the end of the Hackathon should be dedicated to curriculum-wide alignment of the results of the hacks. This InC pilot was an empirical demonstration of a coherent, reproducible framework for making systemic and systematic changes to higher education curricula.",

          "abstract": "Opportunity youth—individuals aged 16 to 24 who are disconnected from education and employment due to significant barriers—constitute a sizable yet underserved demographic whose marginalization leads to substantial social and economic costs. This paper demonstrates how data science can be harnessed for social good by mapping the distribution of opportunity youth across different regions. We develop an Opportunity Youth Index by integrating fragmented data from sources such as the American Community Survey, the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System, FBI Crime Data, and Bureau of Justice Statistics incarceration reports. Focusing on four key indicators—disconnected youth, youth in foster care, justice-impacted youth, and children with an incarcerated parent—we employ statistical methods and computational techniques to estimate local concentrations of opportunity youth. The resulting index provides insights for policymakers and community organizations, highlighting areas where targeted interventions can make the most impact. This work illustrates the potential of data science to address complex social issues and is presented in an accessible manner to engage a younger audience.",

This measure enables us to examine the relationship between labor market competition and firms' decisions to invest in general versus industry-specific skills. Our findings indicate that, as theory predicts, workers in more competitive labor markets receive less general training.",

          "abstract": "Passport inequality is more than a simple logistical inconvenience; it is a fundamental injustice that \nundermines the principles of equality and fairness upon which academia should be built. Scholars from the Global South often face daunting challenges when obtaining visas for research and conference travel.

These barriers not only impede individual academic endeavors but also perpetuate systemic inequalities within the global academic community. Drawing from our own personal experiences, we discuss mobility barriers, exposing their structural, institutional, and personal dimensions. We call for a reflexive approach in IR to counteract apathy and the illusory sense of equality in academic practices and offer policy solutions to promote a more inclusive and equitable academic community.",

          "authors": "INVEST Flagship; Sanni Välimäki",
          "abstract": "Over the past decades, attitudes toward mothers’ roles have become more gender-egalitarian. There has been a concurrent increase in early childhood education and care (ECEC) participation rates across Europe. However, inequality in ECEC usage has remained. The main reason for the inequality has been found to be problems with accessing the service but it is argued that attitudes toward mother’s role possible also play a role in it. This article examines the relationship between attitudes and ECEC usage at two points in time: 2008 and 2017. The article uses two data, EU-SILC and EVS, and the method multilevel logistic regression. The analysis considers both country-level and individual-level connections, reflecting on ECEC usage. The findings indicate an association between increasingly egalitarian attitudes and rising ECEC participation rates. As attitudes among less educated individuals change more slowly, their impact on ECEC usage could become more significant, particularly concerning inequality in ECEC usage. This is evident in the cross-level interaction between overall attitudes and mothers’ education in predicting ECEC participation among children under three years old. The disparity in ECEC usage between the less educated and those with higher levels of education is growing.",

          "authors": "MOBILE - Center of Excellence for Global Mobility Law; Amalie Ravn Weinrich",
          "abstract": "The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has established one of the most \ncomprehensive free movement regimes. By declaring West Africa a borderless region, the \norganisation affirms the right of free movement for all citizens of member states. Nevertheless, \nsignificant obstacles to securing this right persist, resulting in difficulties moving across the region. \nThese challenges are particularly prevalent for female migrants. Studies on free movement within \nWest Africa reveal that widespread corruption, border harassment, and bureaucratic inefficiencies \nseverely restrict female migration opportunities. However, current scholarship inadequately \naddresses the interrelation between regional mobility law, infrastructures, and female migration. This \narticle argues that a fundamental issue within the ECOWAS free movement regime is ensuring access \nto mobility infrastructures. It examines the gendered dimensions of access to mobility infrastructures \nfrom the perspective of ECOWAS officials. Mobility infrastructures are conceptualised as comprising \nlegal, physical, and technological components that collectively facilitate or restrict movement. The \nanalysis draws on documentary evidence and insights from 19 semi-structured interviews with \nECOWAS Commission officials. It shows that access to mobility infrastructures is predominantly \ndetermined by embedded gender norms, laws, and practices. By analysing accounts from officials \ninvolved in constructing the free movement regime, the article provides unique insights into the \ndisparities between institutional intentions, legal frameworks, and mobility trajectories. In doing so, \nit contributes to research on free movement in West Africa, mobility infrastructures, and the emerging scholarship on legal infrastructures.",

Through semi-structured interviews, this study explores the dynamics of the digital divide and the perceptions and experiences of undergraduate students in Bangladesh in ICT education and learning. The findings indicate that, despite the significant impact of the digital divide, caused by multifaceted socioeconomic inequality, ICT education has largely failed to provide students with essential digital skills. This article emphasizes the need for an effective learning environment that prioritizes three interconnected dimensions: equal access, resources, and digital literacy. By examining the interplay between digital divides and the imperative of integrating e-learning into pedagogical strategies, this study contributes to the field of educational policy and technology. Ultimately, this article advocates a digitally inclusive and student-centred digital learning environment in the technology-poor setting of higher education in Bangladesh.",

We also investigate the disciplinary, geographical and linguistic diversity, and the key bibliometric characteristics, of journals (co)published by different types of organisations. By augmenting WoS metadata with a custom classification concerning organisational information about the journals publishing and governing organisations available through the International ISSN Centre, this study provides a larger and more detailed analysis than has been available so far. Our results show that 66% of journals are published by a sole organisation type (professional, research organisation, society), and 34% respectively are published through combinations of these different organisation types. The most common form of collaboration was a professional publisher with a scholarly society as the collaborative organisation.",

          "abstract": "Our starting point is to challenge the often-made assumption that large cities are so complex that they have become ungovernable or that globalization pressures make political and policy choices irrelevant. By going beyond rational or positivist views of governance, it argues that the process of governing a city is never fully complete, nor linear. The paper refers to a systematic review of the academic literature. Urban societies are more or less governed and that may change from one city to the next, from one period to the next. Processes of government and governance are always work in progress, but make crucial differences over time. Case studies show that modes of governance have long-term consequences for their inhabitants and governing failures may have severe negative effects (e.g. housing shortages, low levels of educational attainment, crime, low productivity, health). The systematic analysis of the literature shows the need to describe and document at the same time (1) how processes of governance operate in relation to major urban development projects, the implementation of public policies and (2) the implications of such practices for inequalities; so to say articulating an analysis of the governance processes and their outcomes. The paper suggests that the link between metropolitan governance and inequalities allow considering inequalities not only as the outcomes of policy choices, but also as part of the way in which metropolitan policies are implemented.",

          "authors": "Sho Miyazaki",
          "abstract": "Do voters ``signal'' their decisions by voting early, or do they ``snipe'' by casting their votes at the last minute?  In transparent sequential roll call voting, such as in the U.S. House of Representatives, voters can strategically choose when to cast their votes. This contrasts with the U.S. Senate's sequential voting, where the order is exogenously determined, or private simultaneous voting, as typically seen in elections. Despite the significance of these roll call votes in high-stakes decision-making, the potential for strategic behavior based on vote timing remains underexplored. This paper examines the causal effect of transparent sequential voting on voter decision timing, leveraging a natural experiment from roll call votes in a crypto startup (DAO), which transitioned from private one-stage voting to transparent sequential voting. I collected a dataset of individual-level voting records, delegated voting power, and precise vote timing. First, the fixed-effect regression analysis reveals that introducing a public tally in transparent sequential voting increases the likelihood of early voting (signaling) or last-minute voting (sniping) compared to the baseline of private simultaneous voting. This finding is consistent with game-theoretic predictions. Additionally, interaction models show that more pivotal voters, measured by the Shapley-Shubik index, are more likely to vote early rather than snipe at the last minute. These results suggest that a public tally may adversely affect welfare regarding information aggregation, as signaling strategies can intensify the influence of pivotal voters.",

Study timepoints included pre-intervention, mid-intervention, post-intervention, and six months post-intervention. Cluster-adjusted regressions assessed change in IPV, social norms, and secondary outcomes for two intervention conditions (intervention participants; intervention community residents (community)) relative to adjacent control community residents. Intervention and community women's reported IPV decreased 26.8% and 20.5% respectively six-months post-intervention, with significant improvements in descriptive norms, gender equitable attitudes, relationship quality, and communication (for both intervention groups) and injunctive norms, leadership, and anti-violence advocacy (for intervention participants). Intervention and community men’s norms did not improve relative to control; however, both intervention groups reported improved anti-violence advocacy. Intervention men also improved in communication and help-providing to survivors. Change, an intervention intentionally designed for diffusion, may be effective at reducing IPV, improving associated norms, and extending programming benefits beyond those intentionally targeted.",

This project finds no evidence of a realignment with the Mao era in the party communiques or government reports under Xi Jinping. Instead, the reports under Xi Jinping are found to be more similar to those under his immediate predecessors. However, this project documents a divergence in the style of the party communiques and government reports under Xi Jinping, with the former becoming more abstract and ideological, and the latter becoming more concrete and policy-oriented. One source of this divergence is the downplaying of the five-year plans in the party communiques and government reports, which used to be the one of the overlapping themes of both documents.",

          "abstract": "Patterns of volunteering have predominantly been explained by focusing on the supply side of volunteering, where differences in volunteering reflect differences in resources and motivations. In this article, we shift the focus to the demand side of volunteering, and argue that a proper account of differences in volunteering must include differences in demand for help. We develop the concept of demand networks, as the inverse of support networks, and argue that demand networks are important to explain voluntary social work and support. We define demand networks as the demand for support requested through ego’s personal network. We propose a model where the amount of demand for help in ego’s network influences the likelihood that ego helps. We then turn to explain what factors create differences in amount of demand in personal networks as well as how they mediate and moderate the effect of demand networks. We focus on factors at 1) a structural level concerning the socio-economic strata of the individual and the organization of the voluntary effort, distinguishing between informal- and formal civil society, and 2) at an institutional level focusing on altruistic values and gendered social roles that may differentiate expectations to care for others and respond to demands for help. We test the resulting associational hypotheses using a cross-sectional population survey inquiring about volunteering during COVID-19 in Denmark. The results support the main hypotheses, indicating the importance of the demand side to adequately explain volunteering.",

          "abstract": "Visuals are effective forms of political communication online. However, there is scant comparisons between Instagram and TikTok, the two largest visual social media platforms. Using 814,810 Instagram posts and 1,174,086 TikTok posts curated from the same keywords, we analyze divergences across the two platforms in the 2024 United States Presidential Election. Results reveal collaboration increases engagement on social network-based platforms (Instagram) and decreases engagement on algorithm-driven platforms (TikTok). We find TikTok decreases the exposure of right-leaning content, with possible downstream effects on engagement. Top content on Instagram is driven by established media accounts, whereas TikTok features more individual commentators.",

          "authors": "Kate Sollis; Paul Campbell; Nicholas Drake",
          "abstract": "Australia’s newly established wellbeing framework, ‘Measuring What Matters’ (MWM), seeks to measure social progress and influence policy by reporting on 50 wellbeing indicators within five “themes”.  In this paper, we assess whether the MWM framework adequately measures what people in Australia value for their wellbeing by examining both the process of the framework’s development and its content. Firstly, we consider whether the consultation process undertaken was adequate. Secondly, we examine whether the MWM indicators align with existing research on what people in Australia value for their wellbeing. We identified limitations across all four aspects of the consultation examined: its comprehensiveness, reach, transparency, and extent to which it genuinely incorporated community feedback into the framework. While the MWM framework was found to broadly align with existing research on what Australians value for their wellbeing, there were some notable divergences. We urge the Australian Government to undertake a comprehensive, wide-reaching, transparent, and genuine consultation across Australia. Furthermore, we recommend that the Australian Government develop new indicators in consultation with the public. Enhancing the MWM framework will help establish it as a cornerstone of government decision-making, and importantly, ensure that it does what it purports to do: measure what Australians value for their wellbeing.",

          "title": "Bad medicine: Why different systems of organized crime demand different solutions",
          "authors": "Christopher Blattman",
          "abstract": "International drug trafficking dominates the conversation on organized crime, but equally common and serious are urban systems of organized crime—criminal groups focused not on exports or transshipment, but on dominating local markets, neighborhoods, and politics. When policymakers do pay attention to this problem, they consistently make the same mistake—believing there are best practices. But systems of organized crime are not all alike. There is no one blueprint or general solution, and so following the latest fad is unlikely to deliver the desired result. Instead of trying to copy the quasi-mythological success of a Giuliani or Bukele, policymakers need to understand what kind of organized crime problem they have, what capabilities their city possesses, and what tools are appropriate to the circumstances. This paper looks in-depth at how organized crime is organized in three cities: Chicago, Medellín, and San Salvador. It also considers New York, Bogotá, and Port-au-Prince. I argue that the primary driver of their organization and incentives is their source of criminal revenues. A second major driver of behavior is the degree of criminal political organization, which broadly-speaking takes three forms: atomized individuals, fragmented groups, and competing confederations. These forms are not just the product of their revenues, but are also the result of decades of competition with the state and one another. What policy tools will work hinges on this diagnosis. I look at the evidence for a range of standard policies—from crackdowns to street outreach—and explain why we can expect them to have wildly different impacts depending on the context.",

          "authors": "Joshua Midha",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel transaction-function model for valuing emerging markets, integrating machine learning, agent-based modeling, and multi-method valuation techniques. Traditional valuation models often rely on aggregated economic indicators such as GDP growth and inflation, which lack the granularity needed to capture the transactional dynamics and unique risk factors inherent to emerging markets. In contrast, the proposed model treats each market as a multi-dimensional function of individual transactions, analyzing these interactions through a multi-method framework that includes Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), comparables, precedent transaction, and multiples analysis. By incorporating machine learning algorithms, the model iteratively improves predictive accuracy, dynamically adjusting to new data in volatile and data-sparse environments. Additionally, agent-based simulations provide insights into behavioral responses to policy changes, regulatory shifts, and other market-specific conditions, offering a behavioral layer often missing from traditional approaches. Validation of this model demonstrates a marked improvement in predictive accuracy and adaptability compared to conventional models. This transaction-function approach provides investors and policymakers with a granular, data-driven tool for assessing the true growth potential of emerging markets, paving the way for more informed, context-sensitive investment decisions.",

          "abstract": "In recent decades, intensified human activities—overfishing, marine pollution, and offshore energy \nexploitation—have drastically altered marine ecosystems, inducing complex environmental and social challenges. The latter disproportionately impacts developing nations and vulnerable communities. While the law of the sea was originally designed to ensure peace, security, and legal order for the ocean, its facilitation of industrialized ocean exploitation has inadvertently contributed to widening inequality gaps. \nThis paper leverages infrastructure studies to discuss the \"infrastructural work of law\" and explore how law’s distributional effects perpetuate injustices in ocean governance. By analyzing case studies such as marine resource conservation and shipping regulations, the study illustrates how thinking of law through an infrastructural lens reveals its agency and its potential for harm in the global ocean polity. This perspective advances an understanding of ocean justice that accounts for the complex and multi-scalar dynamics required to address the unequal burdens of the Anthropocene.",

          "abstract": "The video game market is forecasted to be valued at $321.6 billion by 2027. Today, younger generations increasingly prefer spending their leisurely time playing online video games. Beyond providing a leisurely – and often competitive – activity to the bulk of its user base, online video games provide cybercriminals with an environment that is free from the reigns of legal enforcement. More specifically, with the growing popularity and uptake of the microtransaction business model, money launderers are provided with novel channels to move their illicitly gained funds. A continuously expanding body of evidence underscores that money laundering is occurring through online video games. Foremost, cybercriminals are attracted to the anonymity and global reach offered by online video games with few to no controls currently in place to disrupt laundering processes. Furthermore, regulations are struggling to keep pace with the latest money laundering strategies employed by cybercriminals. This paper explores and discusses money laundering in the context of online video games. Core vulnerabilities enabling money laundering to occur through online video games are identified. Security controls to reduce the scale of laundering are proposed.",

          "authors": "Mateo Hoyos; José Alejandro Coronado; Guilherme Klein Martins",
          "abstract": "This paper presents novel empirical evidence on the impact of trade on structural transformation. Leveraging quasi-experimental tariff variation from Brazil's trade liberalization in the 1990s, we examine its effects on regional sectoral employment shares. Building on recent cross-regional macroeconomic literature, we approximate the aggregate effects of trade on structural change by extending the traditional shift-share analysis to include estimates of spatial spillover effects, beyond the commonly reported local or direct impacts. Our findings reveal that Brazilian regions directly exposed to larger tariff reductions experienced a significant decrease in manufacturing employment shares, an increase in the primary sector, and a decline in non-tradables. Spatial spillover effects—whether based on migration or gravity links—are positive for manufacturing and the primary sector but negative for non-tradables. While positive spillovers in manufacturing partially offset local deindustrialization, the net effects remain negative and economically significant. These effects persisted for at least twenty years post-liberalization and are independent of potential confounders, including alternative structural change hypotheses and other shocks to Brazil's economy during the study period. Our results are consistent with the theoretical literature on trade and structural transformation which emphasizes the significance of comparative advantage.",

          "authors": "Dianyi Yang",
          "abstract": "Since 2022, central bank losses have been prevalent in advanced economies due to previous quantitative easing and recent inflationary pressures. This paper focuses on the unique case of the United Kingdom, where the government promised in advance to cover any central bank losses arising from quantitative easing. This promise is known as the indemnity. A game-theoretical model is proposed to explain the causes and effects of such indemnity. The model's predictions about the indemnity's effect on central bank profitability are empirically examined. Using the novel Dynamic Multilevel Latent Factor Model (DM-LFM), the indemnity is found to have significantly boosted the Bank of England's profits in the deflationary environment after 2008, but exacerbated its losses under the recent inflationary pressure since 2022. The theoretical model suggests the pronounced effects are due to the Bank of England's high sensitivity to losses and the UK government's moderate fiscal liberalism. Therefore, the British experience should not be generalised. Nevertheless, the theoretical and empirical lessons can inform policy-makers about future institutional designs concerning the fiscal-monetary interactions and the public finance-price stability trade-off.",

          "abstract": "The traditional framework of fertility research conceptualizes childbirth from the mother's perspective. From her perspective, birth is an uncertain and potentially recurring event. In contrast, the Born once, die once (B1D1) framework conceptualizes birth as an event experienced by the child. From its perspective, birth is certain and, like death, occurs only once. As an advantage over the traditional approach, the child's perspective allows for the use of density, survival, and hazard functions to study fertility age patterns at the macro level using birth counts for all parities by maternal age. Here, we reformulate the B1D1 framework using fertility rate notation and extend the traditional fertility framework by analogous density, survival, and hazard functions. We compare this extended traditional framework with the B1D1 framework using data on Swedish cohorts born in the 19th and 20th centuries. Large historical differences between the density, survival, and hazard functions in the two frameworks have diminished for more recent cohorts, suggesting converging conclusions about fertility age patterns. The new density, survival, and hazard functions can shed new light on differences in fertility age patterns across populations and advance traditional fertility research, including by capturing fertility and mortality age patterns with common concepts and measures.",

Donors, including bilateral and multilateral agencies, respond variably; bilateral aid often decreases following anti-NGO laws, while multilateral aid remains stable. Private donors' responses depend on factors like social trust and NGO transparency. NGOs adapt by diversifying funding, forming affiliates, or shifting to community-based support. As the space for civil society continues to shrink, coordinated international efforts are essential to counteract these repressive trends and uphold civil society's role in democratic governance.",

          "abstract": "The predominance of catastrophic and dystopian visions about the future makes it difficult to envision and articulate pathways for sustainability transformations towards more positive futures. To address this challenge, the \"Seeds of a Good Anthropocene” (SoGA) project began over a decade ago, in 2014. The project seeks to identify and amplify existing, innovative, non-mainstream sustainability initiatives, which we call “seeds”, that have the potential to contribute to new development pathways and create positive futures. These “seeds” offer tangible examples of how positive change is already happening out of the mainstream, and imagining how they could grow provides a useful way of describing different plausible, desirable futures and articulating pathways to move towards those futures. This paper reviews the history of the SoGA project, its theoretical underpinnings, and its ongoing impact on futures thinking, scenario development, and sustainability science. Combining personal reflections of the project's founders with a bibliometric analysis of over 30 peer-reviewed papers connected to the SoGA project, the paper identifies key people, places, and ideas that have contributed to the project. It also highlights the project’s diverse activities, such as a mobile app to identify urban ‘seeds’ and assisting in the development of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Nature Futures Framework. The paper concludes by suggesting future research directions for the next decade of the SoGA project.",

          "abstract": "In the United States, no jurisdiction ensures the fundamental conditions producing health, including housing, even though the phenomenon of homelessness is intensifying. King County, Washington, twelfth largest U.S. county, hosts the third largest homeless population, many of whom reside in Seattle. Discouraging encampments and providing shelter beds has proven ineffective. We investigate how street survivors make encampment choices based on amenities proximity compared to those in shelters and rental units. We analyze rich spatial, administrative, and outreach worker data from Seattle’s Evergreen Treatment Services (REACH) on people living unsheltered (from 2016 to 2022). We discuss the implications of providing effective support for people living unhoused, and provide what is — to our knowledge — the most comprehensive and recent study of neighborhood access and proximity to amenities among the unsheltered population in Seattle, WA. We find that encampment locations more closely reflected the access of renting, housed populations across all amenities in the majority of neighborhoods., and that some amenities provide an opportunity for personal agency with regard to basic needs, particularly food-related amenities (with the exception of food banks), were closer to encampments than shelters. We conclude that housing options that feel like homes rather than institutions are critical to support the unhoused. In the interim, shelters should be more integrated into neighborhoods, and better reflect tent encampment and rental trends. Policymakers and practitioners must provide effective support that centers on autonomy, dignity, and harm reduction for those who survive outside.",

          "abstract": "This research employs the Alkire-Foster approach to measure multidimensional poverty between 2012 and 2020 in China, followed by examining the role of the three-pillar pension system in mitigating household multidimensional poverty. With the China Family Panel Studies data, our measurement uncovers the sustainable effects and mechanisms of household participation in the multi-pillar pension system on poverty mitigation. The results indicate that more participation in the pension system mitigates the probability of being trapped in multidimensional poverty. The findings reveal the significance of state social insurance, enterprise annuity, and individual commercial insurance. The mitigation effect of market-oriented pillars is achieved through more investment in and consumption for livelihood assets. Based upon the sustainable livelihoods framework, livelihood assets ameliorate household capabilities in human, natural, financial, and psychological capital against risks, shocks, and uncertainties. Our research contributes to the knowledge of how household participation in pension pillars sustainably mitigates multidimensional poverty through micro-level mechanisms and to the policy praxis of why a facilitating state is called for poverty mitigation from the perspective of new structural economics.",

          "abstract": "This report investigates the feasibility of developing a holistic indicator to assess and communicate the social sustainability and quality of life in Vancouver. Despite the availability of various specific metrics, there is a noted absence of a comprehensive framework that integrates these metrics to\nprovide a singular, actionable view of the city's progress towards its social\nsustainability goals.\nThe City of Vancouver currently employs 45 population-level indicators under its Healthy City Strategy, demonstrating the city's commitment to transparent and data-driven governance. However, these indicators, while effective individually, do not collectively provide a complete picture of the city's overall\nhealth across various dimensions such as public health, housing, education, and environmental sustainability.\nThe aim of this research was to identify a holistic indicator that encompasses multiple dimensions of social sustainability to simplify assessments and improve strategic planning. \nThrough a desktop review of 70 existing indicators and consultations with experts, two models were identified as particularly promising: the Greater London Authority's (GLA) Wellbeing and Sustainability Measure, and the City of Calgary's Equity Index (CEI). These models offer robust frameworks that prioritize equity, accessibility, and stakeholder involvement, aligning closely with Vancouver's urban development goals.\nThis work highlights the need for an overarching metric that reflects the interdependencies among various domains, ensuring that progress in one area does not undermine another. By leveraging insights from this research, Vancouver can enhance its policy implementation and community engagement, moving closer to achieving a balanced and sustainable urban environment. The proposed holistic indicator will also support the city in benchmarking against other urban centers and refining its\nstrategic initiatives based on quantifiable metrics.",
