          "authors": "Maxwell Semonian Vetter",
          "abstract": "The Hollywood Apocalypse Film and its tropes ultimately represent a genre interested in translating the horrors of colonial violence (mass murder, destruction and theft of land, forced internment) to an audience which both likely has not experienced said violence and potentially is not even aware of how it has directly benefitted their lives. This essay, however, examines the Indigenous Apocalypse Film, a rapidly developing countermovement to this genre, where members of indigenous and colonized communities create their own apocalyptic narratives reflective of their collective experience and history. The essay examines two prominent themes found in many of these films: the Apocalypse as allegory for indigenous trauma, and the reclamation of indigeneity as a tool of liberation.",

          "title": "How Journalists Can Foster Humble Inquiry in their Work and their Readers",
          "authors": "Musa al-Gharbi",
          "abstract": "On its face, journalism is a project that requires humble inquiry: reporters have to speak on matters that are fluid, complex, dynamic, and ambiguous – they have to turn in the “first draft of history” even as the “facts” continue to evolve. They must also convey “the facts” in a manner that is concise, compelling, and accessible to non-specialized audiences, often working under tight deadlines, and engaging with stakeholders who have their agendas, which may diverge from those of the readers, the publication, or the journalists themselves. Put simply, this is very difficult work. And “getting it right” often requires a willingness to check one’s assumptions, recognize and admit errors, and subordinate one’s vision and preferences to those of editors and audiences. This chapter will describe some failures and opportunities of news media to promote humble inquiry. It will discuss how journalists may foster HI in their own work and how journalists can encourage HI in their readers.",

          "authors": "Jesica Formoso; Nicolas Palopoli; Irene Vazano; Paz Míguez; Julián Buede; María Cristina Nanton; D.I. Burin; Laura Acion",
          "abstract": "Open Science (OS) has gained prominence as a framework for more transparent and equitable research, but few studies have directly examined the barriers faced by researchers in Latin America. Understanding these obstacles is crucial not only to systematize the challenges to OS implementation but also to design and evaluate targeted training initiatives that address them. In this study, we combined qualitative and quantitative approaches to examine the perspectives of Spanish-speaking researchers participating in an OS training program. Thematic analysis of open-ended responses allowed us to categorize perceived barriers into four domains: cultural resistance and perceived risks, knowledge and training gaps, structural limitations, and institutional constraints. Quantitative analyses using cumulative link mixed models revealed that participation in the training was associated with significant increases in knowledge and implementation of OS practices, along with higher ratings of their perceived importance. Together, these results show that training interventions can help mitigate some of the reported barriers, while also providing systematic evidence to guide policies and institutional reforms needed for sustainable OS adoption in the region.",

          "authors": "Kenjiro Shiraishi",
          "abstract": "This paper contributes to meta-research on how clinical claims should be made transparent, reproducible, and auditable under open-science practices. We present a transferable Evidence–Values–Accountability (EVA) framework and use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as a testbed to analyze how research evidence, patient values, and institutional accountability can be structurally linked without endorsing specific therapies. The framework operationalizes transparency through repository-ready artifacts—checklists, prompt-preservation templates, preregistration pathways, and workflow logs—that document reasoning, evidence weighting, consent/risk communication, and human oversight. We map EVA to reporting and oversight elements (e.g., data availability, AI-use disclosure, and referral criteria) to reduce ambiguity at the research–practice interface and to improve meta-evaluation of clinical narratives. CAM is analytically useful because heterogeneity, cultural framing, and evidence gaps make reproducibility and governance challenges salient; recent AI-amplified misinformation (e.g., a bromism case) further illustrates why provenance and disclosure matter. Although demonstrated on CAM, the framework is domain-agnostic and intended for broader health research. By foregrounding research transparency and accountability rather than therapeutic claims, this work advances meta-research on how clinical knowledge is generated, communicated, and audited within open science, and offers concrete tools that health systems and journals can adopt.",

The present work evaluates the rise, impact, and imbalances of such collaborations in psychology via an analysis of n = 3,031,475 articles published in the 21st century. Results indicate that big teams – ranging from 10 to 100+ authors – are relatively unusual (n = 49,919) but rapidly increasing in popularity. More notably, such collaborations generate unusually high impact, in terms of yearly mentions in scholarly articles (n = 39,803,510), the news (n = 1,018,639), social media (n = 5,971,965), and policy documents (n = 69,959). To date, five countries account for over half of first and non-first author positions – imbalances that are linked to broader economic conditions (GDP and GDP per capita). Summarily, results suggest that big team science is an emerging trend in psychology that is currently inequitably deployed to generate high-impact scientific insights.",

          "abstract": "We tested the impact of a mindfulness training intervention to improve introductory physics students’ experiences while answering physics questions. We expected the intervention to reduce physics threat and to increase students’ confidence while lowering anxiety and judgments of difficulty. We also tested whether domain-level physics threat mediated the effects of the intervention on task judgments and whether the effects differed by gender. To test these hypotheses one hundred and forty-nine undergraduates were randomly assigned to receive either a 5-day mindfulness training intervention or no training (control). Both groups answered physics questions before and directly after the intervention and rated their confidence, anxiety, and difficulty for each question. Mindfulness training led to a greater increase in confidence and a reduction in anxiety among women and non-binary students, but not for men. The intervention also led to a reduction in judgments of difficulty for all students. The association between mindfulness training and self-reported anxiety among women and non-binary students was mediated by reductions in physics threat (measured mid-week using experience sampling). However, physics threat did not mediate any of the other mindfulness training outcomes for confidence or difficulty. The results are discussed in relation to a model of challenge and threat and mindfulness applications.",

          "authors": "Mark John Brandt; Jerad Morey",
          "abstract": "Scholars and practitioners have identified methods for helping people empathize and express more positive feelings towards the people they disagree with. We tested if stacking a light touch video intervention on a more intensive intervention boosts the more intensive intervention. If successful, this would provide a template for improving existing interventions using the less intensive interventions often developed by academic researchers. We stacked a brief video intervention highlighting sympathetic personal narratives previously shown to decrease political animosity on a multi-hour event, led by MCC Respectful Conversations, that aims to increase empathy and understanding through guided conversations. The idea is that the video intervention would open people up to the lessons of the event. We tested this in a preregistered pre-test post-test experimental design (N = 209, Events k = 10). Although effects for liking and respect for people with different opinions were in the expected direction (b’s range [.02, .05] across inclusion criteria), they were not typically significantly different from zero (p’s range [.03, .26] across inclusion criteria). We also explored if the events improved people’s attitudes in a one-group pre-test post-test design and found evidence that the overall events may be effective. In summary, we were not able to significantly boost the effects of the intensive treatment with a light touch video treatment. Suggestions for future research are discussed.",

Applying multilevel models to harmonized longitudinal panel survey data from the U.S. and 13 European nations (N = 59,030, ages 45 to 65) revealed that middle-aged adults in nations with less investment in family benefits (as % of Gross Domestic Product) and more income inequality (assessed using the GINI coefficient) report higher levels of individual-level loneliness and exhibit steeper within-person increase in loneliness over time. Findings from our observational study document that nation-level policy factors pertaining to family benefits and income inequalities are associated with cross-national differences in midlife loneliness.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Neural specialization is a developmental phenomenon across multiple domains of language processing. The home literacy environment (HLE) is observed to relate to brain activation during language and reading tasks; however, whether HLE relates to phonological and semantic functional specialization and sensitivity remains unknown. \nMethod: Using an open-source dataset, the present study examined 33 5–6-year-olds and 76 7–8-year-olds. Data from fMRI sound and meaning judgment tasks were used to examine phonological and semantic functional specialization (contrasting tasks) and sensitivity (comparing conditions within a task). Then, voxel-wise regression analyses were used to test correlations between those brain indexes and HLE (i.e., family-to-child reading, child independent reading) measured using a parent survey. \nResults: We observed weak evidence of phonological specialization at 5 years old and weak evidence of semantic specialization at 7 years old associated with family-to-child reading. We also observed weak evidence of phonological sensitivity at 5 years old and strong evidence of semantic sensitivity at 7 years old associated with family-to-child reading. Across the cohorts, a progression from temporal to frontal brain regions was observed in those relations, in line with prior literature on language specialization and sensitivity across development. \nConclusions: Overall, our results suggest that HLE is linked to functional specialization and sensitivity, with a relation of family-to-child reading to processing the sound structure of language at 5 years old and meaning at 7 years old. This finding supports the Interactive Specialization theory, which emphasizes the role of environmental inputs in neural specialization.",

          "abstract": "HIV stigma remains a barrier to equitable health care, affecting patient well-being and service delivery. This study examined HIV stigma among 260 health care providers in Türkiye, comparing HIV care providers with other professionals. Measures included HIV knowledge and training, fear of infection, observed stigma, stigmatizing attitudes, intention to discriminate, and facility policies. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses validated the Turkish stigma scale, and chi-square tests compared stigma indicators between groups. Stigmatizing attitudes and fear of infection were prevalent across all participants. HIV care providers had higher knowledge and training but still exhibited discriminatory practices. Policies reinforcing stigma, such as testing without consent and differential treatment protocols, were commonly reported. Structural interventions, anti-discrimination policies, and targeted stigma-reduction training are needed to foster institutional change and ensure equitable care for people with HIV.",

          "authors": "Jason Geller; Pablo Gomez; Erin Michelle Buchanan; Dominique Makowski",
          "abstract": "Perceptual disfluency, induced by blurring or difficult-to-read typefaces, can sometimes enhance memory retention, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate this effect, we manipulated blurring levels (clear, low blur, high blur) during encoding and assessed recognition performance in a surprise memory test. In Experiments 1A and 1B, response latencies from a lexical decision task were analyzed using ex-Gaussian distribution modeling and drift diffusion modeling. Results showed that blurring differentially influenced parameters of the model, with high blur affecting both early and late-stage processes, while low blur primarily influenced early-stage processes. Recognition test results further revealed that high blur words were remembered better than both clear and low blurred words. Experiment 2 employed a semantic categorization task with word frequency manipulation to further examine the locus of the perceptual disfluency effect. Similar to Experiments 1A and 1B, high blur influenced both early and late-stage processes, while low blur primarily affected early-stage processes. Low-frequency words exhibited greater shifting and skewing in distributional parameters, yet only high-frequency, highly blurred words demonstrated an enhanced memory effect. These findings suggest that both early and late cognitive processes contribute to the mnemonic benefits associated with perceptual disfluency. Overall, this study demonstrates that distributional and computational analyses provide powerful tools for dissecting encoding mechanisms and their effects on memory, offering valuable insights into models of perceptual disfluency",

          "abstract": "Background: Ecological momentary interventions targeting transdiagnostic mechanisms are promising for prevention and early intervention, but evidence on their mechanisms of change is very limited.\nObjective: To explore indirect effects of EMIcompass, a transdiagnostic, compassion-focused ecological momentary intervention, on mental health outcomes (i.e., psychological distress, clinical symptoms, quality of life) via candidate mechanisms of change (i.e., stress reactivity, emotional reactivity, threat anticipation, resilience, and aberrant salience) in youth with early mental health problems. \nMethods: We conducted a secondary analysis of an exploratory, assessor-blind randomized controlled trial, in which youth aged 14–25 years with early mental health problems were randomly allocated to experimental (EMIcompass+treatment as usual [TAU]) or control condition (TAU). Data was collected before randomization, at post-intervention and at four-week follow-up. \nResults: N = 92 participants were recruited, of which n = 46 were allocated to the experimental condition. No signals of indirect effects of condition on any outcome through the five mechanisms (i.e., 95 % confidence intervals included zero) were found. The magnitude of association, however, indicated that the association between EMIcompass and psychological distress may be mediated via pathways through threat anticipation (β = -0.12, 95%CI = -0.30 – 0.03). Further, we observed associations between changes in candidate mechanisms and mental health outcomes.\nConclusions: Although no direct signals of mediation via candidate mechanisms were observed due to lack of power, condition-linked shifts in our candidate mechanisms were associated with mental-health outcomes. Larger mechanism-powered trials are now required to delineate causal pathways and refine scalable prevention and early intervention strategies.",

Here, we introduce a novel bibliometric approach---combining computational semantics, large language models, and clustering methods---to explore article clusters within behavioral reinforcement learning. Our analysis provides a comprehensive map of the field, highlighting broad lines of behavioral and neuroscientific research and documenting a wide array of interdisciplinary topics. We characterize research clusters by frequent research topics and methods, key journals, and publication timeline. Moreover, we examine the relationships between clusters and visualize the distribution of research topics and methods across the landscape.

          "abstract": "Democratic checks and balances are crucial accountability mechanisms that prevent the abuse of power and protect citizens. Thus, citizens committed to democratic principles should be vigilant of reforms changing the balance of power. Using a mixed-design survey experiment with Polish citizens, this article investigates whether citizens are more vigilant of reform proposals that alter democratic checks and balances than other reforms. It also tests the effects of party cues on the intentions assigned to reformers proposing to alter democratic rules. The results show that (1) the in-party supporters evaluated the intentions to reform checks and balances as benign, whereas the out-party supporters were more vigilant and saw them as malicious; (2) participants were less vigilant of an administrative reform and evaluated it as less ill-intended; (3) these effects held across supporters of different political parties – both incumbent and opposition.

          "abstract": "Reward and punishment learning are critical across multiple clinical populations. The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is frequently used to assess these constructs and multiple forms of psychopathology are associated with IGT performance. However, it is not clear whether alterations in IGT performance are general to psychopathology, or specific to different forms of psychopathology. Thus, we examined whether IGT performance was uniquely predicted by anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder. We tested a sample of adults (N=293) on the play-or-pass version of the IGT. We characterized behavior using a hierarchical Bayesian computational model, formalizing parameters underlying task behavior. With the model, we examined unique associations between IGT performance and lifetime diagnostic history of anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder. Anxiety, but not depression or substance use, was associated with higher punishment learning rates, posterior mean β = 0.15, 95% CI [0.01,0.28]. In addition, women showed lower punishment learning rates, posterior mean β = -0.17, 95% CI [-0.30,-0.03], and lower response bias, posterior mean β = -0.30, 95% CI [-0.56,-0.05]. The relation between punishment learning rates and history of anxiety was small; however, our findings were consistent with established findings in anxiety derived from self-report. In addition, only main effects of diagnostic status were examined; thus, future research should examine comorbidity between diagnoses on IGT performance. Overall, our findings are consistent with research showing that anxiety is associated with punishment avoidance. In addition, our behavioral findings with respect to gender are also consistent with previous research employing the IGT.",

          "abstract": "Despite urgent need for sustainable solutions, many individuals resist sustainability innovations such as plant-based diets or genetically modified organisms. This sustainability behavior gap stems partly from misaligned risk perceptions: individuals rely on heuristics that generate cognitive biases, whereas experts use statistical probabilities. Existing interventions often fail to produce lasting effects because they neglect underlying cognitive drivers of risk perception. We introduce rebiasing, a novel strategy that leverages cognitive biases to realign risk perceptions. Across seven studies (N = 2,213), we show that (1) opposing heuristics and biases can neutralize each other, reverting perceptions to baseline; (2) rebiasing can be tailored to individuals with either high or low risk perceptions to better align with expert views; and (3) adjusted perceptions influence downstream sustainability behaviors, though context-dependently. Our findings advance theory on bias interaction and offer actionable insights for marketers, policymakers, and advocates seeking to close the sustainability behavior gap.",

In Pilot II, home-digital vs pen/paper r = .69, lab-digital vs pen/paper r = .70, and home- vs lab-digital r = .79. Scores were generally higher on pen/paper than on the digital versions (modality effect), but the two digital settings were more consistent.\nVocabulary: Both tests were reliable and convergent with PPVT: DAIVT α = .90; r = .76; synonym α = .85; r = .66. The synonym test was shorter than the DAIVT (~4.5 vs. 7 min) and required no audio, favouring remote feasibility; DAIVT provided stronger convergence, likely reflecting the similar format to the PPVT.\nAbstract reasoning: OMSS showed acceptable preliminary indices versus MaRs-IB (α = .67; r = .56; ICC = .51; ~11 min). A ~20-item OMSS form appears efficient with limited expected loss in precision.\nSelf-reported math (MARQ): Internal consistency was strong (α &gt; .80 for MARQ-19/5/3). Higher MARQ scores (poorer self-reported arithmetic ability) were weakly to, at best, moderately correlated with TTR (timed arithmetic performance); the strongest being for MARQ-5 (r = −.33, p = .011).\nFor the remote, online version of the TTR standardized administration (clear on-screen instructions, short practice, consistent device) is crucial to limit modality-related variance. For vocabulary, both online tests are suitable; the synonym test is pragmatic for remote use, whereas DAIVT offers stronger convergence at greater time cost. OMSS is promising pending item refinement and shortening. MARQ–TTR associations were weaker than expected, suggesting differences in construct coverage (broad self-report vs. timed operations), translation and sample effects. Within MARQ, the MARQ5 subset appears most suitable in our context due to its brevity, high internal consistency, and the strongest, albeit modest, correlation with TTR.",

          "abstract": "Some differences between the grammar of heritage and monolingual speakers have been attributed to grammatical innovation, such that heritage behavior may reflect ongoing patterns of diachronic change. We examined this claim by comparing the acceptability of clitic doubling in three different speaker groups: monolingual and heritage speakers of European Spanish, and Rioplatense Spanish monolinguals. Accusative clitic doubling is grammaticalized in Rioplatense but not in European Spanish, consistent with Rioplatense Spanish being a more diachronically innovative variety. If heritage speakers mirror diachronic change, they may perform more similarly to Rioplatense than European monolinguals. The results of an acceptability judgement task showed that heritage speakers had robust knowledge of clitics but did not show evidence of progressive behavior with accusative clitic doubling. We propose that grammatical innovation may crucially depend on the demographic characteristics of heritage speakers, and on the grammatical properties of the phenomenon tested.",

          "abstract": "Social scientists often compare groups in terms of relations between latent variables (LV) (often called structural relations) using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). LVs are measured indirectly by questionnaires; thus, measurement invariance must be evaluated before comparisons can be made. To efficiently compare many groups, the recently proposed Mixture Multigroup SEM (MMG-SEM) clusters groups based on their structural relations while accounting for measurement (non-)invariance. However, the current MMG-SEM relies on maximum likelihood (ML) estimation, which assumes continuous indicators. This can introduce bias when dealing with ordinal data, especially for variables with fewer item categories. In this paper, we extend MMG-SEM to accommodate ordinal data relying on the stepwise Structural-After-Measurement estimation approach. In the first step, we implement a multigroup categorical confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CCFA) with diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) to estimate the measurement model (MM). The second step uses ML to perform the clustering and estimate cluster-specific structural relations. A simulation study compares the performance of this approach to that of ML-based MMG-SEM under various conditions. The results show a better recovery of MM parameters with DWLS, particularly with fewer response categories, whereas both approaches perform similarly regarding the recovery of the clusters and structural relations.",

          "abstract": "Background: Ecological momentary interventions targeting transdiagnostic mechanisms are promising for prevention and early intervention, but evidence on their mechanisms of change is very limited.\nObjective: To explore indirect effects of EMIcompass, a transdiagnostic, compassion-focused ecological momentary intervention, on mental health outcomes (i.e., psychological distress, clinical symptoms, quality of life) via candidate mechanisms of change (i.e., stress reactivity, emotional reactivity, threat anticipation, resilience, and aberrant salience) in youth with early mental health problems. \nMethods: We conducted a secondary analysis of an exploratory, assessor-blind randomized controlled trial, in which youth aged 14–25 years with early mental health problems were randomly allocated to experimental (EMIcompass+treatment as usual [TAU]) or control condition (TAU). Data was collected before randomization, at post-intervention and at four-week follow-up. \nResults: N = 92 participants were recruited, of which n = 46 were allocated to the experimental condition. No signals of indirect effects of condition on any outcome through the five mechanisms (i.e., 95 % confidence intervals included zero) were found. The magnitude of association, however, indicated that the association between EMIcompass and psychological distress may be mediated via pathways through threat anticipation (β = -0.12, 95%CI = -0.30 – 0.03). Further, we observed associations between changes in candidate mechanisms and mental health outcomes.\nConclusions: Although no direct signals of mediation via candidate mechanisms were observed due to lack of power, condition-linked shifts in our candidate mechanisms were associated with mental-health outcomes. Larger mechanism-powered trials are now required to delineate causal pathways and refine scalable prevention and early intervention strategies.",

          "abstract": "Movement control faces a problem of redundancy. In general, there are more degrees of freedom available to solve a task than the task requires. This ‘degrees of freedom’ problem has been reframed as a ‘motor abundance’ feature (Latash, 2012), where the redundancy enables crucial flexibility. The balance between flexibility and control has been proposed to depend on synergies, which are lower-dimensional organisations of movement dynamics into systems that solve the task at hand. There are now several movement analysis methods designed to search for the signatures of synergies (the uncontrolled manifold, Scholz &amp; Schöner, 1999; tolerance-noise-covariation, Cohen &amp; Sternad, 2009, and others) and a great deal of empirical evidence that synergies feature in movement control. However, while all of these analysis methods rely on notions of ‘task’ to constrain movement solutions, they do not come with a formal theory of what a task is or how tasks are perceived. This paper proposes the hypothesis that tasks should be formalised as task-dynamical affordances, and that perceiving these via specifying information is how they constrain synergy formation (effectivities). I lay out the hypothesis, and detail a research programme to investigate the hypothesis, with reference to existing work on throwing.",

Using a pilot study and two between-subjects experiments, this paper investigates how individuals evaluate products differently depending on the scale used, how they implicitly categorise ratings on a five-point scale into binary bins, and how they estimate five-point distributions from binary scales. Individuals perceive products as higher in quality when ratings are presented on a binary scale, assuming reviews have been assigned to positive or negative categories based on whether they are above or below the midpoint of a five-point scale. Individuals perceive products as being of equivalent quality across scales only when ratings of four and five are taken as positive, and the remainder as negative. However, when individuals are asked to generate a five-point ratings distribution from binary ratings, they do not account for this skewed perception of positivity unless the five-point scale is labelled so that the ‘neutral’ point of the scale is defined as four rather than three. These findings have theoretical implications for understanding how people implicitly categorise and bin ratings, as well as practical implications for industry and policymakers.",

          "authors": "Nassim Elimari; Gilles Lafargue",
          "abstract": "The behavioral immune system, a set of antipathogenic psychological adaptations driven by disgust, has been shown to shape social dynamics and influence outgroup prejudice. Traditional models of xenophobia have historically emphasized the role of fear, stress, and anxiety, potentially overlooking the role of disgust. To better capture the specificity of disgust-driven outgroup prejudice, we introduce the term xenodyskheria (from the old Greek xenos-(ξένος) = stranger and-dyskheria (δυσχέρεια) = disgust or repugnance). We explore the extent of xenodyskheria's influence on outgroup prejudice before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic-arguably one of the most salient pathogen threats of the century. We found that, prior to the pandemic, pathogen disgust had no effect on rejection of and callousness towards healthy looking strangers. However, at the onset of the pandemic, pathogen disgust became the main predictor of outgroup prejudice. In contrast, neither stress nor anxiety were associated with outgroup prejudice during or after the pandemic. Interestingly, we observed a paradoxical relationship between pathogen and moral disgust, as the latter can serve as a \"buffer\" tempering the exclusionary tendencies of the former, despite these two disgust domains being highly correlated. Additionally, our Post-COVID sample showed no reversion to pre-pandemic levels of xenodyskheria, suggesting that the psychological effects of COVID-19 crisis may have left a more enduring imprint on social dynamics than previously assumed. Results are discussed in the light of evolutionary theories. Future research avenues for a dual-process model of behavioral immunity and for pre-genocide dehumanization processes are proposed.",

          "abstract": "Treadmill Virtual Reality (VR) has a potential application in rehabilitation, but its adoption is hampered by commonly experienced cybersickness symptoms, and an incomplete understanding of the factors that influence relevant (learning) outcomes. Previous studies have suggested that with active locomotion (self-motion) cybersickness symptoms may be limited. Restriction of the field-of-view – e.g., via the use of video vignettes – may also reduce symptoms. Whether a VR intervention is effective may also depend on the subjective presence within the virtual environment as experienced by the user. It remains unclear, however, what the optimal conditions to prevent cybersickness and to induce high levels of presence are. In the current study we investigated the effect of self-motion (walking vs. standing) and field of view as manipulated by vignetting (on vs. off) on cybersickness, presence and memory. Thirty-two healthy adults walked two predetermined routes in two different virtual environments: During one trial participants walked on the treadmill, determining direction with a handlebar (walking condition; using a Virtuwalk-treadmill), and during the other trial (order counterbalanced between participants), participants used the handlebar while standing still to move around the virtual environment (standing condition). In a between-subjects design, half the participants experienced the virtual environments with a vignette that restricted the field-of-view, while vignetting was not applied for the other half of the participants. In contrast to expectations, cybersickness was not influenced by walking or vignetting. However, results showed a positive effect of self-motion on presence, with higher presence in the walking than no-walking condition. In addition, presence and motivation were positively correlated. Vignetting did not affect presence, but it reduced landmark memory, potentially by partially obstructing the field-of-view. The current study’s findings thus suggest that self-motion is positively associated with presence, and in turn higher presence is associated with higher motivation. Vignetting did not reduce cybersickness and may not be recommended when memory of the environment is of relevance.",

Cannabis and non-prescribed tranquillizers (such as benzodiazepines) were most commonly used. The main reasons cited by participants for using drugs in prison were to relieve stress, forget problems, and counteract boredom. In a multivariate analysis, perceived social support and availability of meaningful activities were negatively associated with recent drug use while incarcerated. Other factors related to the prison environment had no significant influence on drug use, providing a more nuanced perspective on extant qualitative literature.",

          "abstract": "Polyregulation refers to employing multiple strategies to regulate emotions within a single emotional episode. However, evidence on its affective outcomes remains inconclusive, likely due to reliance on strategy count as the operationalization of polyregulation and the overlook of context sensitivity. Across two independent ecological momentary assessment (EMA) studies from the United States (Study 1, N = 158, 12,217 observations) and China (Study 2, N = 144, 11,347 observations), we introduced the effective strategy ratio, the ratio of idiographically effective strategies to total strategies used, to evaluate the overall quality of polyregulation. We directly tested whether the joint contribution of context sensitivity and the overall quality predicted various indices of momentary psychological distress. Total number of strategies was associated with increased distress at lower levels of the effective strategy ratio, but with reduced distress at higher levels. Context sensitivity magnified the benefits of high effective strategy ratio but was less helpful when the ratio was low. The results were robust across culturally distinct samples and after controlling for lagged distress. These findings underscore the utility of the effective strategy ratio and highlight the synergistic benefits of flexibly aligning idiographic effective strategies with contextual demands. We emphasize the importance of moving beyond strategy count to focus on overall quality and prioritizing context-sensitive emotion regulation in future affective science research.",

Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) offers a scalable neuromodulatory approach, but its behavioral effects in subclinical ADHD are poorly understood.

Twenty adults with elevated inattention completed two single-blind, sham-controlled, and counterbalanced sessions. Stimulation was delivered at 25 Hz to the cymba concha (active) or at 1 Hz with identical montage and sensation (sham). Participants performed the Attention Network Task (ANT: alerting, orienting, executive control) and a 2-back working memory task. ANT reaction times were analyzed with generalized linear mixed models; 2-back accuracy with linear mixed models. Blinding was successful, and only mild transient side effects occurred. Results showed that active taVNS selectively reduced flanker interference, indicating enhanced attentional control, with no effects on alerting, orienting, or working memory. These findings demonstrate a domain-specific benefit of online taVNS in subclinical ADHD, selectively strengthening executive control rather than producing broad gains across attention and memory.",

While LQH components are typically investigated in reading, their role in resolving cognitive conflict remains unknown. This study applies the construct of lexical precision to the traditional naming Stroop task, a gold-standard to quantify cognitive conflict resolution specifically investigating its influence in dyslexia and stuttering. \nMethod: Stroop interference was measured in 84 neurotypical readers, 50 dyslexic adults and 30 adults who stutter (AWS). All participants completed a naming Stroop task, together with a suite of individual difference measures that were analysed using a Principal Component Analysis, which established measures of phonological precision and lexical precision. \nResults: The data showed that, on average, dyslexic adults and AWS showed significantly larger Stroop interference effects compared with neurotypical adults. Crucially, the magnitude of the Stroop interference was moderated by lexical precision. Dyslexic adults and AWS who scored higher on the lexical precision component showed Stroop interference levels similar to the neurotypical adults, while those with lower precision demonstrated a significantly larger Stroop interference. However, the level of Stroop interference did not differ between AWS and dyslexic adults. \nConclusions: The results indicate that an imprecise lexical representation underpins the difficulties in cognitive control mechanisms that are independent of the specific neurodivergent groups.",

          "abstract": "Mixed emotions are strongly linked to aesthetic emotions, which involve both positive and negative emotional experiences. Mixed emotions are aroused as complex emotional reactions to artworks. However, the mixed emotional experiences aroused by paintings have received scant attention in empirical science. This study seeks to quantify the intensity of mixed emotional experiences aroused by paintings and explore their relationships with the emotional and categorical characteristics of the paintings as well as with aesthetic emotion. In online surveys, 948 participants rated 356 paintings across seven emotional scales: three for basic positive emotions (amusement, happiness, and pleasure), three for basic negative emotions (sadness, fear, and disgust), and one for aesthetics (beauty). The strong co-occurrences of aesthetic and basic negative emotions, such as “sad beauty,” were demonstrated using data-driven principal component analysis (PCA) and theory-driven quantifications with minimum index (MI). The couplings of basic positive and negative emotions were also quantified using MI and their intensities were associated with the aesthetic emotion, albeit those couplings were relatively weak and not evident in the PCA. Furthermore, both qualitative and quantitative assessments of the paintings revealed that mixed emotional characteristics were distinctive between their negative emotional constituents. The contributions of mixed and negative emotions to aesthetic experiences have been discussed in philosophical aesthetics and art studies. This study provides empirical evidence and sheds new light on these philosophical questions.",

Supporting this possibility, we observed that (a) contact with Black people explained racial group differences in stereotyping and, crucially, (b) exposing participants to counterstereotypic (Black–rich and White–poor) exemplars decreased the degree of stereotyping across a number of procedural variations and to similar degrees across racial groups.

This cross-sectional study investigated age-related differences in SEB skills and their gender variations using a large sample (N=31,315, ages 10-70). There were four key findings. First, there were temporary and modest decreases in some skill domains during early adolescence, possibly reflecting “adolescent disruption.” Second, despite these temporary declines, mean levels of all SEB skill domains increased with age, with most skill domains (Self-Management, Social Engagement, Cooperation, and Emotional Resilience) improving markedly during adolescence and early adulthood. This is broadly consistent with “maturation” in the personality trait literature. Third, there was considerable heterogeneity in age-related patterns when assessing specific skill facets. Fourth, there were some gender differences: men and women varied in age-related differences for Cooperation and Innovation skills, and non-binary youth reported lower initial levels on most skills but showed greater positive change during adolescence and early adulthood. These patterns show both parallels and distinctions with developmental principles derived from the personality trait literature, such as adolescent disruption and adult maturation.

          "abstract": "This paper presents a perspective grounded in critical psychiatry and decolonial epistemologies, synthesising interdisciplinary scholarship and lived experience testimony to interrogate the diagnostic construct of borderline personality disorder (BPD) as a site of iatrogenic harm and epistemic violence. Clinical discourse commonly positions long-term therapeutic engagement as a risk factor for “dependence,” framing care recipients as the locus of complication. Rather than accepting this premise, we locate harm within systemic, relational and epistemic practices embedded in psychiatric culture. We argue that conditionality, pathologising interpretations of support needs and punitive framings of self-advocacy produce iatrogenic harm, whereas consistent and validating therapeutic relationships foster safety and autonomy. Using a decolonial theoretical lens, this work critiques the misogynistic origins of the “dependence myth” and traces how Western attachment theory has been universalised to pathologise kinship forms outside nuclear family models, particularly in Indigenous, Black, migrant and collectivist communities. We further highlight how sensory processing differences are neglected in BPD discourse despite their significant role in self-injury, suicidality and embodied distress, calling for an expanded framework beyond relational psychodynamic explanations. Diagnostic bias toward sexually and gender diverse people is examined as a continuation of psychiatry’s historic regulation of gender and sexuality through personality pathology paradigms. Ultimately, we contend that the BPD construct functions less as a neutral clinical category and more as a colonial, cisheteronormative, and neuronormative governance technology that produces pathology through stigma, epistemic control, and carceral logics. Reframing BPD as a diagnostic instrument of social regulation rather than a disorder located within individuals opens space for care grounded in relational justice, cultural flexibility, sensory attunement, human rights, and epistemic humility, rather than the castigating of Western social nonconformity and the enforcement of compliance with normative behavioural conditioning.",

          "abstract": "Partners of transgender and nonbinary (TGNB) individuals face a unique set of relationship experiences and challenges, one of which may be a renegotiation of their own sexual identity. The current study explored how sexual fluidity beliefs, relationship satisfaction, and LGBTQ+ community connectedness were associated with sexual satisfaction among partners of TGNB individuals (n = 175; 72% cisgender women) via an online survey. Results showed that a minority of participants (27%) shifted their sexual identity label in response to having a TGNB partner; when shifts did occur, they were most often to broader labels. Relationship satisfaction was the strongest predictor of sexual satisfaction, and individuals who reported higher LGBTQ+ community connectedness reported higher relationship/sexual satisfaction relative to before their partner’s TGNB identity disclosure. Relationship satisfaction fully mediated the effect of LGBTQ+ community connectedness on sexual satisfaction. However, sexual fluidity beliefs were not associated with sexual satisfaction. The findings point to the ways in which relationships including a TGNB partner show similar patterns to those identified in other types of relationships, as well as highlight the importance of LGBTQ+ community connectedness for well-being in partners of TGNB individuals.",

          "abstract": "While time flows uniformly, many factors influence memory for temporal information. The current study examined how cross-event interconnection and goal-directed, agentic engagement impacted the temporal structure of memory for a virtual escape room game played with friends. We found that after controlling for the actual temporal distance, causally-related events were remembered as closer in time than unrelated events. This effect grew stronger after a consolidation period, with causally-connected memories showing greater temporal integration than memories that shared contextual overlap. Notably, within these causally-related events, temporal memory was superior for events where game clues were found. Further, participants who made greater in-game contributions to puzzle-solving showed better temporal memory and increased temporal integration between the contextually-related events compared to participants who contributed less. Together, these findings highlight the role of causal connections in driving memory integration and that agentic task engagement modulates how real-world experiences are remembered.",

          "authors": "Henna Vartiainen; Erik C Nook",
          "abstract": "Cognitive reappraisal is an emotion regulation strategy that involves changing one’s interpretation of a situation to change its emotional impact. Cognitive reappraisal studies typically assess changes in valence ratings following reappraisal as the primary dependent variable, but scholars have recently documented that valence ratings can take two forms: affective valence (i.e., the positivity/negativity of one’s hedonic internal feelings) and semantic valence (i.e., the positivity/negativity of one’s cognitive evaluation of the stimulus). Because typical rating instructions do not distinguish between these forms of valence, it remains unknown how strongly cognitive reappraisal shifts either one. We address this gap through two preregistered studies. In Study 1, N=155 participants completed a classic cognitive reappraisal task in which they either responded naturally to or cognitively reappraised negative images. Critically, we manipulated whether participants rated either affective valence, semantic valence, or “default” valence (conventional instructions). Reappraisal significantly improved valence ratings in all conditions, but reappraisal most strongly influenced semantic valence and least strongly affective valence. Interestingly, default valence behaved most similarly to semantic valence, suggesting that existing reappraisal studies largely document changes in semantic evaluations, more than affective experiences. Study 2 (N=105) replicated these effects within-subjects. These results extend research on affective and semantic valence by demonstrating that they vary in their responsiveness to regulation. Additionally, they suggest that existing research likely overestimates the impact of reappraisal on felt emotional experiences, prompting new perspectives on past findings and more focused methods for assessing the hedonic impact of emotion regulation.",

          "abstract": "The e-QPASS (Quick Psychoaffective Symptoms Scan) is a comprehensive 105-item psychopathology assessment that captures three core emotional dimensions underlying mental illness: depression, anxiety, and anger. While clinically valuable, its 10-minute administration time creates barriers for high-throughput clinical and research settings. This study developed a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) version to preserve comprehensive symptom coverage while dramatically reducing respondent burden. We analyzed data from 625 participants (47.8% female, ages 15-79) who completed the full e-QPASS. Exploratory factor analysis identified dimensionality, and Item Response Theory (IRT) Graded Response Models were fitted to calibrate item parameters. CAT simulations determined optimal item administration sequences, with final versions limited to 12 items for general psychopathology and 8 items each for internalizing and externalizing dimensions. Concurrent validity was assessed by examining preservation of known gender differences in externalizing symptoms between full and CAT versions. Factor analysis revealed a robust two-factor structure: Dysregulated Externalizing and Internalizing. IRT models demonstrated acceptable fit (CFI=0.965, RMSEA=0.059). The CAT versions maintained high measurement precision (SE≤0.40) across clinically relevant trait levels while achieving a 10-fold reduction in items. Gender differences in externalizing symptoms were preserved with identical effect sizes across both full and CAT versions, confirming construct validity. The CAT e-QPASS successfully balances comprehensive psychopathology assessment with practical efficiency, offering substantial promise for clinical screening, treatment monitoring, and large-scale research applications where repeated assessments are essential.",

The challenge of AI alignment is thus an interdisciplinary one that involves not only a technical challenge for computer science but one with important ties to the psychology of moral values, decision-making, and trust. Early work identified a static set of universal values, without considering the key questions of to whom and to which values AI should be aligned. This perspective paper challenges the notion of universal alignment and instead argues for dynamic, context-specific alignability across different domains, tasks, and users. Specifically, we emphasize the need to go beyond traditional pluralism and rethink how AI alignment can be achieved through a qualitative and quantitative research process that involves identifying context-specific values, developing alignable AI algorithms using limited human feedback, and evaluating alignment through assessing both an AI’s values and actions, while considering how humans trust and delegate to the AI. We discuss several paths forward for our proposed framework, including the potential ethical and societal implications of context-specific alignability, and draw on examples ranging from chatbots to value-aligned decision-making in the medical triage domain.",

          "abstract": "Whether selective attention alters initial sensory processing or instead only operates at higher cortical stages (often referred to as early vs. late selection) is a foundational question in cognitive neuroscience. Investigating the influence of covert visual selective attention, Clark and Hillyard (1996) found that directed attention modulated the amplitude of several early components (P1 and N1) of the visual event-related potential (ERP) derived from the ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG). However, attended and non-attended visual stimuli did not produce statistically different amplitudes in the C1 or P2 components. Dipole source estimation of the neural locus of these ERPs indicated that the C1 originated in primary (striate) visual cortex (V1), while the later components primarily arose from extrastriate visuocortical areas. Together, these results led to the conclusion that sustained spatial attention enhances the sensory gain of early visual processing in V1 via feedback projections from the extrastriate visual cortex where the P1 and N1 are generated. Despite the influential nature of this original work in EEG and cognitive neuroscience more broadly, recent research has reignited the debate on which stage of the visual processing hierarchy is influenced by attention. As part of the #EEGManyLabs project (Pavlov et al., 2021), we will be revisiting this issue by conducting a multi-site, high-powered direct replication of Clark and Hillyard (1996).",

Developing a digital adaptation of BAM has the potential to increase its accessibility and fill a critical gap in existing digital ED interventions, which to date have not specifically targeted anti-fat bias or fatphobia. This study applies a human-centered design approach to inform the development of a digital version of BAM.\n\nMethods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 31 participants, including 17 college students with elevated ED psychopathology and 14 past BAM participants. College students with elevated ED psychopathology shared experiences with fatphobia and anti-fat bias, how they use mental health technology, and thoughts on digitizing BAM. Past BAM participants shared experiences with BAM, how they use mental health technology, and thoughts on digitizing BAM. Interviews were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis with a critical realist lens.\n\nResults: College students with elevated ED psychopathology described pervasive and harmful experiences of anti-fat bias and fatphobia, coupled with difficulties accessing action-oriented mental health support, underscoring a gap in care that a digital adaptation of BAM could address. Both groups expressed strong interest in a hybrid digital format that combines synchronous and asynchronous components for a balance of social connection and flexibility. \n\nDiscussion: Findings suggest that a digital adaptation of BAM could address unmet needs in ED prevention by providing accessible, action-oriented content focused on anti-fat bias and fatphobia. Incorporating synchronous social connection within a flexible, interactive framework may promote engagement and impact. A critical next step will involve designing and pilot testing this digital adaptation of BAM to evaluate its feasibility and effectiveness.",

          "abstract": "Accurately quantifying belief strength in heuristics-and-biases tasks is crucial yet methodologically challenging. In this paper, we introduce an automated method leveraging large language models (LLMs) to systematically measure and manipulate belief strength. We specifically tested this method in the widely used “lawyer-engineer” base-rate neglect task, in which stereotypical descriptions (e.g., someone enjoying mathematical puzzles) conflict with normative base-rate information (e.g., engineers represent a very small percentage of the sample). Using this approach, we created an open-access database containing over 100,000 unique items systematically varying in stereotype-driven belief strength. Validation studies demonstrate that our LLM-derived belief strength measure correlates strongly with human typicality ratings and robustly predicts human choices in a base-rate neglect task. Additionally, our method revealed substantial and previously unnoticed variability in stereotype-driven belief strength in popular base-rate items from existing research, underlining the need to control for this in future studies. We further highlight methodological improvements achievable by refining the LLM prompt, as well as ways to enhance cross-cultural validity. The database presented here serves as a powerful resource for researchers, facilitating rigorous, replicable, and theoretically precise experimental designs, as well as enabling advancements in cognitive and computational modeling of reasoning. To support its use, we provide the R package baserater, which allows researchers to access the database to apply or adapt the method to their own research.",

          "abstract": "Social connection is a fundamental animal need, and its maintenance primarily depends on the rewarding nature of positive social interactions. A central feature of several medical conditions, including neuropsychiatric disorders, is decreased interest in positive social interactions and a tendency toward social isolation, which can in turn worsen these conditions. \nNumerous studies using animal models have identified brain mechanisms underlying both unconditioned and conditioned (using conditioned place preference) social interactions, where the interaction is imposed by the experimenter. In contrast, much less is known about the brain mechanisms involved in volitional, rewarding social interactions that are initiated by the animals themselves. This is critical as social interactions between humans are often voluntary. Early studies showed that rats will perform a volitional operant response to gain access to social interaction with a peer. More recently, the operant social self-administration procedure has been used to investigate the brain mechanisms of rewarding social interaction in mice, rats, prairie voles, and hamsters.\nIn this review, we summarize behavioral and neurobiological studies that have used the operant social self-administration procedure. We then discuss how this model has been used to study the effect of volitional social interaction across neurodevelopmental disorders, addiction, stress, pain, and inflammation, including its role in drug self-administration and relapse in rats, the identification of heroin-addiction–vulnerable individuals, and to study how pain and social stress disrupt volitional social interaction.

The findings show how early difficulties with mathematics and misaligned expectations about psychology as a discipline undermine fragile confidence when encountering statistical concepts, often resulting in hypervigilance and self-doubt.

Two studies were conducted to analyze the influence of participants' feminist identification and the joke teller’s gender on the appreciation and interpretation of feminist humor (Study 1) and on the proclivity to engage in collective action (Study 2). In Study 1 (N = 307), we manipulated humor type (feminist vs. neutral) and gender of the joke teller (woman vs. man). We found that weaker feminist identifiers perceived more criticism of sexism when the feminist (vs. neutral) joke was told by a woman (vs. a man), but no significant differences emerged in appreciation responses (i.e., funniness and aversiveness). In Study 2 (N = 200), we extended these findings and found that weaker feminist identifiers reported greater proclivity to engage in collective action after exposure to feminist jokes told by a woman, not by a man. These findings contribute to the understanding of the ways through which feminist humor can raise awareness of sexism, enable the recruitment of activists, and promote mobilization for social change.",

          "abstract": "Repetitive threat-neutralization is a common behavior pattern across anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that contributes to functional impairment. However, laboratory studies of this behavioral phenomenon are scant. In the present study, we examined effects of anxiety-related disorders and anxiety sensitivity on repetitive threat-neutralization behavior. Adults recruited from the community (n=40) with and without anxiety-related disorders completed clinician-administered and self-reported anxiety assessments and the Tap-to-Safety Task. Task stimuli included a threat cue (CS+) paired with shock, safety cues (CS-) never paired with shock, and safe stimuli varying in similarity to the CS+. The task included choice trials, in which participants could repeatedly tap a button to reduce risk of shock, while also reducing accumulation of reward points. In an extinction phase, shocks were no longer administered. We conducted linear mixed-effects models to examine differences related to anxiety sensitivity and anxiety disorder diagnosis in repetitive threat-neutralization behavior across stimulus types. Participants with greater anxiety sensitivity showed more adaptive neutralization behavior to the true threat-cue as well as more unnecessary neutralization to the former threat-cue. Those with anxiety-related disorders showed more neutralization behavior to the former threat-cue. Anxiety sensitivity and anxiety-related disorder status were both associated with less-steep declines in neutralization behavior across trials of extinction, consistent with the hypothesis that neutralization behaviors would persist in safe situations for anxious individuals. These findings suggest that the TTS task captures anxiety-related individual differences in extinction of repetitive threat-neutralization behavior, and provides an adaptable tool for probing threat-related behaviors.",

We conducted a pre-registered systematic review and multilevel meta-analysis to quantify the burden of psychological distress in this population (PROSPERO: CRD42024596813). A total of 139 studies and four primary databases were identified (k = 212, N = 128,684) via Scopus and supplementary searches through 31 December 2024. Based on established diagnostic thresholds, pooled prevalence estimates indicated that 28.9% (95% confidence interval 25.3–32.7%) of ECRs met the criteria for at least one mental health syndrome or symptom. Specifically, 28.9% (25.4–32.5%) met criteria for depression, 29.1% (25.4–32.9%) for generalized anxiety disorder, 24.9% (20.6–29.4%) for an eating disorder, 21.4% (17.2–26.0%) for alcohol abuse, 18.2% (14.2–22.6%) engaged in nonsuicidal self-injury, and 17.5% (14.2–21.0%) reported suicidal ideation. Complementing prevalence estimates, analyses of normalized severity scores indicated that ECRs experienced mild degrees of depression, anxiety, and moderate degrees of stress. Severity estimates for eating disorders and suicidal ideation did not exceed clinical cut-offs. Moderator analyses indicated that the type of syndrome and the type of measurement scale explained the largest part of the variance in both the prevalence and the severity models. Most individual-level factors, such as gender, ethnicity, academic discipline, country, career stage, social support, and supervisor relationship, did not significantly moderate prevalence or severity estimates. Age showed a small, but significant association with lower prevalence (β = -0.01, CI -0.03 – -0.0009). Higher study quality and random or full sampling were also associated with lower severity and prevalence levels of psychological distress. These findings underscore both the need for structural reforms and for the implementation of evidence-based support services and interventions for ECRs.",

          "abstract": "Across species, cooperative decisions are often asymmetric: one individual risks their own resources before knowing whether others will reciprocate. Such uncertainty is central to the evolution of trust and reciprocal exchanges. Physiological synchrony is frequently assumed to support cooperation, yet it remains unclear both how synchrony arises and how it functions in these asymmetric social interactions. We tested whether mutual visibility shapes physiological synchrony, and whether synchrony in turn predicts cooperative behaviour in repeated trust-reciprocity exchanges. Skin conductance synchrony was stronger and more temporally aligned when individuals interacted face-to-face, yet facial expressivity did not account for this effect. Contrary to the dominant perspective, higher synchrony predicted reduced reciprocity, and only when partners could see each other. Exploratory analyses suggested that this negative link depended on arousal, indicating that the social function of synchrony is shaped by both mutual visibility and the affective state of the individual involved. These findings show that physiological synchrony is not a uniformly prosocial mechanism but a context-dependent phenomenon that can undermine cooperation under certain conditions, offering insight into the mechanisms and the function of synchrony in shaping cooperative exchanges.",

Yet, past research has primarily relied on correlational approaches to test this theory, without experimentally manipulating norm information across different settings, limiting insights into how cultural context shapes conformity to norm information. Our study tests the effects of three social norm interventions on the climate-related attitudes and behaviors of 16,070 participants in 42 countries. We find limited evidence that cultural tightness moderates the strength of conformity to social norm information in our study, suggesting a more nuanced relationship between the two.",

Data extraction remains one of the most time- and labor-consuming steps in evidence synthesis (ES), making LLMs a promising tool with improved efficiency and accuracy. Our study evaluates the performance of different LLMs and proposes a novel method, Divide, Conquer, then Recheck (DCR), to optimize for LLM-based data extraction in ES. Multiple LLM foundational models were compared through accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We find that GPT-4o demonstrates notably better performance across most variables compared to ChatPDF, Bing Chat, and GPT-4. The proposed DCR method powered by GPT4-o achieved higher accuracy in most structured data extraction and the few-shot prompting strategy further improved performance on complex information (e.g., correlation coefficient).

          "authors": "Konstantinos Vassilis Petrides",
          "abstract": "This white paper presents the derivation and validation of the TEIQue-DISC®, a novel DISC assessment instrument derived from the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue). Widely used in workplaces for behavioral profiling despite well-documented psychometric limitations, the DISC model categorizes individuals along four dimensions: Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, and Conscientiousness. By extracting DISC profiles from the scientifically grounded TEIQue framework, the white paper introduces a robust alternative to existing DISC tools. Using multiple large datasets (N ranging from 101 to 13790), we implemented data-intensive methods, including machine learning techniques to identify items meeting stringent criteria for circumplex structure, internal consistency, and normative measurement. Multidimensional scaling analyses of three independent samples confirmed excellent fit to the theoretical DISC model, with the four traits arranged at approximately 90° intervals. Baseline internal consistency estimates were satisfactory across traits and datasets. Wide-ranging testing of 28 prespecified hypotheses examined relationships with gender, established personality measures (16PF, TEIQue, and NEO), occupational roles, managerial levels, and industry sectors. All hypotheses were supported, exhibiting theoretically expected convergent and discriminant validity patterns. The TEIQue-DISC® offers several advantages over legacy DISC instruments: empirically proven circular arrangement, protection against response manipulation through semantic concealment, dual assessment efficiency simultaneously providing both trait emotional intelligence and DISC profiles, and identification of up to 20 distinct behavioral styles through a mathematically exhaustive classification system. While constrained by inherent limitations of the DISC model, the TEIQue-DISC® constitutes an advancement in personality diagnostics, bridging sophisticated psychological theory with practical applicability.",

          "abstract": "Cochlear implants (CIs) provide deaf individuals with access to auditory feedback from their own voice during production. This experiment investigated whether typical hearing participants can use CI simulated speech feedback for perceptual learning and sensorimotor control of speech. CI simulation was achieved via noise vocoding, a technique that degrades the spectral detail in a speech signal in a manner similar to a CI. 32 participants took part in the experiment. First, participants were tested on their recognition of noise vocoded sentences before and after a training task; either perception training, where participants listened to noise vocoded sentences while reading matching text; or production training, where participants read aloud sentences whilst hearing their own voice noise-vocoded in real-time. Both groups of participants then underwent a speech motor adaptation paradigm in which formants were perturbed in real-time noise vocoded speech auditory feedback. Both perception and production training tasks resulted in significant improvements in recognition of noise vocoded sentences, with no effect of training type. Speech motor adaptation however was not significant at the group level in response to the formant perturbations. This suggests that successful perceptual learning for degraded speech is not sufficient for successful sensorimotor learning with degraded auditory feedback.",

          "abstract": "Group-level averaging of psychophysiological data often obscures meaningful individual differences, masking response patterns that may explain variability in behavior and central nervous system activity. Identifying such patterns is particularly relevant in heart rate (HR) responses to threat, where subtle variations may reflect distinct coping mechanisms such as orienting or defense. Machine learning techniques that learn latent representations, particularly variational autoencoders (VAEs), offer powerful tools for revealing such hidden structures.\nThis methodological report introduces a simple VAE-based approach for characterizing HR responses to threat pictures in 165 participants. To validate the method, simulations first demonstrated that the model accurately separated noisy sine and cosine waveforms. The VAE was then applied to empirical HR responses, mapping them into a two-dimensional latent space for subsequent cluster analysis, which was compared to clustering based directly on raw HR waveforms.\nThe VAE revealed three distinct response profiles: (1) strong decelerators (fear bradycardia), (2) weak decelerators with late acceleration, and (3) immediate accelerators without a decelerative phase. In contrast, clustering raw HR waveforms identified only two groups. Clusters derived from the latent space were more coherent and exhibited greater within-group consistency. Finally, applying the pre-trained autoencoder to a small fear-conditioning dataset enabled characterization of distinct HR response patterns despite limited sample size. These findings show that even a basic autoencoder enhances the categorization of psychophysiological response patterns, offering a framework for linking individual autonomic variability to broader models of affective and defensive behavior.",

We move beyond such comparisons to examine how cognitive processes might shape this relationship. In a pre-registered longitudinal study, we applied computational modelling to repeated decision-making tasks to test whether preference for immediate rewards moderates the longitudinal relationship between social media use and mental health. Adolescents with a greater preference for immediate rewards exhibited larger declines in behavioural activation as social media use increased. This effect was consistent across timepoints, indicating heightened vulnerability among those favouring immediate gratification. No moderation was observed for other mental health outcomes, and delay discounting was unrelated to time spent on social media or compulsive internet use. Cognitive processes could therefore provide insights into individual differences in social media’s mental health effects, offering future mechanistic explanations and potential targets for intervention.",

The first two dimensions relate to whether episodic retrieval is driven by the hippocampus and the neocortex, critically allowing for independent and additive contributions from both regions. The third dimension relates to the episodic-specificity of retrieval. Memories can be located at any point in this state-space and move to any other location. The state-space captures the dynamic nature of episodic memory and broadens the search space of possible memory states and transformations across time.",

We ran a pre-registered study with UK adults (N = 150, Prolific) where participants rated the value to them of 41 different monthly incomes (£1–£8000; random order). Comparing the fit of different classes of function, the most frequent best fit was sigmoid (59% of respondents; quadratic 37%; linear 5%). Generalized Additive Models corroborated the S-shape: the mean first derivative rose at low incomes and fell at higher incomes, while the mean second derivative was positive at low incomes and negative thereafter, with the inflection around £1,600/month. Exact question wording did not appear to affect the shape. The midpoint of the S-shape increased with respondents’ own income and the typical income of people they know. Thus, in this population, directly elicited psychological utility functions for income appear to be S-shaped, consistent with earlier findings and the Desperation Threshold Model: marginal utility increases up to a basic-needs threshold and decreases beyond it. Because the inflection lies at an income level actually experience by millions of Britons, these findings have potentially important implications for understanding real-world behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Even in today’s high-choice media landscape, people are drawn to stories of crime and murder, best exemplified by the massive appeal of the true crime genre. Interestingly, while studies report negative effects of violent media on consumers, newer avenues in horror research suggest that frightening media may act as training grounds for coping with anxiety. We investigated both perspectives in a two-week daily diary study on positive and negative affect (anxiety, anger) and true crime consumption (data collected in 2024). Cross-lagged multilevel modelling (Bayesian estimation) was applied to data of n = 199 participants to examine if affect on day n predicted true crime consumption on the following day (n + 1) and vice versa. We found that today’s anxiety positively predicted violent true crime consumption of tomorrow, and in turn, violent true crime consumption of today positively predicted positive affect of tomorrow. These findings corroborate the idea that anxiety may motivate engagement with self-relevant negative media worlds like true crime for emotion regulation, which may yield affective benefits. Conversely, we did not find that true crime consumption increased anxiety or anger, which adds nuances to the idea of fear and aggression cultivation by crime portrayals in the media.",

Drawing on a positive psychology perspective, we aimed to investigate how parenting joy and perceived partner responsiveness covary during this time and how they are related to the longer-term development of parenthood regret. We collected 35 days of experience sampling data, complemented by baseline and follow-up measures, from 269 parents in the United Kingdom (13,249 total observations). Using dynamic structural equation modeling (DSEM), we examined the within-person dynamics between momentary parenting joy and momentary perceived partner responsiveness. At the between-person level, we explored how participants’ average levels of these momentary experiences predicted changes in parenthood regret from baseline to follow-up. DSEM revealed a unidirectional, positive prediction from perceived partner responsiveness to parenting joy at the within-person level. At the between-person level, person means of joy moderated parenthood regret from baseline to follow-up, after relevant sociodemographic variables were controlled for. These findings contribute to the emerging literature on parenthood regret by emphasizing the role of daily emotional experiences and partner dynamics in shaping parental identity. Practically speaking, even small everyday adjustments in family interactions may meaningfully dampen parenthood regret.",

We offer a more in-depth and rigorous analysis of such evidence, and argue for a more skeptical conclusion: What commonly gets presented as evidence for neural representations actually isn’t.

          "abstract": "Humans act together to achieve feats they could never achieve alone and communicate to ensure alignment of meaning and understanding across different individuals. Explaining the unique human joint action and communication abilities poses an enormous challenge because it requires a systematic account of how people go beyond their own individual perceptions, thoughts, and needs to achieve joint outcomes and align their understanding. Here, we advance a new unified computational framework for explaining joint action and communication. It builds upon influential predictive processing architectures, extending them from individual cognition to multiagent, interactive settings. We assume that joint action and communication involve using and updating agent-neutral models that enable co-agents to predict collective outcomes of interactions regardless of who achieved them. This contrasts with previous frameworks postulating that agent-specific models predict action outcomes for self and others. We discuss three key claims derived from our framework: 1) Co-agents use agent-neutral predictive frameworks during joint action; 2) Co-agents update agent-neutral models interactively by shaping others’ predictions through verbal and non-verbal communication; and 3) Agent-neutral models enable dynamic role allocation during joint action. We highlight how these three claims stem from our proposal, what evidence currently favors or disfavors them, and what novel experiments could be conducted to test them further. Our agent-neutral predictive processing framework will provide a new perspective for understanding the individual basis of human sociality, which closely links theories of joint action and communication to principles of computational neuroscience.",

          "abstract": "Effective instruction should not only enhance immediate performance but also prepare learners to succeed when learning independently in novel situations (new learning). This study examined which timing and frequency strategies of instruction most effectively foster new learning. We compared six strategies, inspired by theories of motivation (e.g., self-determination theory) and cognition (e.g., testing effect), with two control conditions (no-instruction and full-instruction). Across three experiments (total N = 1,522), participants performed a category learning task. They first received instruction through feature highlighting, whose timing and frequency varied across conditions. Subsequently, their performance was assessed in an independent session where they learned new categories without instruction. An adaptive strategy that tailored instruction to learner performance significantly outperformed the control conditions in initial experiments (Experiments 1 and 2). However, this effect was not observed in a comprehensive experiment (Experiment 3), suggesting that adaptivity itself may not have been the beneficial factor. Instead, an overall examination suggested that the beneficial effects were attributable to two underlying instructional patterns shared by the conditions that outperformed the control conditions: (1) providing instruction in successive sequences, and (2) interspersing tests without instruction by restricting the frequency of instruction. Instructional strategies with these two patterns yielded a significant advantage over the control conditions for independently discovering correct knowledge in novel situations, although they did not reliably improve generalization of that knowledge to other items. This integration of instructional patterns appears to foster new learning by balancing the useful information from instruction with the desirable difficulty of testing.",

Within this narrative, Wilhelm Wundt and William James are frequently presented as dual progenitors of the experimental method. A widespread presumption is that these methods radiated from the United States and Germany outwards to other regions. However, broader evidence, drawing from the medieval Arab world and from later instantiations of laboratory psychology in Japan, China, India, and Argentina, demonstrates that experimental methods in psychology were developed and adapted for a range of contexts and purposes in other world regions. In these regions, laboratory psychology methods were marshalled to successfully effect major social and structural reform. These works are almost entirely absent from the canon of scholars associated with the birth of experimental psychology, yet their impact, like that of James and Wundt, has endured for over a century. The paper analyzes how the prevailing narrative describing the genesis of experimental psychology has been an organizing factor in the field. Recognizing a broader genealogy recognizes the accomplishments of psychological pioneers around the world, articulates the range of impacts that experimental psychology can achieve, and expands the hypothesis space of experimental psychology.",

Powerful computational tools also enable new analyses of high-dimensional data, incorporating feature annotation of the stimuli and model-based evaluation of gaze. These advances in both data collection and analysis are providing new insights into individual differences in both health and disease. Here we discuss four key approaches to modeling eye movement data: saliency-based attention phenotyping, data-driven gaze pattern identification, supervised machine learning classification, and unsupervised clustering. We highlight their advantages in psychiatry research, as they inform better understanding of visual attention, provide more fine-grained characterization of individual differences, and make more powerful clinical predictions.

          "abstract": "Social identity profoundly shapes whom people choose as information sources, constraining exposure to diverse perspectives. While people are motivated to seek accurate information, they systematically avoid outgroup sources even when group membership is irrelevant to the task at hand.  Here we investigate whether artificial intelligence (AI) can circumvent these identity-driven biases in source selection. In Study 1, a nationally representative sample of American adults (n = 1,054) preferred AI over human sources when seeking information about political conflicts. In Study 2 (n = 284), an incentivized political fact-checking experiment revealed that participants preferred AI sources over outgroup (d = 0.470) and even ingroup (d = 0.230) partisan sources, despite recognizing they were of equal competence. In Study 3 (n = 277), using an identity-irrelevant shape categorization task, participants only preferred AI over outgroup sources (d = 0.191), with no difference between AI and ingroup sources. Computational modeling revealed that these preferences emerge through selectively accumulated evidence against partisan advisors during deliberation, rather than differences in priors. These findings suggest that AI's perceived neutrality enables it to bypass identity-based discrimination. These results highlight the potential of AI to reduce echo chambers and broaden epistemic exposure by serving as an identity-neutral conduit for information acquisition.",

          "abstract": "Early childhood (3- to 5-years of age) is a period marked by significant developmental changes in the brain. This development underlies age-related improvements in several domains – including language, memory, and socioemotional skills. However, assessing changes in brain structure and function during this period using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) poses several challenges. For example, difficulty remaining still, maintaining attention for long periods and non-compliance in performing behavioral responses in the scanner are particularly prevalent issues. Technological advances in neuroimaging techniques over the past decade have significantly improved success rates for pediatric neuroimaging studies. For example, shorter scan durations and real-time monitoring and correction of motion during scanning have proven especially valuable in acquiring reliable data. However, developmental researchers must still be creative in order to adequately prepare young participants for the scanning environment and, subsequently, ensure the data acquired can be used to address the questions of interest. The success of these sessions has become paramount with the onset of large, multi-site consortium studies such as the HEALthy Child and Brain Development study, which seek to track normative and atypical brain development across the first ten years of life. To this end, the current report provides a pediatric neuroimaging protocol to improve young children’s scanning experience and developmental neuroimaging data quality.",

          "abstract": "Emotion regulation strategies play a critical role in helping people manage stressors and maintain psychological well-being. Understanding the efficacy and boundary conditions of regulatory strategies—as they are implemented in response to stressors in daily life—is especially important for college-aged students, a population that has been experiencing chronically high levels of depression and anxiety in recent years. Here, we utilized ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to capture college students’ use of multiple emotion regulation strategies in response to idiosyncratic, real-world stressors, as well as the effects of strategy use on momentary stress levels and momentary affect. Following a preregistered analytic plan, we first combined two EMA samples from Rice University and Bard College (N=159) to examine effects of strategy use on momentary affect. We also investigated the influence of factors that could interact with strategy use, namely momentary fluctuations in mental exhaustion and people’s general propensity to experience distress in the first place. Some results were consistent with our preregistered, a priori hypotheses, with rumination negatively associated with momentary affect, but use of other strategies did not significantly predict changes in momentary affect. Contrary to our predictions, efficacy of reappraisal slightly increased at higher levels of mental exhaustion. Exploratory analyses revealed that the number of adaptive strategies positively predicted momentary affect and the number of maladaptive strategies negatively predicted momentary affect. Overall, this study contributes to the growing body of research on the variable effects of emotion regulation strategies in real-world contexts. Our findings also speak to the dynamic interplay between strategy type/tactic, situational factors, and individual characteristics to drive changes in momentary affect.",

          "abstract": "Memory distortions emerge from a complex interplay between prior knowledge and ongoing experience—dynamics which are not readily provoked in controlled laboratory experiments. Here we investigate naturally occurring memory distortions using the largest known dataset of narrative recall, comprising hundreds of spoken recollections. Using large language models (LLMs), we developed an automated pipeline to detect and classify spontaneous false memories. Across two validation experiments, we demonstrate that human-AI agreement matches inter-human reliability in detecting and cataloging memory distortions. We show that false memories reflect two distinct phenomena which are driven by separable semantic factors: similarity to prototypical narrative patterns drives factual errors (distortions of actual content), whereas contextual surprise drives confabulations (entirely fabricated details). Through this combination of large-scale naturalistic data and AI-powered automation tools, we reveal memory processes that controlled laboratory paradigms cannot easily capture and illuminate the complex dynamics of human (mis)remembering in real-world contexts.",

          "abstract": "Language provides a window onto how people conceptualize their subjective experiences, including emotions. Although rare, linguistic analyses that go beyond emotion words provide deep insights into emotional experience across cultures. In this study, we explored cultural models of emotions prevalent in the US and Belgium using verbal descriptions of recent emotional events collected from speakers of North American (US) English and Belgian Dutch in form of semi-structured interviews. We analyzed the interviews in three stages: 1) topic modeling to characterize content, 2) word counting to examine linguistic resources, and 3) inductive analysis to uncover broader themes. Our findings revealed notable cultural differences alongside some similarities. US English speakers used more first-person pronouns and emotion words, emphasized high-arousal emotions, and prioritized asserting personal achievements and openly expressing their feelings. In contrast, Belgian Dutch speakers’ descriptions reflected a more moderated approach to emotions, illustrating how social standards and broader worldviews gave meaning to the events, with use of fewer first-person pronouns and more language focused on relativization and comparison. Taken together, our observations are consistent with previous psychological research on US and Belgian culture. We evaluate our approach against other means of exploring the conceptualization of emotion across cultures.",

          "abstract": "Recently, researchers have proposed that the Belief in a Just World comprises two dimensions: Effort-based Belief in a Just World (EBJW), focusing on the relationship between effort and reward, and Valence-based Belief in a Just World (VBJW), centering on the association of good and bad behavior with consequences. This research aimed to develop and validate standardized measures of EBJW and VBJW in English. Following item generation and selection, an initial list was administered to a US sample (n = 311). Subsequently, a refined list was administered to a second US sample (n = 276). The final measures demonstrated excellent reliabilities and strong convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity. For instance, egocentric selfishness was negatively related to VBJW but not to EBJW, and VBJW explained variance in egocentric selfishness beyond what was accounted for by General Belief in a Just World. This underscores the potential of these concepts and measurements to elucidate mechanisms underlying various justice-related phenomena.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Emerging research suggests that caregiver oral reading prosody may be a key feature of shared reading that supports children’s storybook comprehension, with potential implications for broader language development. Building on this evidence, the present study investigated whether associations between caregiver oral reading prosody and children’s language at the preschool age extend beyond real-time listening comprehension to include broader language skills.  \nMethods: Forty-one caregivers read a children’s book to their child (ages: 4–5 years) as they normally would at home. The caregivers’ oral reading prosody (intonation, timing, and loudness features) was examined in relation to children’s receptive vocabulary and core language skills. Moderated mediation models then investigated possible impacts of caregiver reading skills and shared reading time on putative links between caregiver oral reading prosody and child language.\nResults: Caregiver intonation range positively related to child receptive vocabulary and caregiver inappropriate (i.e., ungrammatical) pausing negatively related to child core language skills. Mediation models revealed that caregiver reading skills indirectly related to child language skills through oral reading prosody. Importantly, the indirect effect linking caregiver reading skills to child receptive vocabulary via caregiver intonation range was moderated by shared reading time, with the strongest effects observed in dyads reporting less shared reading engagement. \nConclusions: Findings illuminate caregiver oral reading prosody as one factor linking caregiver reading skills to child language, with effects through caregiver intonation on child vocabulary most evident in families with limited shared reading engagement. Overall, this research has implications for early language intervention approaches, especially among families of caregivers with reading difficulties and for those with limited shared reading opportunities.",

          "abstract": "Sometimes people miss the “good old days” of their country. This national nostalgia can\nfuel populist movements worldwide, rallying supporters with promises of restored glory.\nSocio-psychological work has characterized national nostalgia as a coping mechanism for\ncollective self-discontinuity, but it remains theoretically unclear which aspect of collective\nidentity (e.g., national, political, or moral) is most central in shaping national nostalgia.\nWe propose the Moral Nostalgia Hypothesis (MNH), which posits that moral identity is\ncentral. MNH predicts trait sensitivity, meaning that people who prioritize moral values\nare dispositionally prone to national nostalgia, and threat sensitivity, meaning that\nperceived moral decline evokes nostalgia more strongly than economic decline as a\nsituational response. We test MNH across four studies in 20 societies (N = 4,924) using\nsurveys and two centuries of English and Chinese texts. Values tied to hierarchy and\ntradition emerged as the strongest dispositional predictors of national nostalgia, even after\ncontrolling for multiple individual- and societal-level variables, while perceived fairness\ndecline was the most powerful situational trigger. These findings identify moral identity\ncontent, rather than material welfare or generic group cues, as the key mechanism linking\ncollective self-discontinuity to national nostalgia, illuminating why nostalgic political\nrhetoric framed as moral restoration resonates so powerfully.",

Using validated instruments, we employed linear regression models to analyze trends and Cohen’s d to pinpoint critical transition points, with analyses stratified by gender and school type. Results revealed a non-linear trajectory, characterized by a significant decline in most attitude and identity constructs during the transition to secondary school (6th-7th grade), followed by a rebound in the 8th-grade cohort. This decline was more pronounced among girls, particularly in self-efficacy and Science Identity. While both school types showed a similar decrease in Science Identity, private schools exhibited a protective effect on students' self-efficacy and perceived utility of science.

          "abstract": "Youth differ in how strongly they respond to environmental influences, with some individuals demonstrating greater sensitivity to both adverse and supportive contexts. Environmental sensitivity (ES) has emerged as a unifying framework encompassing theories such as differential susceptibility, biological sensitivity to context, and vantage sensitivity. This scoping review examined sensitivity as a moderator of the relationship between environmental exposures and mental health outcomes in children and adolescents. The review aimed to (1) identify key markers used to approximate individual differences in sensitivity and (2) examine the methods used to measure these markers across studies. A total of 34 articles representing 37 studies were included. Markers of ES fell into five categories: phenotypic (e.g., temperament, sensitivity), genetic (e.g., 5HTTLPR, DRD4), physiological (e.g., cortisol, vagal tone), biological (e.g., prematurity), and neurobiological (e.g., amygdala activation). Phenotypic markers were most commonly studied, primarily assessed through parent- or youth-report questionnaires. Sensitivity was found to moderate the effects of various environments on mental health, with differential susceptibility emerging as the most consistently supported theoretical model. Assessment approaches varied widely in measurement tools, informants, and analytic methods depending on the marker used. Few studies used multi-informant or longitudinal methods. This review highlights the value of identifying sensitive youth who may be more responsive to both risk and protective factors and highlights the need for more methodologically rigorous research to guide personalized prevention and intervention efforts within an ES framework.",

Among the most prevalent causes for WM impairment affecting military personnel, TBI and mTBI have been the most pervasive and consistently on the rise worldwide. Hence, current research efforts have been made to investigate relevant brain areas, cortical and subcortical regions, and cognitive functions related to WM impairment in military personnel. The aim of this review is to identify brain areas, cortical and subcortical regions, and cognitive functions related to WM impairment in military personnel from a selection of recent studies in order to inform novel clinical applications, including cognitive rehabilitation methodologies, for the benefit of individuals suffering from WM impairment. Affected brain areas included the VLPFC, DLPFC, VMPFC, OFC, FP, hippocampus, dorsolateral and orbitofrontal striatal circuits, and caudate nucleus. Identified disruptions to cognitive functions included slower reaction times, lower WM performance and accuracy in delayed visual and verbal abilities, and worse neuropsychological performance. Future research should focus on the cross-examination of underexplored WM impairment causes and affected brain areas and cognitive functions.\n\nKeywords: military personnel, working memory, impairment, traumatic brain injury, cognitive impairment, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, striatal circuits",

          "authors": "Eniko Kubinyi",
          "abstract": "The number of dogs in Western countries has increased over the past 2 decades, whereas the number of children has remained stable or decreased. Many dog owners, including those with children, say that their pets are more important to them than any human. Presumably, the declining fertility rates contribute to the increasing value of dogs in the lives of people, and dogs fill an empty niche. The companion-dog cultural-runaway theory posits that the change in dog-keeping habits has both biological and cultural evolutionary roots. Human ancestors developed a cooperative breeding system 2 million years ago, with the community aiding in child-rearing. Because people currently do not perceive the level of social support and trust to which they are biologically adapted, they seek alternatives. One coping strategy may involve transferring genetically based prosocial attitudes, such as the tendency to engage in parental behavior, to dogs. Western culture supports this shift and portrays dog ownership positively. Moreover, the biological evolution of dogs, with the spread of short-headed, small-sized lapdogs, also contributes to them being viewed as “children.” Dogs may facilitate or hinder the restoration of human network complexity, but this area is currently largely unexplored.",

          "abstract": "When talking about the world in front of us, humans are remarkably efficient communicators. Our referential expressions help listeners efficiently find what we’re talking about by strategically adding color or material words as needed. But most conversations are about things that are not physically in front of us. In these cases, do we also use language to efficiently help a listener retrieve an item from memory? Across two experiments, we asked participants to describe images to help a listener recall each image. In Experiment 1 (total n = 600), participants spontaneously incorporated expectations about memorability, providing relatively more description for images that people expect to be less memorable. In Experiment 2 (n = 300), we replicated this pattern even when participants had no access to or knowledge of their listener’s prior experience. Interestingly, people’s descriptions were more aligned with subjective estimates of memorability, rather than objective, empirically-derived metrics. Together, this work provides new evidence that speakers spontaneously guide listeners’ mental processes to effectively facilitate their memory recall.",

          "abstract": "Class differences in aptitude testing are often attributed to working-class deficiencies in a host of basic cognitive skills. The present research challenges this deficit narrative in the context of logical reasoning. We argue that reasoning tests often privilege abstract styles of reasoning as a \"neutral\" benchmark and provide a poor match to social-cognitive competencies promoted in working-class contexts. We evaluate this hypothesis in archival data from an international study of mathematical aptitude (N = 158,216), a pre-registered nationally-representative experiment on logical deduction (N = 781), and an integrative data analysis (IDA) combining data from Study 2 with three supplemental studies (N = 2,269). In Study 1, reasoning items higher in social-relational content (i.e., mentions of people) yielded smaller class gaps among eighth-grade students from 46 countries. Study 2 and the IDA experimentally replicate and extend these findings, demonstrating that reframing an abstract reasoning task to recruit social-cognitive skills reduces class-based performance differences among adults. Study 2 and the IDA also highlight that these effects cannot be explained by the mere inclusion of real-world content (e.g., money, food), but are most robustly produced by content invoking social relations. Our results support a cultural-psychological account of reasoning performance, highlight working-class strengths in social reasoning, and point to inclusive approaches to testing as a way to attenuate social-class gaps in aptitude testing performance.",

          "abstract": "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) can be quantified using a myriad of mathematical indices, but the lack of systematic and empirical comparison between these indices complicates the evaluation and interpretation of HRV data. This study assessed the reliability, consistency, and generalizability of the structural relationships among 89 HRV indices using a consensus-clustering approach. We analyzed 635 short-term resting-state electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings from two samples of college students with differing psychological profiles. Results from a sample with elevated internalizing symptoms (N=233)—collected across two sessions, one week apart—were compared to evaluate the test-retest reliability of the HRV clusters. To further assess the stability and generalizability of these HRV clusters beyond individuals with elevated internalizing symptoms, these results were compared with a second sample not selected based on psychological symptoms (N=203). We identified 19 clusters of 70 HRV indices with cross-method, test-retest, and cross-sample robustness. Based on the robust empirical convergence and the relative popularity of some HRV indices in the extant literature, we recommend 13 HRV indices for short-term recordings of resting-state HRV (under 10 minutes): RMSSD, SDNN, RSA (Porges-Bohrer or Peak-to-Trough method), RSA (Gates method), SD1/SD2 or CSI, ApEn or SampEn, HF or LnHF, DFA α1, DFA α2, one of the MDFA α1 features, one of the MDFA α2 features, one of the heart rate asymmetry indices, and one of the heart rate fragmentation indices. This approach mitigates the biases that can arise from redundant or highly correlated indices, facilitates clearer interpretation, and enhances the validity of conclusions drawn from HRV analyses.",

          "abstract": "Computational models of auditory salience predict that acoustic change and divergence from prediction increase the salience of sound streams. Confirming these predictions, prior research has shown that acoustic change and unpredictable sound features are linked to increases in physiological arousal and disruption of concurrent task performance. However, it remains unclear whether linguistic features, such as phonemic and lexical/semantic surprisal, help drive attentional orienting, or whether instead attentional capture takes place prior to linguistic analysis. To address this question, we introduce a new technique for assessing attentional capture by naturalistic task-irrelevant speech. In this paradigm participants tap to a metronome while ignoring a spoken passage from an audiobook. Salient features of the task-irrelevant speech capture attention, increase arousal, and expand subjective time, leading to shifts in tap timing. We show that distortions of subjective time are driven not only by acoustic change but also by phonemic surprisal. Thus, attentional orienting to sound takes place after the initial stages of linguistic analysis.",

          "abstract": "Back in 1961, Donald Hebb established a classic paradigm for studying repetition learning: He asked participants to remember several memory sets for an immediate serial recall task and repeated one set multiple times throughout the experiment. Participants’ ability to recall the repeated set improved gradually with repetitions, thereby demonstrating repetition learning. Explaining this effect has concerned researchers for decades, as it provides key insights into how we form durable memory representations through repeated exposure. In this review, we revisit the dominant views on the mechanisms underlying repetition learning, thereby challenging two central assumptions: The assumption that repetition learning is gradual, and the assumption that it is implicit. We show how these views have emerged from flawed analytical approaches, summarize recent evidence strongly contradicting these claims, and present a re-analysis of previously published data to illustrate how correcting implausible analytical assumptions leads to different theoretical conclusions. We propose an updated theoretical framework of the cognitive mechanisms underlying repetition learning in which we integrate elements from previous models of the Hebb repetition effect with established models of episodic memory, thereby joining two branches of the memory literature.",

Nine graphical Gaussian models (GGMs) were conducted: for each disorder, across three time phases (assessment to start-of-treatment; start to mid-point of treatment; mid-point to end-of-treatment). Each GGM included 19 nodes, based on PHQ-9, GAD-7 and NHS TTad phobia scores, using residuals as indices of change for each node. \n\nNetworks of symptom change were largely similar. Estimated network matrix similarity ranged between r =.74 and r = .91 across disorders, with depression and GAD networks more similar to each other than to panic disorder. Networks varied over time within the same disorder, more so for panic disorder (r = .61-.63) than GAD (r = .86-.90) or depression (r = .87-.93). There were close links between changes in worry-related items and feeling nervous or anxious, and between depressed mood and anhedonia across all networks, as well as links between sleep disturbance, appetite, trouble relaxing and irritability.\n\nFindings suggest shared patterns of co-change across anxiety and depression. There is a potential indication that therapy may work by leveraging existing natural change mechanisms rather than by creating entirely new patterns of symptom interaction.

          "abstract": "This paper presents a perspective grounded in critical psychiatry and decolonial epistemologies, synthesising interdisciplinary scholarship and lived experience testimony to interrogate the diagnostic construct of borderline personality disorder (BPD) as a site of iatrogenic harm and epistemic violence. Clinical discourse commonly positions long-term therapeutic engagement as a risk factor for “dependence,” framing care recipients as the locus of complication. Rather than accepting this premise, we locate harm within systemic, relational and epistemic practices embedded in psychiatric culture. We argue that conditionality, pathologising interpretations of support needs and punitive framings of self-advocacy produce iatrogenic harm, whereas consistent and validating therapeutic relationships foster safety and autonomy. Using a decolonial theoretical lens, this work critiques the misogynistic origins of the “dependence myth” and traces how Western attachment theory has been universalised to pathologise kinship forms outside nuclear family models, particularly in Indigenous, Black, migrant and collectivist communities. We further highlight how sensory processing differences are neglected in BPD discourse despite their significant role in self-injury, suicidality and embodied distress, calling for an expanded framework beyond relational psychodynamic explanations. Diagnostic bias toward sexually and gender diverse people is examined as a continuation of psychiatry’s historic regulation of gender and sexuality through personality pathology paradigms. Ultimately, we contend that the BPD construct functions less as a neutral clinical category and more as a colonial, cisheteronormative, and neuronormative governance technology that produces pathology through stigma, epistemic control, and carceral logics. Reframing BPD as a diagnostic instrument of social regulation rather than a disorder located within individuals opens space for care grounded in relational justice, cultural flexibility, sensory attunement, human rights, and epistemic humility, rather than the castigating of Western social nonconformity and the enforcement of compliance with normative behavioural conditioning.",

Addressing this gap is critical for advancing personality-in-context models and identifying mechanisms underlying deficits in interpersonal functioning. A two-week Ecological Momentary Assessment was conducted with 136 participants (N = 3,991 social interactions), who reported on motivational states, partner perceptions, and interaction preferences. The combined model integrating traits, states, and perceptions best predicted interaction preferences. Higher approach-related traits, states, and perceptions predicted increased interaction preference, whereas avoidance-related traits, states, and perceptions predicted lower interaction preference. Exploratory analyses revealed that maladaptive interpersonal functioning amplified the negative effects of avoidance trait and state motives on social evaluations. Integrating trait and state perspectives offers valuable insights for understanding social functioning, particularly in individuals at risk for interpersonal difficulties.",

          "abstract": "Since their inception, deepfake videos (i.e., AI generated or modified videos that depict a person saying or doing something they never did) have been primarily used to create non-consensual sexual imagery of women. We argue that false beliefs about the harms of deepfake technology (e.g., the idea that fake videos are not harmful because they are fake) encourage the watching, creation and sharing of deepfake content. We report on the development and validation of a 6-item deepfake myths acceptance scale (DMAS) over 3 studies (n = 1080) which consist of an Exploratory Factor Analysis, a Confirmatory Factor Analysis and a second Confirmatory Factor Analysis, which focused specifically on high-perpetrating populations. The scale has strong psychometric properties (Cronbach's α = .87) and moderately correlates with self-reported past behaviours and future intentions to watch, share, and create deepfakes.  The scale takes approximately 2 minutes to complete and is a useful tool for researchers who seek to understand the individuals and communities that produce and share deepfakes. We also encourage researchers to utilise the deepfake myth acceptance measure to assess the effectiveness of interventions at changing the attitudes/beliefs that underpin deepfake abuse.",

          "abstract": "The assumptions of standard tests such as the t-test, ANOVA and ordinary least squares regression are frequently violated. This can impact the desired error rates in statistical hypothesis testing. Robust tests like the Mann–Whitney U test and robust linear regression do not rely on assumptions such as normality and equal variances. Using them can counteract non-replicated findings that are just due to data anomalies, such as extreme values and outliers, which occur differently across studies. Employing them from the outset bypasses the pitfalls of deciding on the usability of a standard test with data. In this opinion piece, I summarize the epistemic benefits of robust alternatives. Restricting to a robust test instead of conducting it in addition to the standard test avoids generating multiple results, thus counteracting fishing for the desired, which can occur subtly. From a practical standpoint, running a single test simplifies analysis, and many robust methods are readily available in R. However, it is important to understand what a robust method does and what it is actually robust against. I also address common defenses of standard tests, discuss why they remain widespread, and suggest how these arguments should be countered.",

          "abstract": "Background. Humans have cognitive abilities that enable them to decide about taking precautions, such as avoiding predators, detoxifying food, and possibly taking vaccinations. By hypothesis, these cognitive abilities include reasoning about and applying precaution rules, such as taking precautionary actions conditional upon being exposed to a hazard (i.e., perceived threat) and belief that the precautionary action protects against the hazard (i.e., coping appraisal). Whereas standard health psychology models typically treat the perceived threat and coping appraisal as two separate factors, the precaution rule entails that they should be treated in conjunction. In this study, we tested (i) whether people’s stated vaccination intentions are in line with reasoning according to the precaution rule, (ii) under which circumstances they reason according to the precaution rule, and (iii) how the perceived threat and coping appraisal are associated with individual differences in worldviews. Method. We used a cross-sectional survey (Study 1, N = 923–1,575) and a mixed-subject experiment (Study 2, N = 811) with respondents from the Netherlands. Results. While threat and coping appraisals were related to vaccination intentions, respondents did not reason according to the precaution rule, irrespective of the circumstances. The threat and coping appraisals were associated with participants’ worldviews and partially mediated the association between these worldviews and vaccination intentions. Conclusion. Vaccination intentions are related to appraisals about threat and coping, but people do not use these appraisals in the normative manner proposed by the precaution rule.",

          "abstract": "Elderly people and patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s Disease (PD) immensely rely on arithmetic skills to lead an independent life. Activities such as medication management, financial transactions or using public transport require intact abilities to manipulate numbers with different arithmetic operations. However, research on cognitive deficits in PD has been focussing on domain-general functions such as executive functions, attention or working memory so far – largely neglecting potential domain-specific aspects of numerical cognition (e.g., carry or problem size effect). These aspects should be addressed, as PD-immanent deterioration of domain-specific numerical areas and domain-general functions suggests mechanisms of both primary and secondary (mediated by other cognitive deficits) arithmetic deficits, respectively. The current study systematically investigated arithmetic performance and effects in PD patients differing in cognitive impairment for the first time, targeting domain-specific cognitive representations of arithmetic as well as the influence of domain-general factors. Besides healthy controls (HC), PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) and PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) were compared in arithmetic performance in the four basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). The deficits consisted of problems in two-digit addition and subtraction and PD-MCI, as well as delayed arithmetic fact retrieval for single-digit multiplication and division in PD-NC and PD-MCI. Deficits were not domain-specific, as arithmetic effects (problem size, carry, and borrow effects) did not differ between the groups. Discriminant analyses showed that performance in addition, multiplication and division tasks could differentiate between PD-NC and PD-MCI. The study results help us to understand the underlying mechanisms of arithmetic deficits faced by PD patients in daily life.",

          "abstract": "Generalization enables individuals to apply knowledge derived from past experiences in novel situations, yet it is unclear whether common experimental paradigms probe the same underlying ability in early to middle childhood. We assessed 84 children aged 4, 6, and 8 years on four paradigms, namely statistical learning, associative inference, transitive inference, and categorization, and examined age effects and cross-task concordance. Accuracy increased with age in every task, but inter-task correlations were weak, suggesting that each paradigm might tap a partly distinct facet of generalization. Focused analyses of the associative and transitive inference task showed that older children’s success increasingly relied on memory for directly learned pairs. In younger children, the weak memory–generalization link diverged by task: 4- and 6-year-olds often solved transitive inferences without accurate pair memory, whereas such increased memory-independent generalization was not evident in associative inference. Computational modeling supported this pattern, indicating that younger children used value-based reinforcement learning to solve transitive problems, whereas 8-year-olds employed a pair-memory strategy. Taken together, our findings show that generalization develops through multiple pathways, underscoring the need for multi-indicator and model-based approaches to capture its multiple facets.",

Genetic associations in the extended major histocompatibility complex (MHC) remain of unclear relevance to immunopathogenesis but warrant finer-resolution analysis. Integrating non-MHC risk variants with immunological data implicates especially adaptive immune cells in psychiatric pathogenesis. Epigenetic studies show that resting immune cells carry a ‘poised’ landscape encoding past exposures and predicting future responses, illuminating how genetic variability shapes illness risk from environmental “insults” such as stress and infection. While only some patients may have immune-driven symptoms, the tractability and accessibility of the immune system make it a compelling focus for stratification and therapeutics.",

          "authors": "Olga Poluektova; Simone Tonelli",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the role of ethnonationalist sentiment in shaping opposition to abortion in contemporary Europe. Far-right political movements increasingly deploy conspiracist narratives of “native population replacement” to evoke fears about demographic decline, cultural erosion, and the loss of traditional values. We argue that these fears manifest both outwardly, as prejudice toward perceived out-groups, and inwardly, as support for tightening social norms and opposition to practices such as abortion and voluntary childlessness, which are viewed as contributing to the in-group’s demographic and cultural decline. Accordingly, we expect out-group prejudice to be associated with opposition to these practices. To investigate these dynamics, we analyse data from the European Values Study, focusing on perceptions of abortion justifiability. We find that (1) prejudice toward people of other races, Muslims, and migrants is consistently linked to viewing abortion as less justifiable, even after controlling for ideological and socio-demographic factors; (2) these associations has grown stronger over time; and (3) are especially pronounced in countries with a larger share of foreign-born residents from ethnically distinct backgrounds. These findings suggest that abortion opposition in Europe is increasingly intertwined with ethnonationalist views.",

In the present Registered Report, the proposed study will investigate the direct impact of the perceived availability of the cash-out feature on various facets of gambling behavior in an online experiment. Hungarian residents with online gambling history will be informed that they will have the chance to gamble with real money on sports events. Following random allocation, half of the participants will be told that they will have the option to cash out their bets before the outcome of the sports event is known, while the other half will not. The study will compare the proportion of participants placing bets, bet sizes, and bet risks between the two groups. Furthermore, the study will explore the differential effects of the cash-out feature on specific high-risk subgroups. The findings are likely to have significant implications for the design of online betting platforms, contribute to regulatory frameworks, and inform the design of interventions aimed at minimizing gambling-related harm.",

          "abstract": "Purpose. Research on workplace violence has predominantly focused on individual, organizational, and situational risk factors associated with employee victimization. However, limited attention has been paid to the interactional processes that shape workplace violence events despite microsociological theories and evidence underscoring the critical role of face-to-face interactions in conflict situations. This paper proposes a microsociological approach to better understand how workplace encounters escalate into acts of victimization. Methodology. To exemplify the value of a microsociological approach, we analyze body-worn camera footage of a work situation that escalates into aggression between a ticket inspector and a bus passenger without a valid ticket. Using qualitative process analysis, we examine how interactional dynamics involving status and emotions shape the step-by-step progression of this high-risk encounter. Findings. We demonstrate how the imposition of a fine transforms the inspector-passenger interaction into a status negotiation, with passenger aggression emerging in response to the inspector’s exercise of authority. Moreover, the inspector’s emotion management plays a key role in preventing the situation from escalating further into mutual displays of anger and aggression. This case illustrates how a micro-interactional analysis of risky work situations can reveal the mechanisms of violence and inform situational prevention strategies. Implications. We provide methodological and theoretical guidance for incorporating microsociological analysis into workplace violence research. Originality. This study demonstrates how a microsociological approach, grounded in a novel video-observational method, yields unique insights into the interactional dynamics that causally shape incidents of workplace violence.",

          "abstract": "We present a non-invasive stimulation technique called Sonoception that utilizes synthetic auditory frequencies at 6Hz and 2Hz to modulate behavioral, physiological, and neural responses in healthy humans. In three studies, we investigated the effects of Sonoception on emotional processing and inhibitory control, cortical processing of cardiac signals, and brain activation patterns. In Study 1, participants completed a Go/No-go task with faces showing disgusted or neutral expressions to assess the influence of the auditory stimulation on inhibitory control in emotional contexts. The 6Hz stimulation decreased false alarms for neutral faces, whereas the 2Hz stimulation increased false alarms for disgusted faces. This suggested a facilitatory effect of the 6Hz frequency on inhibitory control and a disinhibitory effect of the 2Hz frequency that enhanced impulsive responses. In Study 2, we assessed the heartbeat-evoked potentials as an index of heart-brain interaction and observed increased amplitude following 6Hz stimulation, suggesting enhanced cortical processing of cardiac signals. In Study 3, passive listening fMRI showed that the 6Hz stimulation selectively activated the left insula compared to the 2Hz condition. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Sonoception exerts distinct effects on behavioral, physiological, and neural functions, supporting the hypothesis that auditory frequency-specific stimulation can modulate cognitive-emotional functions, brain-body interactions and insular activation patterns.",

Across thematic focus, moral foundations, personal values, and emotional tone, most differentiation arose between churches, with smaller effects between denominations, and minimal variation between counties. Churches differentiated their sermons across several dimensions, including the use of high-arousal positive emotions and traditional moral values. Denominations differed in their endorsement of liberal versus conservative values and ritual content. Our findings suggest that churches and denominations differentiate their messages to serve distinct niches in America’s religious marketplace, offering new insights into the cultural dynamics of religion.",

Using hierarchical Bayesian computational modelling of emotion self-reports, we found that greater affective reactivity to gains and losses within the task was associated with more severe symptoms of both anxiety and hypomania.

Phase 2 (N = 918; ~9,086 responses; U.S.-only) replicated all scenarios and added four extensions: (a) a human-to-human comparison condition for every action, (b) Likert ratings (1–7) of perceived kindness alongside preferences, (c) random assignment to one of four between-subject survey versions (Robot→Human Preference; Robot→Human Likert; Human→Human Preference; Human→Human Likert), and (d) gender demographics.

This pre-registered, cross-sectional study examined these relationships using a representative Australian sample (N = 5038). In support of our hypotheses, subjective attribution partly explained the relationship between Australian identity and climate policy support. Specifically, those higher in Australian identity were less likely to attribute bushfires to climate change, which reduced their climate policy support. These findings expand our understanding of how differences in the content of a country’s national identity can impact climate outcomes and suggest that public campaigns should consider how appeals to national identity may influence climate policy support.",

The mechanism builds on prior generalized proposals put forward by the original proponents and advocates of the social cognition theories that have been typically used to predict behavior and provide insight into the mechanisms involved. I begin with a broad overview of social cognition theories, often referred to as reasoned action or rationale decision theories, and their general assumptions, predictions, commonalities in constructs, and evidence base. Next, I propose, and formally state, the current mechanism in which trait and dispositional constructs relate to intentions and subsequent behavior indirectly through the mediation of the sets of belief-based social cognition constructs that are proximally antecedent to intentions and behavior. Building on original social cognition theory proposals, I emphasize the informational function of the traits and dispositions, and individuals’ alignment of beliefs such that they are trait-consistent, as explanations for the proposed mechanism. I also outline the nascent research in the field that offers preliminary evidence to support the mechanism, and highlight some caveats and avenues for future research. Finally, I propose a trait-informed attitude, cognition, and intention tenet (TACIT) as a candidate label for the mechanism.",

Results revealed a non-linear trajectory, characterized by a significant decline in most attitude and identity constructs during the transition to secondary school (6th-7th grade), followed by a rebound in the 8th-grade cohort. This decline was more pronounced among girls, particularly in self-efficacy and Science Identity.

          "title": "How Effortful is Boredom? Studying Self-Control Demands Through Pupillometry (Registered Report Stage 2)",
          "authors": "Vanessa Radtke; Wanja Wolff; Corinna Martarelli",
          "abstract": "Self-control is essential for managing actions, yet its exertion is perceived as effortful. Performing a task may require effort not only because of its inherent difficulty but also due to its potential for inducing boredom, as boredom has been shown to be self-control demanding itself. So far, the extent of self-control demands during boredom and its temporal dynamics remain elusive. We employed a multimethod approach to address this knowledge gap. Ninety-five participants took part in an easy and hard version of the Stroop task. During both tasks, they indicated several times their perceived task difficulty, boredom, boredom-related effort, difficulty-related effort, overall effort, and fatigue. We tested whether pupil size, as a physiological indicator of cognitive effort, was predicted more accurately by difficulty- and boredom-related effort together than by task-difficulty-related effort alone. The best model fit included boredom-, difficulty-related effort, and their interactions with task type (easy, hard Stroop). Tonic pupil size increased during the easy Stroop, while phasic pupil size decreased with greater boredom-related effort in both tasks. Greater difficulty-related effort was linked to increases in tonic and phasic pupil size in the easy, but not in the hard Stroop. Finally, boredom-related effort in the Stroop predicted performance in a subsequent flanker task. Our results provide preliminary support that enduring boredom may not only be perceived as effortful but also be reflected in psychophysiological changes. Moreover, it may influence subsequent behavior. This underscores the importance of considering boredom as a potential confound in self-control research and broader study designs.",

          "authors": "Emily C. Kemp; Meghan Dontha; Zeying Du; Herry Patel; William E. Pelham",
          "abstract": "Background. Callous-unemotional (CU) traits (i.e., “Limited Prosocial Emotions”) characterize a particularly severe group of antisocial youth. “Secondary” CU traits, as opposed to “primary,” are distinguished by co-occurring anxiety and are theorized to reflect an acquired phenotype that develops through an interaction between heightened emotional sensitivity and prolonged adversity exposure. The aim of this study was to test this pathway in a large, diverse sample spanning late childhood (age 9-10) to middle adolescence. Methods. Data were drawn from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, with youth (N = 11, 880; Mage = 10; 48% female) assessed annually over five timepoints. Retrospective and prospective analyses examined the effects of emotional sensitivity and different forms of adversity on the development of CU traits. Results. Retrospective analyses showed no main or interactive effects of emotional sensitivity and adversity during late childhood in predicting secondary CU traits by adolescence. Instead, a significant interaction (B = .21, SE = .06, p &lt; .001, RRR = 1.24) was found such that higher overall adversity and emotional sensitivity together increased risk for primary, not secondary, CU traits. Prospective analyses among emotionally sensitive (≥90th percentile) youth with no CU traits (n = 365, age ~10) similarly showed no forms of cumulative adversity predicted increases in or the onset of “elevated” CU traits after four years. Conclusions. Findings did not support a distinct adversity-linked pathway to secondary CU traits via emotional sensitivity. Instead, results were consistent with alternative models in which secondary CU traits reflect a comorbid profile marked by broader clinical severity or overlapping liabilities (e.g., negative affectivity, internalizing risk).",

          "abstract": "Clothing size labels have been shown to influence women's mood, self-esteem, and body satisfaction. This study examined the effects of different sizing nomenclatures—specifically color-based versus category-based labeling—on women's body satisfaction, weight concerns, feelings of fatness, and mood. Participants attended a lab-based session in which their body measurements were taken, and size feedback was provided according to their assigned labeling condition. State mood, feeling fat, weight concern, and body dissatisfaction were measured at three time points: before measurement, after measurement, and after receiving feedback. Contrary to expectations, the results showed no significant changes across time points, nor any interactions between labeling conditions and time. These findings challenge previous research linking clothing size feedback to women's body image and emotional well-being, suggesting that the format of size labeling may not meaningfully affect body image outcomes. While some participants expressed a desire to reform the current sizing system, many remained indifferent to the nomenclature used.\nFuture research should explore other aspects of clothing experiences, such as fit, garment type, and shopping context—to better capture the complex relationship between clothing and women's body image and mood.",

Using an extended Kuramoto framework with additional global coupling terms, we demonstrate through numerical simulations that weak electromagnetic interactions can enhance phase coherence (R = 0.61 ± 0.04) across neural populations. The model achieves stable synchronization with parameters λ = 0.9 and G = 0.015, suggesting that long-range field effects may complement local synaptic connectivity in enabling large-scale neural integration. These results provide a mathematically rigorous foundation for field theories of consciousness while remaining grounded in biophysical principles.

Participants completed the task either alone or in groups of five with different types of social information and resource speeds. Contrasting earlier work, participants in groups outperformed solitary individuals, but only when payoff information was available. High-resolution visual field data and movement trajectories revealed that payoff visibility prompted adaptive recalibration of visual information flow, thereby enabling flexible adaptation. Computational models of fine-grained movement decisions and agent-based simulations showed that payoff information let participants dynamically identify and selectively respond to reliable social cues, thus unlocking the group's collective potential.",

          "abstract": "This study examined how acceptance, rejection, and repetition of social feedback shape implicit physiological responses and subjective stress evaluations in a naturalistic, fictional setting. Thirty-nine student teachers performed dyadic “Yes, And” (acceptance) and “Yes, But” (rejection) theatre improvisation exercises while heart rate (HR), electrodermal activity (EDA), skin conductance responses (SCR), facial muscle activity (zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii), and electrocortical activity indexed by frontal alpha asymmetry (FAAS), as well as self-reported stress were recorded. Across all improvised dialogue exercises, transient HR deceleration indicated a robust orienting response, while rejection elicited anticipatory HR slowing before stimulus onset, suggesting threat-related preparation. Zygomaticus major activity was higher in acceptance than rejection. Zygomaticus major activity, pre-stimulus HR, and self-reported stress decreased with repeated exercise.  Together, the findings of this psychophysiological investigation of the “Yes, And” principle of theatre improvisation demonstrated that fictional social interactions evoke psychophysiological responses, and that repeated exposure of improvisation exercises can partially attenuate them. These findings contribute to improvisation pedagogy and experimental paradigms in social neuroscience, and may also be applied to therapeutic applications by mapping how social encounters modulate embodied responses and self-reported stress in a fictional, psychologically safe context.",

          "abstract": "Visual memory and visual imagery are closely intertwined cognitive functions, yet whether visual memory necessarily deteriorates when visual imagery is impaired remains unresolved. Aphantasia, the inability to voluntarily generate mental images, provides a compelling model to address this issue. However, previous reports of preserved or subtle deficits in aphantasia may have stemmed from tasks with low cognitive demands, coarse measures, and memory content lacking fine-grained demands, thereby limiting sensitivity to genuine impairments. Using high-load paradigms and continuous precision measures with mixture modelling, we tested colour memory, a domain requiring fine-grained representation, to examine whether these conditions would reveal pronounced impairments in aphantasia. Experiment 1 (20 aphantasic, 20 controls) tested colour memory for six sets of 20 objects (15 meaningful, 5 meaningless). Meaningless objects were included to further minimise verbal labelling. All object colours were sampled from the Hue–Saturation–Value (HSV) space, a perceptually uniform colour space. Recall was assessed using a continuous colour wheel, and performance was analysed with a computational mixture model that decomposed response errors into retrieval success (whether a colour was retrieved) and precision (how accurately it was remembered). Results revealed that aphantasic individuals showed markedly larger errors than controls, driven by reduced retrieval success rather than precision. Moreover, error magnitude and retrieval success correlated with several imagery dimensions (e.g., object imagery, spontaneous use of imagery), whereas retrieval precision was not. Experiment 2 (18 aphantasic, 20 controls) further tested whether deficits extend beyond colour using an analogous size-memory task with a slider. No group differences were observed in size error, retrieval success, or precision, and no correlations were observed between memory and several imagery-related aspects. Taken together, this study provides the first evidence that visual imagery is indispensable for retrieval success but not for precision when accessing visual memory traces for object colour, and that this indispensability may not extend to all object features.",

          "abstract": "We tested whether the acquisition of specific elements of knowledge in a climate crisis class related to real-world collective action. We studied undergraduate participants (N = 133) in a climate crisis class (intervention condition) and participants not enrolled in the class (control condition). All were required to answer questions about their knowledge at two time points (separated by nine weeks), while we measured real-world collective action in the intervention condition through the 9 weeks as well as several self-reported beliefs. First, as preregistered, we found that some knowledge items as well as self-reported collective efficacy increased significantly for the intervention compared to control participants. Second, in the intervention group itself, and contrary to our preregistration, there were no significant relationships between knowledge / belief elements and real-world collective action, even though many participants engaged in substantial action. These results raise questions about how analytic knowledge of the climate and ecological predicament is measured, and how it is taught. They also point to the need for research of this kind to also measure how non-analytic elements, such as group dynamics, drive collective action participation. Finally, the study pioneers new methods for measuring real-world collective action in a class setting that goes beyond typical studies of hypothetical intentions to act.",

          "abstract": "Background: Meditation-based interventions (MBIs) hold promise for enhancing health and well-being. However, substantial barriers impede engagement in traditional forms of these interventions. Innovations in mobile health offer an avenue for overcoming barriers associated with traditional MBIs. A particular mobile health innovation – Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMIs) – has the potential to enhance the accessibility, acceptability, and efficacy of MBIs. However, there is limited research on EMIs integrated into MBIs (i.e., meditation-based [MB]-EMIs). This conceptual paper aims to make a theoretical case for MB-EMIs to highlight their potential and to inform future studies on MB-EMIs. Methods: We discuss the historical context, conceptual foundations, motivation for adoption, and empirical evidence supporting the potential of EMIs. Additionally, we explore the conceptual intersections between EMIs and both traditional contemplative sources and contemporary secular MBIs. Furthermore, we describe empirical studies on MB-EMIs. Findings/Results: Studies have demonstrated diverse approaches to integrating EMIs into MBIs. These studies exhibit variability in key dimensions, including the MBI with which the EMI is integrated and the characteristics of the EMI itself. MB-EMIs have therapeutic potential, but there are many important scientific questions about them that have not yet been answered. Conclusions: Future studies should continue to examine the impact and safety of meditation-based EMIs, leverage innovations in passive data collection, explore user experiences, develop these interventions for and with marginalized populations, and emphasize informal meditation practice. As the field matures, systematic reviews or meta-analyses will be essential to map the full landscape of MB-EMIs.",

A final 69-item scale is supported assessing thirteen first-order well-being factors, and three second-order factors. These were: Emotions, Job satisfaction, Emotional exhaustion, Cognitive wellbeing forming the Individual factors of well-being; Organisational commitment, Relationship with colleagues, Relationship with supervisor, Social isolation, Autonomy, Competence and Career Development forming the Interaction between individual and the organisation; and Musculoskeletal and Fatigue forming Physical health. The scale showed face, content, convergent, and criterion-related validity and was internally reliable. Academics but also organisations, supervisors, and Human Resource professionals can use the EWW scale to monitor remote e-workers’ well-being at work and identify specific risk factors related to well-being, which can then allow deciding about the most relevant interventions.",

The goal of this study was to examine the extent to which each component, as well as their interaction, contributes to social dysfunction in a combined nonclinical and transdiagnostic psychiatric sample. A sample of young adults (n=144) spanning the social dysfunction spectrum completed measures that capture different forms of psychopathology relevant to social dysfunction, from which two dimensions – namely Social Negative Affect (SNA) and Social Disengagement (SD) – were extracted using Principal Components Analysis. Participants additionally completed a variety of clinician-rated and self-reported social functioning measures that were aggregated into one overall social functioning score. Hierarchical regression was used to examine the unique contribution of SNA and SD and their interaction on overall social functioning. SNA and SD explained unique variance (Δr2=46.3%), indicating that elevated SNA and SD levels predicted worse social functioning. The SNA-by-SD interaction was positive and explained significant additional amounts of variance (Δr2=2.9%), indicating a less-than-additive effect on social dysfunction. These effects remained significant after controlling for intellectual functioning. The findings suggest that examining social behaviors and affect simultaneously is important for understanding social functional outcomes in clinical populations.",

          "abstract": "Substance use and psychosis frequently co-occur and are complexly interrelated. Nevertheless, the legal system sometimes requires conclusions regarding the causal effects of substance use on a defendant’s psychosis (e.g., to determine insanity defense eligibility - including “settled” insanity from chronic substance use). Objectives: We sought to understand how courts and mental health professionals conceptualize and resolve settled insanity claims. Hypotheses: Mental health professionals’ approach to settled insanity cases will map well onto the relevant body of clinical psychological science. Method: We conducted a case law review (Study 1: N=51 settled insanity cases), coding history and outcomes, substances involved, viability from a clinical science perspective, and qualitative reasons for case outcomes. And we conducted an experiment to evaluate the perspectives of mental health experts on the legal intersection of substance use and mental illness across three types of cases (Study 2: N=310 U.S. licensed psychologists, 52% female, M_age=37.66, M_experience=18.71 years). Results: In Study 1, 29.41% of the settled insanity cases were potentially viable on clinical science grounds, whereas only a single legal case (1.96%) was actually successful. Qualitative analyses showed courts often use circular reasoning to disallow settled insanity based on the very characteristics that define it. Study 2 found mental health experts evaluate evidence of permanent mental illness similarly, regardless of whether a legal defense of insanity is general or settled in nature. And they largely opine defendants who are actively and voluntarily intoxicated at the time of the crime are not legally insane, consistent with the law. Conclusions: The legal doctrine of settled insanity does not map well onto clinical reality and unnecessarily complicates the intersection of intoxication and mental illness by prompting insoluble questions about the etiology of mental illness.",

Emerging evidence suggests that EDs are associated with structural brain abnormalities, yet it remains unclear whether these alterations are consequences of the illness or pre-existing vulnerability markers. This study is the first to examine white matter (WM) integrity in female offspring at familial high risk (FHR) for EDs compared to healthy controls (HC). \nMethods: Forty-two FHR girls and 46 HC girls underwent diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). WM integrity was assessed using fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), axial diffusivity (AD), and mean diffusivity (MD), with group comparisons adjusted for pubertal stage and psychiatric diagnoses. Voxel-wise analysis using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was also conducted. \nResults: Global FA and RD differed significantly in girls at FHR for EDs versus HC in unadjusted analyses, but differences did not persist following covariate adjustment. TBSS revealed a significant cluster of reduced FA in the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) in the FHR group (p &lt; .05, Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE)-corrected). Exploratory analyses stratified by maternal diagnosis showed similar FA reductions in girls of mothers with Anorexia Nervosa and Binge Eating Disorder, with overlapping involvement of the IFOF. \nConclusions: Our findings suggest that WM-alterations in fronto-parietal associative tracts may represent early neurobiological markers of EDs vulnerability. Further research in larger, longitudinal samples is needed to confirm these preliminary results and clarify their potential as trait markers.",

          "authors": "Johannes Jacobus Fahrenfort; Simon van Gaal; Timo Stein",
          "abstract": "Science requires objective measurements to be able to falsify predictions, whereas consciousness is thought to be intrinsically personal and subjective. Consequently, behavioral measures of consciousness are often designated as “objective” or “subjective”. Surprisingly however, the exact meaning of the terms objective and subjective is typically not clearly defined. Moreover, applying this label to a given behavioral measure is misleading, as the same measure can often be analyzed within a “subjective” or “objective” framework. Thus, the objective-subjective designation is not only relevant to the measure that is used, but to several other dimensions as well. In this chapter we provide a brief overview of dichotomies along which one might conceptualize the difference between objective and subjective approaches, such as the empirico-analytical method (manipulation vs trial-by-trial sorting), the mode of stimulus presentation (forced-choice vs nonforced-choice), the response type (Type 1 vs Type 2), and the adoption of a ground truth when computing the outcome measure (performance vs appearance). Although these dichotomies often overlap, the correspondence between them is typically only partial. Problems and pitfalls are discussed. Finally, advice is formulated to always explicitly outline how one’s stimulus presentation, task, response measure, and analysis approach score on these dichotomies, requiring further explicit justification when claiming to capture “consciousness” as a construct.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly integrated into daily life, not only as tools but also as social partners that people may turn to for interaction and support. This raises important questions about whether, how, and why individuals form attachment-like bonds with AI, and what psychological implications such attachments may carry. Across five studies involving 1259 participants from Singapore and the US, the current work developed and validated the AI Attachment Scale and investigated the dispositional and motivational factors that predict attachment to AI, as well as its emotional and social outcomes. The AI Attachment Scale displayed strong psychometrics properties, including a reliable three-factor structure comprising of emotional closeness, social substitution, and normative regard subscales, strong convergent validity and discriminant validity, and high test–retest reliability. Examination of correlates revealed that time spent on AI, particularly for socioemotional purposes, was a strong predictor of AI attachment. Individuals higher in social anxiety, loneliness, and anxious attachment were also more likely to turn to AI as a compensatory surrogate when human connections were lacking. These tendencies were further linked to dispositional needs that AI fulfils, including closure through predictability, relatedness through socioemotional presence, and competence through affirming feedback. At the same time, stronger AI attachment is associated with heightened positive affect and life satisfaction, suggesting that AI attachment may satisfy the psychological needs and provide meaningful emotional benefits. These findings provide the first validated measure of attachment to AI and offer a foundation for future research on its psychological and societal implications.",

          "abstract": "Children’s intergroup attitudes emerge early in development; yet, most research has focused on contexts where egalitarian values are formally promoted, while structural inequalities remain implicit. Less is known about how these attitudes develop in conflictual sociocultural settings marked by visible exclusion and power asymmetries. This study addresses this gap by examining intergroup preferences among preschool-aged children in two sociopolitically stratified yet understudied contexts: Lebanon and Romania. We investigated how children evaluate peers from their ingroup, a stigmatized outgroup (Syrians in Lebanon, Roma in Romania), and a valued outgroup (French). In both studies, children completed a physical distance task and a friendship choice task. \nIn Study 1 (N = 94, Mage = 4.13 years, SDage = 0.83 years; 42 girls), distinct photographs were used for each group. Children showed a strong preference for the valued outgroup and consistently rejected the stigmatized outgroup across both tasks. These results were observed even among the youngest participants. In Study 2 (N = 87, Mage = 4.98 years; SDage = 0.82 years; 45 girls), the same photographs were used, and only group labels were varied. When physical appearance was held constant, the preference for the valued outgroup disappeared. Children instead favored the ingroup and continued to reject the stigmatized outgroup, indicating that labeling alone was sufficient to elicit exclusion.\nThese findings underscore the robustness of early bias against stigmatized groups, the sensitivity of young children to symbolic group labels, and the powerful role of both visual and social cues. They support the Integrative Developmental-Contextual Theory and highlight the urgency of early, context-sensitive interventions.\nKeywords: Early intergroup attitudes, Conflictual settings, Preschoolers, Physical distance, Affiliation",

          "abstract": "Learning is most effective when individuals actively engage with new information, \nexperimenting and integrating experiences to build meaningful understanding. Since it is \nrecognized as an active rather than a passive process, several factors may influence how \neffectively individuals engage with new information. One such factor is the sense of agency, \nwhich refers to the subjective feeling of control over one’s actions and may be important for \nlearning, as it transforms experience from passive observation into active understanding. The \npresent study aims to investigate whether differences in the sense of agency will affect \nimplicit learning by using an artificial grammar learning task. Participants were assigned to \neither an active condition, where they had full control over responses, or a passive condition, \nwhere they had much limited control. Subsequently, they rated their perceived control. \nResults revealed that participants in the active condition reported a stronger sense of agency \nand achieved higher accuracy than those in the passive condition. Both groups improved over \nrepeated trials, but the active group consistently performed better than the passive group. \nOverall, our study demonstrated that a sense of agency plays an important role in shaping \nimplicit learning, thus suggesting that learning is more effective when individuals feel in \ncontrol of their actions.",

          "authors": "Lukas Schellenberg; Wiebke Bleidorn; Peter Haehner",
          "abstract": "Understanding when and why people become lonely is of theoretical and practical relevance. Personality traits and loneliness have been theorized to reciprocally influence each other over time. However, longitudinal research on personality-loneliness transactions remains scarce, yielded inconsistent findings, and shares methodological limitations. To advance understanding of the longitudinal transactions between loneliness and personality traits, the present study analyzed data from three nationally representative large-scale panel studies (N = 63,555). Meta-analytic aggregation of the findings across datasets showed that, at the within-person level, increases in extraversion (β = −0.04), conscientiousness (β = −0.02), and emotional stability (β = −0.03) predicted decreases in loneliness 4 years later. In turn, increases in loneliness predicted decreases in extraversion (β = −0.03), agreeableness (β = −0.02), conscientiousness (β = −0.02), and emotional stability (β = −0.02) 4 years later. Notably, effect sizes differed substantially across the individual datasets. Overall, the present findings highlight the dynamic relationship between loneliness and personality traits, indicating that traits not only shape but also adapt to changes in loneliness. Personality traits therefore represent an important factor in understanding, preventing, and reducing loneliness.",

          "abstract": "Background: Although search-based advertising has been used for suicide prevention, the ad message type that most effectively promotes access to support information among users searching for life issues related to suicide risk remains unclear.\nAims: This study examined the types of ad messages that promote access to support information for users searching for life issues.\nMethod: We displayed advertisements in Tokyo to users who searched for keywords related to six life issue areas (perinatal women, domestic violence, addiction, depression, sexual minorities, and child abuse). Four advertisement types were combined: two headlines (empathic vs. informational) and two descriptions (with vs. without expertise). The outcomes were ad click and conversion rates for the three landing-page actions (self-check for mental health, self-care, and consultation services).\nResults: Empathic headlines increased click and self-check rates, suggesting their effectiveness in promoting early-stage engagement. In contrast, informational headlines were effective in promoting access to consultation services. Expertise cues decreased access to self-care and consultation services, yet increased access to self-care with empathic headlines.\nLimitations: This study examined a limited set of ad elements, was conducted in Tokyo for a limited period, and used Japanese-language advertisements and webpages. Additionally, conversion outcomes may have been influenced by the structure of the multifunction landing page.\nConclusion: Empathic messages facilitate early-stage behaviors, whereas informational messages promote access to information about consultation services. These findings highlight the importance of tailoring ad messages to users’ stage of help-seeking and life issue areas in digital suicide prevention strategies.",

          "authors": "Hugo Alexander Fleming; Gloria Feng; Robb Rutledge; Jonathan Paul Roiser; Oliver Joe Robinson",
          "abstract": "Pavlovian biases are patterns of behaviour that involve approaching stimuli associated with reward and avoiding those associated with punishment (regardless of whether this is actually optimal behaviour). They are an ubiquitous feature of everyday decision-making, and are also believed to play an important role in the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Although Pavlovian biases have classically been described as fixed and automatic, some studies have indicated that their influence on behaviour can actually vary over time and with task demands. While these results hint that people may have some control over their Pavlovian biases, direct behavioural evidence for this control is still lacking. In a preregistered, double-blind, sham-controlled study (N = 800), we tested whether a week-long cognitive training intervention could reduce Pavlovian biases on the Orthogonalised Go/No-Go task, a well-established paradigm for isolating Pavlovian-instrumental conflict. Participants were trained on either high-conflict or no-conflict conditions of the task across five days. Using reinforcement learning models to dissociate components of decision-making, we found that high-conflict training led to a significant reduction in Pavlovian bias—particularly avoidance bias—at follow-up. This result is incompatible with the view that Pavlovian biases are fixed and automatic, and instead implies much greater flexibility in the way that they influence cognition than has previously been understood. The training was kept deliberately simple (i.e. one stimulus per condition, with the correct responses kept constant over sessions) so as to provide a minimal proof of concept of whether Pavlovian biases can be reduced through training, but as a result we did not observe transfer to other tasks or self-reported mood. Nonetheless, these findings demonstrate that targeted cognitive training can modulate Pavlovian biases, which may be beneficial both in everyday life and especially in the context of affective disorders like anxiety and depression.",

          "abstract": "Psychometric network models have become increasingly popular in psychology and the social sciences as tools to explore multivariate data. In these models, constructs are represented as networks of observed variables, and researchers often interpret the presence or absence of edges as evidence for or against conditional associations between variables. However, the statistical evidence supporting these edges is rarely evaluated. Here we show that a large proportion of reported network findings are based on weak or inconclusive evidence. We reanalyzed 293 networks from 126 published papers using a Bayesian approach that quantifies the evidence for each edge. Across studies, one-third of edges showed inconclusive evidence (1/3 &lt; BF_{10} &lt; 3), about half showed weak evidence (BF_{10} &gt; 3 or BF_{10} &lt; 1/3), and fewer than twenty percent were strongly supported (BF_{10} &gt; 10 or BF_{10} &lt; 1/10). Networks based on relatively large sample sizes yielded more robust results. \nOur study shows that networks are often supported by too little evidence from the data for results to be reported with confidence, not meaning that results are flawed but rather suggest caution in interpreting individual edges.",

          "abstract": "Classic psychedelics profoundly influence emotional states, eliciting intense acute emotional experiences followed by subtle, sustained changes in emotional reactivity lasting up to several weeks. While clinical studies with controlled participant screening, dosing, and settings provide evidence for these effects, the impact of psychedelics is highly context-dependent. Thus, it remains unclear whether naturalistic, less-controlled psychedelic use similarly modulates emotional reactivity. To address this, our preregistered, cross-sectional fMRI study compared experienced psychedelic users (≥10 lifetime experiences; N = 33) with a matched group of non-users (N = 34) on behavioral and neural responses to emotional facial expressions. Psychedelic users demonstrated faster and more accurate recognition of angry facial expressions, suggesting reduced interference from threat-related stimuli during task performance. Whole-brain fMRI analyses revealed diminished neural responses to anger in limbic and salience network regions, coupled with enhanced responses to happiness in parietal and sensorimotor areas, consistent with prior clinical findings. Additionally, users showed increased precuneus activation in response to fearful facial expressions. Region-of-interest analyses further indicated reduced differentiation of emotional categories in two default mode network regions—the frontal medial cortex and parahippocampal gyrus. In conclusion, our study provides a nuanced view of neurofunctional alterations in emotional processing associated with naturalistic psychedelic use, advancing our understanding of its potential long-term effects.",

          "abstract": "Anger is prevalent in chronic pain (CP), often co-occurring with heightened distress and disability. The complexity of the anger construct manifests in heterogeneity of how anger is experienced, expressed, and regulated. Nevertheless, most work does not consider the inter-relationships between multiple dimensions of anger, limiting understanding of how anger might differentially contribute to pain outcomes. Here, various anger metrics and latent profile analysis (LPA) were utilized to identify disparate anger profiles in people with CP. Whether these profiles associated cross-sectionally and longitudinally with pain outcomes was subsequently examined. Data was collected from 735 treatment-seeking adult patients with CP of varied etiologies, of which 242 also completed follow-up assessments about 5 months after baseline. Anger measures included state and trait anger, anger expression (anger-in, anger-out), anger control (control-in, control-out), and perceived injustice. Pain outcomes included pain- intensity, distribution, interference, and behavior, and physical function. LPA identified four distinct anger profiles characterized by the combination of varying levels (low, medium, high) of anger and of perceived injustice. These profiles significantly associated with pain outcomes at both baseline and follow-up, above and beyond anxiety and depression. Profiles with medium-to-high levels of both anger (state, trait, and expression) and perceived injustice predicted the worst pain outcomes, suggesting that injustice-based profiling should be prioritized for anger-related stratification of risk in CP. The mechanistic and prognostic value of these anger profiles suggests that early assessment could enhance long-term treatment planning and advance personalized pain care, further emphasizing the need for tailored, anger-focused, patient-specific interventions.",

Findings revealed varied levels of internalized stigma, with some participants feeling ashamed or uncomfortable, and others perceiving menstruation neutrally. Anticipated stigma, stemming from societal views linking menstruation to femininity, led to fears of misgendering and medical discrimination. Enacted stigma included negative reactions and limited access to menstrual products and suitable restroom infrastructure. Participants resisted intersectional stigma by reframing menstruation positively or neutrally, and urged for the promotion of inclusivity.

          "abstract": "In creative fields, individual talent is often considered paramount for fame and success. However, forming social bonds, particularly romantic relationships with influential individuals, may also play a crucial role in career advancement. In this study, we investigate the associations between an individual’s fame in one creative industry and their engagement in romantic relationships with partners working in similar occupations, industries or sectors (referred to as ‘occupational homogamy’), as well as with famous partners. The French music industry, known for its numerous high-profile creative couples, provides a compelling context for this exploration. We conducted a web-based analysis of biographical data from 253 prominent French-speaking singers born in the 20th century, examining three Internet-derived metrics of fame (i.e., total number of hits, Wikipedia page length in octets and total number of pageviews), the timing of their musical hits, and the formation of romantic relationships. Data were primarily sourced from Wikipedia, press articles, and the Infodisc database, which lists musical success records in France since 1900. We found that occupational homogamy was common, with nearly two-thirds of singers engaging in at least one such relationship, more often women than men. Homogamy was positively associated with fame metrics (Wikipedia views, article length, chart hits). Relationships with celebrity partners did not yield additional visibility beyond homogamous non-celebrity ties, underscoring occupational proximity as the main channel. Sequencing analyses showed that a significant proportion of singers formed homogamous ties before their first hit, though these only modestly predicted later fame. This study suggests that, beyond talent and passion, forming a creative collaborative couple may both promote and accompany a rise in the occupational hierarchy, particularly in this competitive industry.",

          "abstract": "Little research has investigated explanatory models and treatments for mental health in sub-Saharan Africa. As a result, diagnostic systems and interventions remain limited in their ability to identify and effectively treat psychological disorders across diverse cultural contexts in the region. Contrary to Western conceptions, mental health in sub-Saharan Africa is nested within pan-African cultural values and knowledge systems, which prioritize community, ancestral and family needs over individual ones. These systems offer important insights for uncovering yet-unknown aspects of mental health. Guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), we evaluated 133 studies on mental health in sub-Saharan Africa. We analyzed each study for emic (culture-specific understanding of symptoms), etic (importing systems to assess universal aspects) or combined (merging both universal and culture-specific elements) approaches; study design; research location, and author-characteristics (e.g., proportion of authors from the region). Imported (etic) methodologies predominated (69.4%), though the majority (56.7%) of first authors were affiliated with sub-Saharan African institutions. Studies were nearly evenly split between observational and interventional designs. Research was geographically concentrated in South African metropolitan areas, while Central Africa was notably underrepresented. Within South Africa, although overall studies emphasized universal aspects, emic approaches were more common when studies were led by regional first authors, compared to other sub-Saharan contexts. Despite this, the predominance of foreign funding and training in South Africa may still privilege etic approaches; shifting decision-making power to local researchers could tip the distribution of emic and etic studies. Mental health research in sub-Saharan Africa continues to rely heavily on importing outside diagnostic frameworks and interventions, which de-emphasize local African knowledge systems. At the same time, findings also present a more nuanced picture of the current state of mental health research in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting avenues for further research and underscoring the need for more blended emic-etic approaches, locally funded researchers, and a broader cultural representation outside of South Africa. A blended emic-etic approach, which balances universals and incorporates region-and language-specific cultural concepts, is discussed. This approach ensures relevant clinical care in sub-Saharan Africa and has the potential to advance knowledge in mental health, globally.",

          "authors": "Marios Adamou",
          "abstract": "The construct of “camouflaging” has rapidly migrated from autism research into discourse surrounding attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), where it is increasingly invoked to explain concealed symptomatology and delayed diagnosis. This paper critically examines the theoretical, neurocognitive, and construct validity foundations of this transposition. Drawing upon Bayesian frameworks of impression management originally proposed for autism, it evaluates the motivational assumptions, computational demands, and measurement practices underlying claims of “ADHD camouflaging.” Three core incompatibilities are identified. First, motivational incompatibilities arise because the presumed stigma-driven model of concealment fails to account for pre-diagnostic masking and the diffuse, often implicit nature of ADHD stigma. Second, neurocognitive incompatibilities emerge because the executive function deficits characteristic of ADHD—particularly in working memory, inhibitory control, planning, and self-monitoring—contradict the iterative computational processes posited by Bayesian models of social inference. Third, construct validity deficits persist because extant measurement instruments are adapted from autism research, lack ADHD-specific content, and fail to demonstrate discriminant or predictive validity. The paper further analyses how the construct’s institutional uptake exemplifies Derksen’s concept of “human engineering,” wherein moral alignment and testimonial justice secure acceptance ahead of empirical substantiation. It concludes by advocating rigorous ADHD-specific instrument development, longitudinal validation, and ethical clinical practice that recognises compensatory effort without reifying an under-specified construct.",

In response, a community-university partnership formed in pursuit of developing culturally tailored mental health programming. To inform program development, the partnership conducted community-engaged research to understand diverse stakeholders’ relevant concerns, beliefs, and preferences. Methods: In Study 1, community health workers (n=13; 92% Black; 100% women; 23–78 years old, Mage=52) participated in one-on-one semi-structured interviews. In Study 2, community members (n=54; 100% Black; 63% women, 31% men, 6% gender not reported; 18–91 years old) participated in focus groups. In both studies, transcripts were coded using descriptive, semantic, realist thematic analysis. Member checks were conducted with organizational leadership, study participants, and broader members of the community. Results: Across both studies, participants described cultural (e.g., stigma) and material (e.g., insurance) barriers to care; systematic (e.g., poverty) and interpersonal (e.g., lack of social support) mental health risks; willingness to discuss mental health (e.g., increasing over time); and preferences for mental health education and services (e.g., provider authenticity). Individual study results and convergences and divergences across studies are detailed. Conclusions: Results informed the development of a pilot mental health education program, “Witnessing for Mental Health.” The community health worker–delivered program addresses participant-identified cultural, tangible, and systemic barriers to mental health care and leverages increasing community openness and interest in discussing mental health.",

In Experiment 1, the interim learning tasks of overt retrieval and cue-only JOLs (based on the painting without the artist name) improved future inductive learning compared to restudy, whereas cue–target JOLs did not (painting and artist name shown). Cue-only JOLs also produced response-time patterns consistent with retrieval-based processing, and self-reported retrieval use predicted their forward benefit. Experiment 2 replicated the beneficial forward effect of cue-only JOLs over restudy with different materials and found that providing item-by-item feedback did not change the effect. Our results suggest that cue-only JOLs, but not cue–target JOLs, enhancing future inductive learning of natural visual categories, likely through metacognitively controlled, covert retrieval processes.",

          "abstract": "Joint music-making and conversation are two fundamental forms of human interaction. A growing number of hyperscanning studies have examined interpersonal neural synchrony (INS) in music and language separately, yet few have sought to connect findings across these domains or interpret them within a unified theoretical framework. Recent reviews have underscored the need for systematic approaches that move beyond isolated reports of brain regions or oscillatory patterns. This article answers that call by applying David Marr’s tripartite framework—computational, algorithmic, and implementational—to INS observed during dyadic interaction in musical and conversational contexts. The aim is to move from descriptive to mechanistic accounts of synchrony.\nThe article introduces INS as a domain-general mechanism supporting social coordination, situates it within the rise of hyperscanning in social neuroscience, and explains how Marr’s framework bridges music and language interaction. To minimize interpretive pitfalls, it discusses methodological caveats specific to hyperscanning and emphasizes the need to distinguish intra-individual from truly interaction-specific processes. The review then synthesizes evidence from musical interaction, including dynamic synchrony, task manipulations, and sensorimotor coupling, followed by findings from conversational studies. Overlapping neural networks are mapped across domains, and Marr’s framework is used to interpret these shared systems in terms of the problems they solve, the processes they instantiate, and their neural realizations summarized in a comparative table. The final section outlines future directions and testable hypotheses concerning role asymmetry, mutual adaptation, and dynamic reconfiguration.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive Bias Modification for Interpretation (CBM-I) is designed to alter interpretation biases (IBs) and may have potential for reducing stress reactivity in individuals with social anxiety. However, evidence for such transfer effects remains inconsistent and largely restricted to specific cognitive or self-report outcomes. Physiological responses, such as heart rate, heart rate variability, and salivary cortisol, have received disproportionately limited attention in CBM-I research, despite their relevance to the social anxiety symptom spectrum. Moreover, previous studies have rarely employed comprehensive experimental designs that directly compare positive, negative, and control training conditions. To address these gaps, the present study compared the effects of three CBM-I training conditions (positive, negative, neutral) on changes in IBs and on self-reported and physiological responses to a standardized laboratory stressor (anagram task). The sample included N = 87 individuals with moderate levels of social anxiety. Results showed that CBM-I successfully modified IB in a condition-congruent direction. However, stress-related outcomes changed similarly over time across all conditions. Self-reported stress and heart rate increased, whereas heart rate variability decreased. Cortisol levels remained unchanged. These findings suggest that although CBM-I can modify IB, such changes may not readily translate into reduced acute stress reactivity. Factors such as training intensity, alignment between training and stressor, and the sensitivity of stress markers may moderate this transfer. Future research should refine CBM-I protocols and measurement approaches to better elucidate the mechanisms linking cognitive change with stress physiology.",

          "abstract": "Dual-process theories posit that reasoning emerges from the interplay of fast, intuitive Type 1 processes and slower, deliberative Type 2 processes, regulated by metacognitive control. Yet despite their influence, these frameworks remain largely verbal and underspecified, limiting their capacity for falsifiable predictions. Here, we introduce a set of computational models that formalise key dual-process assumptions within an evidence-accumulation framework. Each model instantiates distinct mechanisms of working memory, inhibition, and confidence-based regulation and is evaluated against data from two-response bat-and-ball reasoning tasks. Six model variants—ranging from single-process “default” to confidence-regulated architectures—were compared using indices of accuracy, response time, and confidence. All models reproduced core reasoning signatures, but even the simplest captured many qualitative patterns, revealing that common verbal assumptions can be implemented by multiple mechanistic architectures. These findings underscore that while dual-process theories capture essential intuitions about intuitive–analytic dynamics, they remain underdetermined without formal specification. Computational modelling provides the necessary precision to advance dual-process theory from a descriptive dichotomy toward mechanistic explanation.",

          "abstract": "People constantly decide how much time to invest in more versus less rewarding activities. Foraging tasks, during which participants visit contexts with diminishing reward rates, examine this type of decision-making by measuring when individuals choose to switch contexts. It is widely known that humans and other animals perform suboptimally in these tasks. However, the precise nature of this suboptimality, and its links to other behaviourally relevant traits, remain unclear. Here, we developed a foraging task to disambiguate the impacts of initial reward rates and reward rate changes. We investigated how foraging behaviour differs with age and relates to apathy and depression, which are key factors known to influence reward-based decision-making, while controlling for cognitive factors. In addition to overstaying, we found that participants performed more suboptimally as reward decay rate increased, and that many participants expressed a heuristic preference for staying in the single best condition. Moreover, overstaying was strongly associated with higher scaling of stay durations to each condition, and this overstaying/scaling behaviour was positively associated with age but negatively associated with depressive symptoms. No associations were found between foraging behaviour and apathy. Together, our results suggest that people may counterproductively interpret staying in a patch as persistence in reward extraction, which would explain the tight link between overstaying but high sensitivity to reward conditions, and their association with depressive symptoms.",

The camera of the AR HMD captures an image of a real scene out there and the filter is applied to the captured image. Then, the filtered image is shown to an observer wearing the HMD in real-time or near real-time as if the observer is seeing the scene directly. The HMD allows us to use the behavioral techniques to control the brain activity while the observer can move freely. Note also that the AR HMD can be assembled by combining a smartphone and a wearable stereoscope, making it widely available and highly affordable. So, researchers with limited budgets can conduct neuroscience studies and students can learn about these subjects in low-income countries or in underfunded institutions. It can contribute to the democratization of neuroscience and the global equity of scientific research. We developed two AR HMDs with some of the image filters and conducted an observational field study. Applications of the proposed AR HMD are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Significance: Language acquisition is a complex process already influenced by prenatal neural development and auditory experiences. From the third trimester fetuses perceive sounds already influencing the fetal brain. \nAim: The study investigates how the length of intrauterine language exposure, indexed by gestational age (GA), and overall maturation, indexed by birth weight (BW), affect newborns’ brain activations to linguistic stimuli.\nApproach: Data from 14 near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) studies testing responses to different auditory sound patterns in 192 1-4-day-old newborns were pooled together and analyzed to assess the impact of GA and BW on changes in oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbR).\nResults: Results showed that, for HbO, activations in both considered conditions were larger in the Temporal than in the Frontal areas, irrespective of BW or GA. For HbR, increased BW led to more positive, thus less strong, activations in the frontal and more negative, thus stronger, activations in the temporal regions of the left hemisphere, while in the right hemisphere the opposite pattern was observed. Besides, when considering effect sizes reflecting discrimination abilities, these were more strongly associated with BW in the frontal regions, while in the temporal regions they were more strongly associated to GA. Critically, HbR was overall more strongly correlated with prenatal experience and maturation than HbO, challenging the exclusive use of HbO in newborn studies.\nConclusions: The findings suggest a differential impact of BW and GA on brain activations, reflecting their roles in biological maturation and auditory discrimination, respectively. Overall, the study suggests that both the length of prenatal experience and maturation play significant roles in shaping newborns’ hemodynamic responses.",

We address this gap by exploring how people tell personal stories about challenges in network support processes.

Mixed-methods analyses of 900 Reddit posts revealed three major themes: challenges in gaining support from a partner’s friends, in intermediating between one’s partner and friends, and in approving a friend’s relationship; significant differences in gender and couple type (i.e., different-sex vs. same-sex) were found. Linguistic and qualitative analysis revealed three narrative roles: the rejected newcomers, torn middlepersons, and judgmental friends. The findings show network support is a contested communicative process of managing exclusion, negotiating power, and sustaining relational legitimacy.",

          "abstract": "A genre of online videos known as “sludge content” has recently surged in popularity. These videos typically present two clips simultaneously, with one primary and one muted secondary video, creating an intentionally overstimulating viewing experience. Given the reliance on overstimulation and the inherent multitasking demands, these videos raise questions relevant to theories of multimedia learning and cognitive load. Inspired by this content format, we conducted a series of within-person studies to test whether simultaneous split-screen videos lead to changes in comprehension and memory. Across two pre-registered within-person studies (N Study 1 = 75, N Study 2 = 100), we examined whether simultaneous split-screen presentations impaired comprehension or memory. Contrary to predictions, we found no strong evidence that simultaneous video presentation affected memory. We found limited self-reported differences in interest, with higher interest reported for non-split-screen videos in Study 2, but no differences in attention difficulty or cognitive load. These findings suggest that viewers may adapt to split-screen visual input more efficiently than commonly assumed, raising new questions about attention and learning in contemporary multimedia environments.",

The classic Pearson correlation has two strengths: (1) it is\ninvariant to the scale of measurement, and (2) it is invariant to including additional\nvariables in the analysis. However, it is susceptible to attenuation from measurement noise.\nBayesian hierarchical models address this issue by modeling measurement error directly.\nResulting estimates, however, depend on prior specifications and are not invariant to scale\nor variable inclusion. We compare three common priors—Inverse Wishart (IW), Scaled\nInverse Wishart (SIW), and LKJ—to assess robustness to prior assumptions in hierarchical\nsettings. Our main tools are visualizing the priors and evaluating their effects on posterior\nestimates through simulation. When prior settings match ground truth, all priors recover\ntrue correlations accurately in low-dimensional settings. When prior variance is\nmisspecified, the IW shows strong bias: low-variance priors inflate correlations, and\nhigh-variance priors deflate them. The SIW shows the same pattern but less severely, while\nthe LKJ remains largely unaffected by scale misspecification. When more variables are\nadded, the IW is most stable, whereas the SIW and LKJ show slight shrinkage toward\nlower correlations. The main drawback of the LKJ is computational speed—models with it\ncan take orders of magnitude longer than those using IW or SIW. Overall, the LKJ\nprovides the most accurate estimates, while the SIW offers a practical compromise for\nlarge-scale models where computational speed is crucial.",

          "abstract": "Although factor models have been pivotal in understanding the relations among variables, they are difficult to apply to data from experimental designs. In experiments, data are from trials which are nested in conditions, tasks, and individuals. Data at the trial level is quite noisy, so much so that even averages on critical contrasts are subject to excessive measurement error. In this paper, we develop hierarchical factor models where the first level are linear models that account for trial noise and are parameterized with separate, latent individual-by-task scores. The second level consists of factor models on latent individual-by-task scores. Because the model is hierarchical, Bayesian analysis is convenient and conceptually straightforward. We provide development with good computational properties. The advatages of the model are that (a) correlations across tasks may be both disattenuated and localized fairly precisely; (b) uncertainty from both variability in individuals and across trials may be accurately assessed; and (c) factor structures may be recovered even in high-measurement-error contexts. Applications to visual illusions and to cognitive control are included.",

          "abstract": "The Reversed Congruency Effect (RCE) typically observed with gaze targets has been rarely demonstrated with non-social stimuli like arrows targets. In a novel approach, we conducted two pre-registered experiments to investigate whether the RCE can be elicited using non-social stimuli (arrows) when directional information is visually masked. Participants performed a spatial Stroop task with arrows varying in perceptual complexity due to overlapping visual masks. Direction and spatial location were either congruent or incongruent. Remarkably, highly masked arrows elicited an RCE, with faster responses on incongruent trials. Distributional analyses showed reduced interference among the fastest responses and larger RCE in middle quantiles. Additionally, increased errors for both congruent and incongruent conditions were observed in the fastest responses, with congruent trials showing higher error rates, as previously observed with gaze targets. These findings suggest that the RCE reflects a dynamic interplay between early response capture and inhibitory control, shaped by the visual features of masked stimuli. Critically, they raise the possibility that similar perceptual constraints contribute to the RCE observed with gaze targets, offering a potential non-social mechanism underlying this effect. Our results highlight how visual complexity can modulate automatic activation and control processes, underscoring the value of distributional methods for revealing the temporal dynamics of interference.

          "abstract": "We examine vocabulary growth in children aged 14- to 25-months in Ghana (n=937) using a novel 88-word checklist adapted from the CDI Words and Gestures short form with assistance from local consultants. The measure was designed to assess the downstream impacts of an earlier high school education intervention children’s parents had enrolled in as adolescents. Most children were spoken to in a dialect of Akan; half had exposure to at least one other language, most commonly English. Children’s primary caregivers were read a list of 88 vocabulary items in their native language and asked to indicate which items their children say or understand. Caregiver responses were found to have high internal consistency, and most items were effective at distinguishing children by ability. Vocabulary size was significantly and positively related to age, female gender, exposure to multiple languages, and caregiver engagement in stimulating activities, but no significant associations with birth order, caregiver education, or living in an urban setting were found. Children’s vocabulary composition underwent predictable changes over time: children with lower vocabularies tended to know words for people and social routines, while children with higher vocabularies knew more predicates and closed class items. Nouns were over-represented in children’s vocabularies, suggesting the presence of a noun bias. Our results suggest that children in Ghana undergo many similar patterns of development in vocabulary growth as have been found in other languages, reaffirming the usefulness of caregiver-reported language assessments as a tool for studying language acquisition across cultural contexts.",

          "abstract": "Perceiving myself as distinct from others rests upon distinguishing sensations that were generated by “me” from those that were not. Based on computational frameworks developed in the field of motor control, a common assumption is that the evaluation of predicted vs actual movement feedback by comparators is one of the first steps in establishing self-other distinction. In an attempt to uncover the brain areas implementing such comparisons, neuroimaging studies have predominantly used experimental manipulations of visual movement feedback. From these works, three candidate brain regions have emerged for visuomotor comparisons: the angular gyrus (AG), the extrastriate body area (EBA), and the superior temporal sulcus (STS). However, there is an ongoing debate about which of these regions, if any, implements a comparator in the sensorimotor sense; which kind of signals the visual input is compared against, and how dynamic this comparison is. In this mini review, I revisit the assumptions of classical proposals on visuomotor self-other distinction; discuss potential biases resulting from non-motoric cues in the above studies; highlight how differences in kinematic predictability result from different kinds of visual distortion—and how this could be capitalized on; and discuss the potential promises and pitfalls of recent experimental approaches including passive movement generation.",

Across four experiments using a minimal referential communication paradigm, we find that speakers with the explicit goal of signaling social affiliation (1) choose more concise utterances, (2) preferentially select group-specific referents and descriptions, and (3) resist the otherwise strong tendency to be understood by everyone in the audience. Standard models of referential communication that focus on the trade-off between informativity and efficiency cannot explain these patterns; we argue instead for a model where speakers trade off the referential utility of being understood against the social utility of being identified as an in-group member.",

          "authors": "Yi-Lun Weng; Amanda Van Horne; Zhenghan Qi",
          "abstract": "Linguistic prediction, which emerges from acquired knowledge, is a pervasive process in language comprehension. In language acquisition theories, prediction has also been suggested as a key factor driving the implicit learning process. However, how prediction develops as learning unfolds and how it, in turn, drives the learning process remains unclear. This study examines the relationship between prediction and learning, with a focus on three key questions: (1) whether learning leads to prediction, (2) whether prediction motivates learning, and (3) whether individuals’ prediction skills are stable across tasks. We first replicated the malleability of verb bias in adults (Ryskin et al., 2017) and their ability to predict using verb semantics (Nation et al., 2003). Beyond replications, our results revealed that learners who successfully updated their verb biases showed a higher proportion of first fixation to the instruments than to the animals upon hearing an instrument-trained verb, indicating that individuals’ verb bias predictions were modulated by the success of learning, and they were able to use the newly learned verb bias knowledge to generate anticipatory eye movements after training. To understand whether prediction might in turn motivate learning, we found that the more divergent learners’ initial verb bias knowledge was from the received training type, the greater the learning effects occurred, linking prediction errors to learning outcomes. Finally, adults’ ability to predict linguistic items based on verb information remained stable across language tasks. Taken together, these results elucidate the dynamic interplay between prediction and learning, providing empirical support for prediction-based learning frameworks.",

Support Vector Machine regression analysis shows that eco-friendliness ratings are explained almost entirely by overall guest satisfaction, with sustainability indicators contributing little explanatory power. This suggests that ratings conflate general service impressions with perceptions of environmental responsibility, limiting their value as measures of sustainability performance. While plausible explanations such as response biases and the limited salience of many certified practices warrant further research, our findings provide robust evidence that single survey items on eco-friendliness should be interpreted with caution. For platforms and policymakers, the results highlight the need to make sustainability cues more visible and directly tied to the consumer experience if ratings are to support informed choice.",

          "abstract": "In analysing potential policy responses to improve outcomes in collective-action problems, economists often focus on financial disincentives to reduce the expected gains from free-riding and thereby promote within-group cooperation. In this study, we investigate the potential for groups to develop non-financial disincentives to free riding, thereby promoting convergence towards collectively beneficial actions. Using a within-subjects laboratory experiment, participants play two multi-period public-goods games sequentially: without and then with non-financial incentives activated by allowing for the endogenous formation of a social exclusion mechanism. This is operationalised by allowing participants, at a personal cost, to assign exclusion tickets to group members after observing their contributions: the member(s) having accumulated the most in their group gets excluded from a group activity not involving monetary payoffs nor linked to the main game. First, the threat of receiving exclusion tickets, then the threat of being excluded, and finally actually being excluded work as non-financial social disincentives to free ride. Results show that group members who contribute relatively less receive more exclusion tickets. By imposing expected social costs on relatively low contributors, exclusion or the threat of exclusion enables groups to operate with higher contribution levels, thereby reversing the collective decline in contributions observed in the Baseline public good game. Exclusion is experienced by individuals who consistently contribute less than other group members, and this experience amplifies the effectiveness of the subsequent exclusion threat. Willingness to incur personal costs to enhance the exclusion threat increases over time and it is shaped by more cooperative normative expectations. This effect is particularly pronounced among individuals who perceive norms as tight, especially when higher contributions become more dispersed. In the absence of financial disincentives, these patterns show how non-financial incentives, shaped by more cooperative normative expectations, can foster group coordination and higher public-good contributions.",

          "abstract": "Abstract Zhihu.com, as a representative of the Social Question and Answer (SQA) community in China, currently has a very large user base. Experts, scholars and talent from all walks of life are brought together on this network. Compared with other social media websites, the education levels and quality of online users on Zhihu.com are generally high. Young people represent the largest demographic group of users. This dissertation took young people as the research object and analyses their knowledge contribution behaviour in the online SQA community. The study adopted an online observation approach and semi-structured interview methodology. The researcher observed the online knowledge contribution behaviour for an extended period, and conducted in-depth interviews with 25 long-term users. Users were grouped according to gender and age, and the differences in knowledge contribution among these different groups were analysed and compared. The study asked the questions: what characters and personalities do these participants have? Why do participants contribute to the SQA community, and how does contributing to an online SQA forum differ from offline knowledge contributions? Through investigation, the study found that knowledge contributors are enthusiastic and have a strong sense of social responsibility. They are willing to learn and self-motivated. However, even though they may not have a clear purpose in the contribution of knowledge, 6 they help to build their own reputations, broaden social networks and make money eventually. This dissertation attempted to apply Bourdieu’s theory of capital as a framework to explain how users go about accumulating symbolic, economic, cultural and social capital by contributing knowledge. To conclude the study, the researcher drew conclusions concerning the difference between online and offline knowledge contribution on SQA communities.\n\nKeywords: Knowledge Contribution, SQA communities, Social Capital, Prosocial Behaviour",

          "authors": "Aleksei Opacic",
          "abstract": "Firms increasingly drive college graduates' labor market earnings, yet the vast literature on the value-added of college has largely overlooked their role. Drawing on human capital theory and institutional theories of credentialism, closure, and organizational matching, I argue that college-to-workplace pipelines are a critical driver of college value-added. To test this, I assemble a novel US employer-employee matched dataset merged with postsecondary and high school academic records. Firm placement explains much of the variation in earnings premiums between colleges. Absent firm sorting, the range of counterfactual earnings differences across colleges would fall by 56%, and over half of the earnings advantage to attending the state flagship comes from access to higher-paying employers. These sorting effects extend broadly across the distribution of high-wage firms, and not merely a handful of elite employers. Crucially, sorting effects do not simply reflect skill-based advantages, implying that college quality derives as much from institutional linkages to the labor market as from human capital development. Policies aimed at broadening recruitment pipelines, rather than solely improving instructional inputs, are therefore essential to reducing inequalities in the economic returns to higher education.",

          "abstract": "Organization redesign often raises a central question: Where are managers needed? A potential substitute for formal supervision by managers is interpersonal cultural alignment, which can ease coordination between colleagues. Yet prior research suggests cultural alignment may also complement formal structure. We theorize that the balance depends on coordinative complexity: Whether culturally aligned individuals benefit from common supervision hinges on how broadly they depend on others to get work done. Cultural alignment substitutes for formal structure when coordinative complexity is low and complements it when coordinative complexity is high. Focusing on one of the most tangible and consequential forms of cultural alignment---the degree to which individuals are linguistically aligned with their peers in everyday communications---we make predictions about which pairs of colleagues will be brought together under, versus pulled apart from, a shared supervisor. Using archival data from a design firm, we find support for our theory, with effects especially strong when colleagues are highly visible to their senior managers.",

          "authors": "Sehyun Hong; Nak Nyeon Kim; Zhexun Mo; Li Yang; Carolyn Fisher",
          "abstract": "We combine household survey micro data, tax data, and national accounts to construct annual pretax income inequality series for South Korea, which is coherent with macro aggregates. We provide the distribution of pretax national income over the time period from 1933 to 2022, with detailed breakdown by income composition in the years from 1996 to 2022. Our new series demonstrates that Korean top income shares decreased substantially from the 1930s up until the mid-1960s, following various wars, independence and land reform policies. Income inequalities then stabilized against the backdrop of rapid economic growth in the 1970s and 1980s, and decreased even further from the late 1980s onwards until the onset of the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, which contradicts the “Kuznets Curve.” In the aftermath of the crisis, income inequality worsened due to the rise of tax-exempted capital income concentration at the top. Compared to other East Asian countries, South Korea exhibits relatively lower levels of income inequality in terms of higher bottom 50% income shares, mostly due to a more equal distribution of national income growth at the stages of economic take-off in the 1980s, even though income concentration at the very top has strikingly worsened over the last two decades, with its top 1% income shares in 2022 returning back to the peak only observed during the colonial era.

It replicates and expands the 1992 econometric study of the textbook Solow growth model by Mankiw, Romer, and Weil to recent years. Using cross- sectional data, the paper analyzes the impact of saving and population growth, technology and capital depreciation rates on the economic growth of a country. It shows that, in line with the textbook Solow model, higher saving positively affects economic growth, while the population growth rate affects it negatively. However, the paper demonstrates higher values of the OLS estimators of these factors than predicted by the Solow model, which suggests that augmentation of the model is necessary for it to be more successful in explaining the variation in international standards of living.",

          "authors": "Brittany Tarufelli; James Gibson; Sarah Barrows; Abhishek Somani; Daniel Boff",
          "abstract": "Grid-scale energy storage enhances power system performance by shifting loads and supporting capacity, reliability, and transmission. However, as storage penetration increases, arbitrage opportunities—and associated profits—decline (Sioshansi et al., 2009; Li et al., 2024). In ERCOT, for example, 2024 saw reduced arbitrage due to moderate weather and expanded storage. This trend contrasts with findings that long-duration storage is essential for reliability and affordability (Blair et al., 2022), suggesting the need for new business models to capture storage’s full value.  Despite growing deployment in energy storage, empirical research on storage’s value remains limited.\n\nTo address this gap, we develop a commodity-market-based framework and apply it to hydropower as a grid-scale storage resource. Using exogenous variation in reservoir storage volume as a proxy for energy storage, we estimate its causal effect on risk premiums—measured by the day-ahead to real-time price spread—in the Northwestern United States between May 2022 and November 2024. Employing fixed effects and lagged dependent variable models, we control for time-invariant heterogeneity across balancing authorities and account for dynamic price behavior.\n\nWe find that a 10% increase in reservoir storage volume reduces risk premiums by 5%, indicating that hydropower reservoir storage mitigates short-term supply-demand imbalances. Our results are robust to dynamic pricing effects and suggest that storage is especially valuable during grid stress events, with pronounced impacts at the upper end of the price distribution. This result indicates that reservoir storage may be more valuable during grid stress events. As most markets lack compensation mechanisms for stored energy, our findings offer empirical support for designing future models that better reflect the risk-reducing benefits of grid-scale storage.",

Based on qualitative interviews with 12 staff from five INGOs, findings reaffirm critiques of Education in Emergencies’ short-term approach, highlighting its emphasis on provision over impact.

          "abstract": "Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea marked the onset of a systematic repression campaign against the Crimean Tatar population. We introduce CriTaRep v1.0, the first comprehensive, geo-coded event dataset documenting state repression against Crimean Tatars (2014-2024). Drawing on locally sourced materials in Crimean Tatar, Ukrainian, and Russian languages, CriTaRep records n = 690 repression events affecting more than 2,200 individual victims. We inductively identify 22 repression types across three categories: deprivation of liberty, legal and administrative repression, and physical repression. Our data shows a strategic yet adaptive campaign, including a systematic concentration of arbitrary searches on Thursdays, initial physical repression targeting primarily elites, and intensified repression during periods of dissent. Integrating additional disaggregated variables and employing fixed-effects Poisson models, we find that the short-term frequency of repression is significantly driven by protest activity, rather than sanction levels or cultural focal events. Russian authorities respond rapidly and increasingly harshly to dissent, pursuing a dual strategy of immediate protest suppression and long-term deterrence. CriTaRep fills critical gaps in existing datasets and provides new opportunities to study patterns and mechanisms of demographically targeted repression.",

          "abstract": "This proof-of-concept study introduces the Social Morphology Ball, a framework for visualizing multivariate social data as three-dimensional morphological structures. The method normalizes variables using the median and interquartile range (IQR), followed by nonlinear compression with a hyperbolic tangent function to reduce the impact of extreme outliers. Each normalized variable is mapped onto spherical basis functions, transforming numerical relationships into geometric deformations—bulges or concavities—on a sphere. When all variables align with their long-term medians, the model yields a perfect sphere representing a morphologically neutral, structurally balanced state. Implemented in Python, the pipeline automates normalization, shape generation, and visualization, exporting results in STL, PNG, and GIF formats. Applied to Japanese national statistics from 2015–2023, the model captured temporal variations in the balance and distortion of societal indicators through intuitive 3D forms. By interpreting data as morphology rather than numbers, this approach extends social data visualization into a sensory and cognitive domain, providing a conceptual foundation for morphological visualization of social phenomena and potential applications in education, policy, and data-driven art.",

The system proposed is prepared to track, simulate, and optimize building performance using predictive analytics and interactive dashboards, and thus serves as a modular, interoperable solution. By defining a multi-residential site management case study, a working prototype is developed and implemented here using simulated and realistic datasets, thereby designed for real-time calculation and visualization of key performance indicators (KPIs) across various areas, including energy efficiency, preventive maintenance, user experience through design, and economic performance. The choice of KPIs, such as energy usage intensity, return on investment, and user satisfaction, can benefit from this technology setup and yield improvements through enhanced operational efficiency, clearer decision-making, and long-term cost-effectiveness. Although such obstacles exist, empirical testing with real data may reveal that integration with hardware, interoperability with existing setups, and economic costing are feasible for small to medium-sized players. With evaluation performed using simulated data, the platform suggests a prospective setup ready to be tested through pilot testing with real-world deployment. In situating the Smart Infrastructure Metaverse here, as a transformation setup of digital governance within a built and developed framework with technological innovation coupled with sustainability and with inclusivity to all the players/stakeholders, the cities embarked here through ever-increasing digital ecosystems with advantages of having such works through an emerging discussion of how immersive technology informs here of a next-generation potential of smart, sustainable, and participatory urban living.",

However, their structure and functioning remain highly heterogeneous across Europe. This study aimed to develop consensus-based policy recommendations to support their harmonized implementation. \nMethods:\nA two-round Delphi process was conducted among 17 European experts actively involved in MTBs. Questionnaire items were derived from a systematic and scoping review on the clinical impact and implementation aspects of MTBs. Experts rated items on a five-point Likert scale, with consensus predefined as a Content Validity Index (CVI) ≥ 80% of experts agreeing or strongly agreeing (scores 4-5).\nResults:\nAcross two Delphi rounds, 76 items were evaluated. Thirty-six achieved consensus and were consolidated into 15 recommendations across four domains: organizational aspects (n = 8), testing (n = 3), inclusion criteria (n = 2), and clinical aspects (n = 2). Organizational standards emphasized the appointment of a referent clinician, the use of standardized digital submission tools, online meeting formats, and the integration of decision-support systems. The recommended MTB composition was multidisciplinary, including oncologists, molecular biologists, pathologists, geneticists, and other relevant specialists. In the testing domain, experts agreed that NGS should be the preferred approach for molecular profiling, conducted in certified laboratories, with variant interpretation supported by curated databases (e.g., ClinVar, COSMIC, OncoKB). Inclusion criteria prioritized patients with metastatic or rare diseases, ECOG performance status 0–2, life expectancy ≥12 weeks, and exhaustion of standard therapeutic options.\nConclusions:\nThis Delphi consensus produced 15 policy recommendations to standardize and sustain MTBs across Europe. These guidelines complement existing frameworks by providing practical operational guidance for precision oncology implementation.",

          "abstract": "American democracy is entering a period of structural exhaustion. The institutions that once formed citizens and carried meaning, responsibility, and authorship of a common life still function – schools, universities, workplaces, congregations, hospitals, etc. Yet they no longer enable people to govern together and see themselves reflected in the world in any meaningful sense. Civic energy persists, but it leaks through frameworks that can no longer turn that energy into durable public life. The result is not only distrust in government but a deeper collapse of civic faith.\n\nThis paper advances civic architecture as a framework for understanding and repairing the exhaustion – the structural civic breakdown of American institutions. The paper argues that democracy depends not simply on participation but on design: the deliberate construction of institutions that embed authorship, distribute power, and sustain civic responsibility across generations.\n\nDeveloped conceptually through democratic theory, civic studies, and the Black intellectual tradition, the framework is illustrated through an institutional example at Huston–Tillotson University (HT), a Historically Black University (HBCU) in Austin, Texas. There, the Politics Lab of the James L. Farmer House (Farmer House) demonstrates how students and educators can translate frustration into durable authorship, showing what it means to design for democracy within existing institutional life.\n\nDemocracy cannot survive on energy alone.

          "abstract": "While a significant body of scholarly work exists to diagnose the probability of systemic socio-political crises, less attention has been paid to the consequential problem of prognosis: forecasting the character of the regime that emerges from the collapse. This paper addresses this critical gap by proposing a falsifiable theoretical framework for forecasting the post-collapse morphology of political systems. It integrates insights from the structural history of the Annales School, the heuristic use of concepts from depth psychology, and findings from evolutionary psychology to posit that a society operates on three interconnected levels: a rapidly changing socio-cultural \"Operating System\"; a deeper, intermediate layer of universal symbolic patterns, or archetypal \"BIOS\"; and a foundational \"Hardware\" of immutable biological instincts. The framework’s first stage provides a robust diagnosis of systemic instability by measuring the relationship between stress and resilience within the surface \"Operating System.\" The second, and more innovative stage, introduces the Archetypal Activation Index (AAI), a heuristic tool designed to forecast the ideological and psychological DNA of the successor state by analyzing the activation of deep symbolic patterns during a systemic \"reboot.\" The purpose of this paper is thus methodological: to propose a structured framework that shifts the focus from diagnosis to prognosis. Through a detailed examination of the Roman Republic, the English Civil War, and the Weimar Republic, we illustrate how this two-stage analysis can deconstruct the anatomy of historical chaos and provide a more structured understanding of the political forms that emerge from it.",

We find that, on average, nano-targeting does not perform better than an overall \"best message'', but that nano-targeted messages were more persuasive than the best message for individuals who were already supportive of climate action. We also discover backlash effects from \"mis-targeting'', and find an important asymmetry: being randomly assigned messages predicted to be far from one's best policy has stronger dissuasive effects than the persuasive effects of being shown one's best message. Together these results suggest that these technologies may not be practical for most actors, but may be effective for entrepreneurs who aim to dissuade, demobilize or polarize.",

          "abstract": "The paper examines the linguistic and academic life of Bangla-background learners at English-medium institutions in Bangladesh. As English-medium education becomes more popular, many students with a Bangla-speaking background face difficulties in a second-language academic setting. The research focuses on how these students handle language barriers, cultural differences and negotiation of identity in classrooms and social contexts. A qualitative methodology is used, and four Bangla-background students enrolled in different English-medium institutions in Dhaka are interviewed using a semi-structured format. Brief narrations provide information about language use, classroom participation and learning strategies. Thematic analysis identifies common difficulties and coping styles. Findings show that while most students can acquire functional English knowledge, they often struggle with confidence, self-expression, and cultural connection in class. Memorization is widely used due to language gaps; students tend to memorize lessons rather than fully understand them. Peer and teacher support plays an important role in academic achievement. The study highlights the sociolinguistic reality of Bangla-background students in English-medium settings, which is more complex than often assumed. The research suggests the need for more inclusive teaching approaches and policies that consider cultural and linguistic diversity and promote open and supportive language learning environments.",

          "abstract": "Metropolitan areas in the United States are undergoing rapid diversification, significantly reshaping the demographics of local leadership. This paper examines how shifts in the racial and ethnic composition of city councils influence land use and housing development, particularly in relation to decision-making diversity. Using data on city council elections and the distribution of new housing permits, I identify the causal effect of electing a minority representative on housing supply. The findings reveal that minority representation increases single-family housing construction at the expense of multi-family housing, challenging conventional expectations about ideology and race. Qualitative interviews with city council members suggest that efforts to address minority underrepresentation drive active support for single-family housing, while distrust of developers—rooted in fears of gentrification—fuels skepticism toward multi-family projects. Overall, the study presents a nuanced view of racial representation: while minorities achieve better representational outcomes, these gains can come with costs.",

          "abstract": "Historical industrial centers have shifted to the right but have done so at different speeds and intensities. We argue that this variation can be explained by differences in the historical industrialization process. Communities that industrialized later and more intensively realign more toward the radical right today. This is because the built environment shaped by the original industrialization drives demographic persistence and neighborhood disadvantage. To examine our argument, we study the effects of nineteenth-century coal mining in Germany's Ruhr area. We match the geolocation of over 1,000 mining shafts, historical plant-level employment data, and the spread of company housing with contemporary electoral results at the neighborhood level. For identification, we exploit the depth of coal deposits that governed the adoption of deep-shaft mining. The findings demonstrate how the path of economic development influences voting in the long run.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: People with disabilities are underemployed. This improved recently, but how broadly across disability type? US law allows employers to pay people with disabilities far below minimum wage, typically in segregated settings (sheltered workshops), if employers hold federal 14(c) certificates. Almost everyone in 14(c) employment has an intellectual/developmental disability. Some states have eliminated sheltered workshops, and the Biden administration may propose phasing them out. This is controversial.\nOBJECTIVE: To examine employment patterns pre- and post-pandemic among people with disabilities and patterns in use of sheltered workshops.\nMETHOD: We analyzed American Community Survey data on employment rate, by type of disability (or lack of disability), for 2010-2023, Department of Labor data on 14(c) subminimum wage certificates in Community Rehabilitation Programs for 2010-2024, and Department of Labor data on number of workers paid subminimum wages in such programs for 2015-2024.\nRESULTS: American Community Survey data show the disability employment gap narrowing post-pandemic for every disability category—but narrowing especially dramatically for people with cognitive disabilities. Long-term, the employment gap for people with cognitive disabilities narrowed in every state while Department of Labor data show 14(c) enrollment decreasing in every state.\nCONCLUSION: Research to inform public policy and hiring and retention practices should take advantage of the post-pandemic improvement in the employment gap for people with disabilities, especially cognitive disabilities, and marketing investments should promote them.",

          "abstract": "This study reconsiders a classic sociological question: how does space shape intimate ties? Specifically, it examines how the spatial segregation of ethnic groups contributes to patterns of ethnic endogamy. It does so by applying conditional logit models to Swedish population registers describing couples who began cohabiting between 1990 and 2017. The models compare observed unions to counterfactual unions drawn from available singles, distinguishing the effects of ancestry assortativity---based on country of origin---from residential propinquity, while controlling for matching on nativity, education, and age. Proximity strongly predicts partnering, but assortativity matters too, particularly for non-Western groups. Mediation analysis shows that failing to account for propinquity overstates endogamy by 20–40 percent for these groups, with stronger mediation for the most segregated groups. The findings suggest that segregation complements ethnic boundaries in the short term, but also suggest how integration may undermine group boundaries in the longer term.",

This study aims to systematically synthesize and analyze empirical evidence regarding the performance of BAZNAS across three key dimensions: efficiency, effectiveness, and governance, amidst the rapid wave of digitalization. This research employs the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method, following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) protocol. Through a search process across the Scopus, Google Scholar, and SINTA databases, 40 relevant journal articles published between 2015-2025 were identified and analyzed in-depth. The synthesis results show a consensus that BAZNAS is effective in its poverty alleviation programs (as measured by the CIBEST Model and NZI) but faces challenges in operational efficiency (identified via DEA/SFA studies) and uneven implementation of governance. A research gap was found, namely the lack of studies integrating these three performance dimensions to explain their reciprocal relationships. As its main contribution, this study proposes an integrated conceptual framework that positions governance (GCG) as a fundamental independent variable influencing operational efficiency and program effectiveness, with digital technology adoption acting as a moderating variable. This framework can serve as a reference for future empirical research.\nKeywords: BAZNAS, Systematic Literature Review, Efficiency, Effectiveness, Zakat Governance, Conceptual Framework, PRISMA.",

          "abstract": "Recent debates on ‘democratic deconsolidation’ raise three key questions: are younger people less supportive of democracy; where is this occurring; and is the trend worsening? This paper addresses these questions by comparing African and European democracies using five rounds of the Integrated Values Survey and nine rounds of the Afrobarometer. We apply age-period-cohort-interaction models to assess generational support for democracy and openness to authoritarian alternatives; we also differentiate democratic trajectories across regions. In Africa, the dominant pattern is a general downward trend in democratic support and rejection of authoritarianism, in some cases led by younger cohorts. In Europe, although cohort effects continue to reflect declines in democratic support that were concentrated among younger age groups in the past, support for democracy subsequently recovered among more recent cohorts.  However, some European electoral democracies show a rise in openness to authoritarianism, especially among young cohorts.",

Mainstream climate governance often casts adaptation as a technical\nadjustment to biophysical hazards, but such framings risk naturalizing inequality by obscuring\nthe longue-durée histories of extraction and dispossession that have structured vulnerability.\nDrawing on multi-sited ethnographic research in coastal, agrarian, and urban communities in\nSierra Leone, this paper introduces the concept of counteradaptation to illustrate how people\nnavigate not only environmental volatility but also the antagonistic pressures generated by\n(neo)colonial systems. Counteradaptation highlights how adaptive moves in one domain—\nwhether foreign extraction, ‘development’ apparatuses, or climate policy regimes—create new\npressures that compel situated responses elsewhere. Case studies of fishing communities, timber\nand gold frontiers, and informal urban settlements show how counteradaptation reframes\nhabitability as a contested threshold and exposes the limits of technocratic adaptation toolkits. By\nsituating climate response within histories of coloniality and predatory accumulation,\ncounteradaptation offers a novel analytic for understanding ‘environmental’ behavior.",

          "authors": "Abel Aussant",
          "abstract": "Over the last decade, states throughout Europe have begun implementing universal culture vouchers for young adults to boost cultural participation. Little is known about the effects of these large-scale subsidies, specifically whether they are truly an effective means of widening participation. This article addresses this question by evaluating the French ‘pass Culture’, a €300 stipend for cultural consumption offered to all 18-year-olds. Drawing from the fields of the sociology of culture and cultural economics, this study aims to determine whether an increase in purchasing power for cultural goods can influence participation. The empirical analysis is based on an econometric examination of a large-scale survey examining cultural participation and the use of ‘pass Culture’. The results reveal that while the voucher does not affect participation in institutional highbrow cultural activities like museum visits, theater, or opera attendance, it significantly increases engagement with commercial popular culture, including cinema and comic book reading. These findings suggest that financial barriers are not the primary obstacle to consumption in cultural capital-intensive activities. However, financial constraints do appear to contribute to non-participation in popular cultural life among certain youth demographics. The article then discusses the theoretical implications of these findings for our understanding of the relationship between cultural consumption, cultural policies, and social inequalities.",

          "authors": "William Fernandez",
          "abstract": "In the developed world, efforts are underway to extend working lives. However, discussions often overlook the potential implications of  retirement for individual well-being. While the relationship between retirement and life satisfaction has been extensively studied, the effects of spousal retirement remain underexplored, particularly from a gender and timing perspective. This paper examines the impact of retirement on self-reported life satisfaction among couples in Germany. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), I employ standard fixed-effects (FE) models and fixed-effects individual slopes (FEIS) to estimate the causal effects of personal and partner retirement on life satisfaction. The findings show that retirement substantially increases life satisfaction, a result that remains robust across methodologies and specifications. For partner retire￾ment, accounting for heterogeneous trends by health status reveals an overall positive effect, driven by men. Moreover, women appear to be worse off when their husbands retire while they remain in the workforce, whereas the opposite holds for men. To my knowledge, this is the first study to examine the impact of both personal and spousal retirement on life satisfaction using the SOEP. The results provide robust evidence that partner retirement affects life satisfaction, highlighting the importance of understanding retirement as a life course event with intra-household spillover effects that extend beyond the retiring individual.",

          "abstract": "Population aging and increasing family diversity raise concerns about women’s financial security in later life, as a greater share do not live with a breadwinning spouse. Women’s financial security is particularly jeopardized in conservative welfare states that limit women’s options to accrue independent pension entitlements. This study examines women’s work–family life courses and financial security in later life in two conservative welfare states with distinct pension policies: West Germany with a Bismarckian pension system and the Netherlands with a more universalistic pension system. Drawing on SHARELIFE data, we apply multichannel sequence and cluster analysis, and regression methods to link work-family life course typologies to individual pensions, survivor benefits, and household equivalence income. Findings show that the work-family life courses in the two countries strongly resembled each other, characterized by a strong care orientation and weak labour force attachment of married mothers. However, women with care-oriented life courses receive substantially higher individual pensions in the Netherlands, which grant Dutch women higher financial autonomy. In contrast, women’s survivor benefits and household income were slightly higher in West Germany, affording a higher living standard but less financial autonomy, and a higher risk of poverty following a potential separation compared to the Netherlands.",

The scale of the biodiversity crisis and the enduring popularity of nature markets means it is now critical to stop reproducing the same mistakes. Here we synthesise international research from the history of nature markets and summarise five rules which are necessary precursors for achieving their environmental aims. We propose a checklist for investors, policymakers, and civil society to assess whether nature markets are likely to be delivering scientifically-credible outcomes. We score the world’s largest nature markets against these rules and show all face integrity risks. Lastly, we outline critical evidence-based actions that can be taken to push nature markets towards greater integrity.",

Hacking is a creative research method and mode of critical play that involves participants unmaking and remaking games by doing things like changing the game rules, creating new components, making new pieces for the game, or new art, and combining the different elements of the game in new ways. This experience was messier than we had envisaged when designing and pitching the project for our funders, Game in Lab and the Libellud Foundation, who are industry-based funding bodies promoting the scientific study of games. The semi-contained chaos in the room punctured the confidence of our written research proposal, which naïvely described a neatly complementary interaction of games and young researchers. This chapter is a reflection on what we learned as researchers, and an examination of the relationships that unfolded between research, game hacking and activism.",

          "abstract": "How do authoritarian regimes implement unpopular economic reforms without triggering destabilizing unrest? Prevailing theories suggest that governments must either repress dissent, concede through meaningful policy reversals, or ignore unrest and risk backlash. This paper introduces the concept of temporary concessions: short-term, strategic policy reversals later re-implemented to demobilize protest while maintaining reform and regime stability. I argue that regimes deploy temporary concessions when repression is costly or externally constrained, and ignoring protest risks escalation. By disrupting protest momentum and introducing a collective action problem among protesters, tem porary concessions make demobilization the individually rational choice. Evidence from subsidy reforms in Jordan and Egypt, combined with a nationally representative survey experiment, shows that these tactics defuse unrest even when citizens doubt their durability, challenging prevailing models of authoritarian responsiveness and resilience under economic liberalization.",

          "abstract": "Climate change and the depletion of the Earths natural resources are among the largest challenges humanity currently faces. In light of this, the planned German Longitudinal Environmental Study (GLEN) aims at investigating the incentives, restrictions, attitudes, and beliefs that underlie human-environment interactions. In doing so, the GLEN project aims to provide a foundation for evidence-based environmental policy assessments and guidance. The project will build up a large-scale panel study of the adult population in Germany in which the same individuals will be repeatedly observed over time using a standardized and stable online survey instrument. Due to its longitudinal design and the linkage of the collected survey data to geospatial information on respondents social and ecological environments, the panel will be well suited to analyzing natural experiments such as regional policy measures (e.g., price changes, information campaigns) and exposure to local environmental conditions (e.g., extreme weather events). In addition, the panel\nwill be used as a platform for survey experiments to investigate trade-offs in environmental preferences, consumption decisions, and the acceptance of environmental technologies and policies. With this design, GLEN will meet the urgent need for data suitable for causal research and simulations in the environmental social sciences. With occasionally refreshed samples, it will also allow for the monitoring of trends in environmental concern and behavior, focusing on diverse social, political, economic, and psychological aspects. Accordingly, GLEN is primarily understood as a data infrastructure for environmental research across all social science disciplines. Key questions that can be addressed with the data include: What influences environmental concern, behavior, and the acceptance of technologies and policies to protect the environment? What consequences do environmental policies and changing environments have for social inequalities, and how does that affect (perceived) environmental justice? As a long-term project, GLEN will cover the period between 2024 and 2035, and thus the period in which decisive policy measures to replace fossil fuels are set to be implemented in accordance with international agreements. In sum, the project includes three work streams to pursue three closely related goals: (I) First and foremost, the project will generate a data infrastructure for the environmental social sciences, to be used not only in Germany, but also internationally. (II) The project team will utilize the data for substantive environmental social science research. (III) The project will provide evidence-based policy evaluations and guidance with regular policy reports and embedded experiments. The project team requests funding for the first 3-year period of the planned long-term project.",

These tools are now ubiquitously and instantly accessible, e.g., via smartphones, and the quality of their translations has markedly improved. When used in informal and institutional, spontaneous as well as planned contexts between individuals and groups without a common language or lingua franca, these translation tools create new and unique contexts for interaction that would not otherwise exist. This development has generated a novel genre of research settings essential for exploring intercultural communication, as they foster new forms of interculturality, enabling new experiences, and raise new ethical questions about intercultural interaction. Consequently, AI-translated intercultural communication has emerged as a new basis for the development of interculturality. The current research overview indicates that this phenomenon remains largely unexplored, with significant research questions and areas still unaddressed. Existing studies focus on the technical aspects of machine translation, the feasibility and limitations of achieving human-like, accurate translation, and the future role of human translators. The active role of translation tools in creating novel intercultural contact situations urgently requires further investigation and exploration.",

The framework proposed in this research can become a more comprehensive reference source for future studies in sustainable food consumption topics.

Sources of inquiry into current practice, learning, and experience which may shape reform of providing good foot care with and for First Nations Peoples in the land now known as Australia are health practitioners working in the space. This work seeks to explore foot care service delivery by investigating First Nations and non-Indigenous health practitioners’ perspectives regarding providing foot care with and for First Nations Peoples. \nMethods: Ways of working are documented in previous work; ‘Working right ways in foot health with and for First Nations Peoples: research method guided and governed by First Nations ways of knowing, being, and doing in cross-sectional qualitative study design’. Four First Nations and six non-Indigenous health practitioners provided perspectives with culturally responsive semi-structured interviews guiding talking with consenting participants. Analytic induction utilised First Nations expertise, inductive reasoning, and constant comparison method in thematic analysis.\nResults: Two talking points engaged health practitioners’ perspectives of providing foot care with and for First Nations Peoples: (1) What does foot health mean to you as a First Nations or non-Indigenous health practitioner? (2) What are needs for providing good foot care with and for First Nations Peoples? Within responses, themes emerged of mobility, overall wellbeing, and advocacy being related to the meaning of foot health. The requirements of Cultural Safety, workforce, and holistic care were perceived as needed for provision of good foot care with and for First Nations Peoples.    \nConclusion: Participants described a meaning of foot health relational to physical and spiritual constructs, and central to reclamation of, and continuation of, First Nations cultures; amidst a project of ongoing colonisation. Needs for good foot care provision with and for First Nations Peoples included a workforce continually learning and unlearning to develop cultural capabilities to work with and for, and support, First Nations foot health. This study provides qualified voiced lived experience of health practitioners working in the space which the podiatry profession must listen to and receive direction and learning from.",

          "abstract": "Research that purports to engage communities has become more mainstream, presenting an imperative to thoughtfully engage ethical principles that grapple with on-the-ground complexities of the work. Here we reflect on learnings from an eight-year, community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership in British Columbia, Canada that addressed the ongoing public health emergency of toxic drug-related deaths in a semi-urban and rural setting. This challenging research context provides a methodological petri dish from which to examine common ethical challenges inherent in CBPR work. Here we discuss how praxis aligned with the concepts of relationality, embeddedness and embodiment contain both tension and promise in complex research contexts. We depict how relational authenticity was facilitated by flexibility and informal interactions and was further enhanced by deeply-engaged, physical presence that enkindled hope even when hope was hampered by limited agency. We also present commensality as a promising methodological tool.",

          "authors": "Issam Rian",
          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate feedback in L2 writing, yet little is known about how such output reshapes learners’ decision-making. This qualitative multiple-case study examines how genre-based ChatGPT feedback and dialogue shape novice L2 writers’ metacognitive judgments (MJs)—their basis, accuracy, and evolution—and how these judgments, in turn, drive self-regulated learning (SRL). In a first-year composition course for international students, nine participants completed three genre-based assignments and engaged in structured, AI feedback cycles using a custom GPT, Genre Guru, designed to provide genre-specific feedback. Data sources included AI-feedback reflections, ChatGPT interaction logs, end-of-course reflections, and five post-semester interviews. Using thematic analysis, MJs were traced across the four domains of genre-specific knowledge (formal, rhetorical, process, subject-matter) and mapped onto the phases of SRL (forethought, performance, self-reflection). Four themes emerged: (1) students moved from initial skepticism to measured trust; (2) learners critically evaluated and selectively adopted AI suggestions, preserving text ownership; (3) writers integrated the four domains and articulated genre awareness; and (4) emotions and motivation drove self-regulatory cycles. Findings suggest that, when framed by genre theory and embedded in reflective dialogue, LLM-mediated feedback can function as a catalyst for AI-calibrated metacognition: enhancing judgment quality, scaffolding regulation, and expediting adaptive, autonomous L2 writing without displacing human intelligence and agency.",

Tax compliance was strikingly high, with about 80 percent of liable taxpayers meeting obligations despite limited administrative capacity. Military recruitment targets were likewise consistently met despite avoidance and poor health. Spikes in head tax rates significantly increased tax-related protests, prompting colonial authorities to moderate rates in times of crisis and adjust burdens to perceived district affluence. Yet local shocks such as droughts or crop price collapses were largely ignored. (Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality Working Paper)",

Many IOs assume a trade-off between expertise and representation, where the former increases capacity and the latter increases legitimacy. However, this paper provides evidence that geographic representation can enhance bureaucratic information capacity. Using the European Commission's Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs as a case study, I provide evidence that increasing representation of bureaucrats from a member state increases the accuracy of that state's economic forecasts. This effect, which I call ``national expertise,\" decreases as member state representation within the Commission increases and is most pronounced for large economies. These findings highlight that prioritizing geographic balance in IOs may positively impact both legitimacy and capacity.",

We implement a pre-registered field experiment embedded in a real-world citizens’ assembly on wealth inequality in Austria. Using a three-group-design comparing assembly participants, non-selected volunteers, and a population sample, we isolate the causal effects of taking part in a citizens’ assembly from self-selection into participation. We find that while participating in the citizens’ assembly substantially improves factual knowledge about the wealth distribution and promotes convergence around specific tax policy proposals, notably a EUR 1 million allowance, it has no measurable effect on political efficacy or broader civic engagement. We also document significant political self-selection: individuals willing to participate in the citizens’ assembly were already more engaged and supportive of redistribution than the general population. These findings suggest that while deliberative formats can foster informed convergence on policy proposals, their ability to mobilize broader publics is limited – especially if they primarily engage the already supportive and, as in this case, lack institutional anchoring that might facilitate spillover into more institutionalized political arenas.

          "abstract": "Writing in the sciences transcends the notion of sticking to the data. Writing is a complex transformation of a wealth of semi-ordered information into a clear and persuasive scientific story. The formalised form of a research article contains this story and, if published, legitimises it. This empirical study provides a nuanced, empirically-driven appreciation of scientific writing before writer and text are mediated by the competition for and accounting of authorship. It builds on a qualitative study of writing (n=22) and elucidates essential features of writing such as the hermeneutics of the scientific story, different modes of writing as iteration and collaboration, spanning across levels of seniority and position. Furthermore, this study delivers a new perspective on professional scientific writers—trained scientists who provide writing-as-a-service but often remain invisible in attributions of authorship. The structure of this article is as follows. The introduction provides an overview of the literature and elaborates the central research questions (1). We then define our area of research in terms of actors and discuss our research design (2). Thereafter (3), we present and contextualise empirical findings along central themes such as: the writing journey, the division of labour in scientific writing, the meaning of style and storytelling, the relation of writing practices and authorship, and the position of the scientific writer. Finally (4), we conclude, expounding on the intermediatory functions of scientific writing in the broader context of knowledge production, and provide a comprehensive outlook.",

          "abstract": "Editorial boards function as gatekeepers in academic publishing, yet systematic frameworks for quantifying how symbolic capital concentrates within editorial networks remain absent. This study operationalizes Bourdieu’s symbolic capital theory through network analysis of 2,135 editorial positions across 30 sustainability science journals. Eigenvector centrality measures symbolic capital as prestige derived from connections to other prestigious positions, while Gini coefficients assess distributional inequality. Among 71 interlocking editors (those holding multiple board positions), women comprise only 22.5%, and scholars from Western Europe and North America dominate both numerically and structurally: editors with the highest eigenvector centrality are concentrated almost exclusively in these regions, while Latin America and Africa contribute only two interlocking editors each. A two-dimensional typology combining median eigenvector centrality with Gini coefficients distinguishes four configurations of symbolic capital across journals: concentrated core, dispersed core, concentrated periphery, and dispersed periphery. Critically, journals’ positions in editorial interlock networks align only partially with their citation-based intellectual centrality, demonstrating that governance structures and knowledge networks represent distinct dimensions of academic power. This reproducible analytical framework enables systematic comparison of editorial governance structures across fields.",

Using CPI components and CPS/OEWS wages across six metros, we show how TIMW stabilizes MSH near target while EHTC backstops D1–D3 renters during shocks, delivering a dual-key hours guarantee without price controls.

          "abstract": "In recent years, Europe has experienced an increasing number of devastating floods. In 2023 alone, 26 flood events were reported in the first nine months of the year. Two of such events were the floods that hit the Italian regions of Emilia Romagna in May 2023 and Tuscany in November 2023. Using an original survey instrument on a representative sample of the Italian population of residents in Emilia Romagna and Tuscany, we investigate individuals’ climate adaptation and mitigation responses, including their preparedness against extreme climatic events and the determinants of such preparedness, their perception of flood risk likelihood across key life domains, their support for green policies, and their intention to adopt mitigation measures. We further examine whether targeted risk communication can enhance these climate adaptation and mitigation responses through two pre-registered randomized experiments testing the causal impact of flood risk information on the same set of outcomes. Our findings reveal that respondents were highly unprepared, with around 70% per cent of the sample having never taken any action to equip their home to handle extreme climatic events. The experimental results demonstrate that the provision of information on floods’ risk through an effective video message significantly improves individuals’ pro-environmental behavior, their perception of the danger of floods, and their intention to vote for a political coalition that will prioritize on combating climate change. Providing information on flood risk can thus contribute to promoting the vast support for the necessary actions to address the climate crisis.",

Existing research shows that sexism may be a stronger predictor of political attitudes and voting behaviour than a voter’s gender. To what extent do the findings from the US presidential elections apply to other contexts and research questions? To answer this question, we present a systematic review of studies focusing on sexism as a predictor of political attitudes and voting behaviour. In two databases (Scopus and Web of Science), we identify 97 relevant studies, including 42 on the 2016 US presidential elections. The review shows that particularly modern and hostile sexism played a role in Trump's election. However, few other research questions have been answered with similar certainty. Our review discovers gaps in the literature and proposes further directions for this growing research field. To enable future comparative research, we discuss best practices for measuring sexism and show the variety of ways in which sexism is operationalized.",

          "abstract": "Dementia is a major challenge in our aging society. Apart from its health economic impact, cognitive decline may affect the quality of life (QoL) and affective states of individuals. From a measurement perspective, it is of high importance to use quality-assured measurements to derive valid and reliable results. This paper investigates to what extent improved memory metrics can be exploited to investigate the strength of correlation between memory ability, depressive symptoms, and well-being. It also aims to shed light on earlier heterogeneous results through the application of quality-assured measurements. In this paper, we analyzed associations between memory ability, measured by the new and more accurate NeuroMET Memory Metric (NMM), and depressive symptoms and wellbeing of the same individuals measured using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the WHOQoL-BREF of older individuals (n=332, ranging from healthy controls to patients with dementia due to suspected Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), with a mean age of 72 years). While decreased memory ability was moderately associated with more depressive symptoms (Pearson R = -0.36), it was only negligibly associated with worse well-being (associations with WHOQoL-BREF and subdomains ranging between R = 0.08 and 0.12), which is partly in line with previous studies. A group-wise analysis revealed that these effects were stronger for individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Our study leveraged measurements scales and models with improved accuracy.",

Central to the narrative is the concept of “huggerholics”—residents who welcome warmth and affectionate gestures—and the emotional reciprocity this role offers. This piece highlights how aged care work, especially in hospitality roles, can be a source of meaning and healing, not just for those being served but also for those serving. Through this reflection, I hope to contribute to a richer understanding of person-centred care and the importance of emotional labour in aged care settings.",

          "abstract": "The Multicultural Systems Approach (MSA) proposes a shift from viewing culture as a set of static, national traits toward understanding it as a dynamic system of interdependent cultural logics operating within organizations. Building upon general systems theory, intercultural management, and organizational behavior, the MSA conceptualizes multicultural interaction as the negotiation of equilibrium among diverse cultural subsystems, each with distinct assumptions about hierarchy, communication, time, and coordination.\nUnlike established frameworks such as Hofstede’s dimensions or the GLOBE project, the MSA emphasizes interactional dynamics and feedback loops rather than categorical differences. It accounts for how multicultural teams and institutions co-create hybrid cultural orders, shaping both performance and cohesion. This article introduces the theoretical architecture of MSA, clarifying its axioms, levels of analysis, and principles of Cultural Alignment. By reframing intercultural management through a systemic lens, MSA contributes to theory by explaining how and why multicultural collaboration succeeds or fails—and provides an integrative platform for future empirical research on cultural systems in organizations.",

Drawing analogies from marine strandings, it interprets socio-political extremism as a product of affective and informational imbalance. The proposed Tensional Realignment Model (TRM) offers a neurocognitive explanation for how societies recalibrate emotional, temporal, and structural equilibrium through distributed tension management. Integrating insights from affective neuroscience, ecological systems theory, and social dynamics, the study situates nationalism as an emergent symptom of affective compression under digital acceleration. By comparing the global diffusion of the MAGA movement with the evolution of Japanese online nationalism, the paper frames digital populism as a “magnetic realignment failure.” The TRM thus proposes a post-national governance approach that sustains adaptability and emotional diversity by restoring systemic oscillation between affective and informational poles.",

          "abstract": "This study argues that a payment’s risk approaches zero as maturity approaches zero, and that the central bank’s short-term rate best captures the risk-free rate of various assets. Expecting that the T-bill risk largely reflects a country’s inflation risk or macrorisk, we measure the risk as a one-year payment’s risk to be comparable across various assets. We that the risk-free rate reflects the expected inflation effect, and that the inflation risk reflects the unexpected inflation effect or the investment opportunity cost. To simplify the formulas, we also examine if the two returns can be computed independently. We employ two factors to model the risk-free rate, which the market expects the current monetary policy to bring towards the neutral level over a certain period. The 4-factor models include a risk constant over maturity to capture the depreciation cost of inter-bank short-term lending. We thus use different models to split T-bill returns into the risk and the risk-free rate with repeated trials to minimize the prediction errors, thereby solving the model factors. The 4-factor independence model outperforms all the other models on average explaining 99.3% of the US T-bill returns. The T-bill metrics is the gateway to the risks of various corporate assets. We have to develop the 4-factor independence model into software to analyze the noise of the risk and the risk-free rate that follows a blended normal distribution of Nie (2023).",

          "authors": "George Y. Nie",
          "abstract": "Markowitz (1952) asset risk (MAR) has long been challenged. First, as an impostor of asset risk, volatility captures the noise of asset risk over maturity that improperly reflects asset risk (which has to be measured over a unit of time length to be cumulative since asset holder’s risk approaches zero as the holding time length approaches zero). Second, we argue that asset risk approaches zero as distance approaches zero, and that asset risk drives volatility, but not vice versa, implying that asset risk cannot be diversified away. Third, support to MAR appears to arise from a confusion between asset value and wealth utility: the law of diminishing marginal utility supports that volatility reduces the latter. The above causes explain why CAPM and Fama-French models have long been struggling to price asset volatilities. To address the challenges, we propose that the gross volatility (variance), which includes the excess risk ALPHA, of realized (expected) asset value approaches zero as distance approaches zero. We delineate expected asset value (which asset risk impacts without a distribution) and risk volatility (which does not affect the former while following a blended normal distribution we proposed). Our asset risk for a specific asset excludes the macrorisk in Nie (2024a) that is tied to assets with a face value denominated by the currency. We show that equity price is the present value of a spanning bond, a payment spanning over the predictable lifetime of firm performance, and that options are equity bonds. Our examples show how to compute a firm’s debt and equity risk. Our asset risk, captured as risk premium, solves issues that have long been challenging agency theories, thereby redefining firm misvaluation theory.",

          "abstract": "A paradox of hominization needs to be resolved: Homo erectus experienced a\ndoubling of brain volume, yet the development of its cognition took eons. In almost\ntwo million years of brain growth, Homo erectus made only a few technological\ninnovations. Therefore, in Homo erectus, it seems that the biological process\nof mutation and selection for the evolution of the cerebrum was primarily\nresponsible for the increase in cognition, rather than the accumulation of experience.\nThe only significant difference between the monkey and human brain is as follows:\nthe proportion of the association cortex increased to 80% during the evolution\nof Homo erectus. But how can a mere increase in the number of non-specific\nneurons in the association cortex of Homo erectus explain the cognitive advances\nthat can be observed? The partial patterns of sensory perception that the connectome\nfeeds to the association cortex are evolved intracortically into higher cognitions\nby means of unspecialized neurons. These information-providing neural patterns\ncan only be evolved – not calculated – because they are subject to the properties\nof a complex brain system; and they can only be evolved processual because\nthe association cortex has a non-specific character – it selects information patterns\ninstead of neural structures.\nThus, the greater the number of neurons, the more pattern attractors of order acquisition\ncan be formed, and the higher the cognition. Their number was probably\nnot sufficient in Homo erectus to continuously develop complex cognition. The\nextreme time periods for innovations in Homo erectus therefore suggest that its\ncognitive advances were not due to a cumulative learning process, but primarily\nto the genetically determined increase in brain size and thus neurons. Homo erectus\nwas not human.\nBefore brain growth stopped in archaic Homo sapiens, a systemic change must\nhave taken place in the evolving cerebrum. For in the human brain – which remains\nconstant – we recognize an unlimited potential for cognition and, above all,\ncreativity that is lacking in Homo erectus.",

          "abstract": "American democracy is entering a period of structural exhaustion. The institutions that once formed citizens and carried meaning, responsibility, and authorship of a common life still function – schools, universities, workplaces, congregations, hospitals, etc. Yet they no longer enable people to govern together and see themselves reflected in the world in any meaningful sense. Civic energy persists, but it leaks through frameworks that can no longer turn that energy into durable public life. The result is not only distrust in government but a deeper collapse of civic faith.\n\nThis paper advances civic architecture as a framework for understanding and repairing the exhaustion – the structural civic breakdown of American institutions. The paper argues that democracy depends not simply on participation but on design: the deliberate construction of institutions that embed authorship, distribute power, and sustain civic responsibility across generations.\n\nDeveloped conceptually through democratic theory, civic studies, and the Black intellectual tradition, the framework is illustrated through an institutional example at Huston–Tillotson University (HT), a Historically Black University (HBCU) in Austin, Texas. There, the Politics Lab of the James L. Farmer House (Farmer House) demonstrates how students and educators can translate frustration into durable authorship, showing what it means to design for democracy within existing institutional life.\n\nDemocracy cannot survive on energy alone. It requires form.",

          "abstract": "Social media platforms (SMPs) such as Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok are increasingly scrutinized for employing attention-extractive algorithms to maximize users’ time on the platform. This study draws on the concept of political consumerism to explore how users protest against SMPs by strategically withdrawing or applying their attention for ethical reasons. Results of a pre- registered survey (n= 5,685) across six countries (Brazil, Germany, Japan, South Korea, the UK, and the US) suggest that negative attitudes towards AI-based recommender systems and distrust in social media companies are most strongly associated with algorithmic resistance. A comparative analysis further reveals that users from Brazil are least likely to disengage from SMPs on ethical grounds. The paper also presents a natural experiment investigating political consumerism towards Twitter/X and the open source alternative Mastodon before and after Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter/X. The results show that this event induced no immediate shifts in user behavior.",

          "abstract": "We present an agent-based simulation of democratic decision-making in which autonomous learning agents interact under alternative electoral institutions and social structures. The model integrates six voting mechanisms (Plurality, Approval, Borda, IRV, STV, PR with D'Hondt and Sainte-Laguë divisors), a multi-round coalition protocol with binding/non-binding contracts and side-payments, turnout and ballot-error realism, and networked interaction on Erdös–Rényi, Barabási–Albert, and Watts–Strogatz graphs with homophily. Agents use reinforcement learning algorithms (PPO, A2C, A3C) with a social-welfare objective based on the inequality-averse Atkinson function, augmented by fairness regularizers (representation loss, participation fairness, envy-freeness proxy) and explicit participation costs. We report diagnostics-rich evaluations covering representation and proportionality (e.g., Gallagher, Loosemore–Hanby), fragmentation (effective number of parties), strategic behavior, coalition stability, and welfare/inequality. Classic regularities emerge—e.g., two-bloc competition under Plurality (Duverger-consistent), greater proportionality and fragmentation under PR, and differential seat allocation under D'Hondt vs Sainte-Laguë—providing face validity. The framework delivers a reproducible virtual laboratory for mechanism comparison, institutional design, and welfare–fairness trade-off analysis at population scale.",

          "abstract": "The aim of this interdisciplinary study is to contribute to the field of disaster and climate conflict research. For this purpose, I qualitatively examine for the first time the impact of the devastating flood of 2010 on the conflict in Pakistan, more specifically the regional capacity of the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), in the administrative units of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (KPK). Also, I introduce the concept of state capacity into the debate, review its impact on the conflict and examine its possible contribution to the debate. I hypothesise that the concept of state capacity can explain the conflict better than the influence of disasters. This is tested with the help of a document analysis and expert interviews. Prior findings from mostly quantitative studies, such as the complex, bidirectional nature of the relationship between disasters and conflict or the concept of the unnatural disaster, were qualitatively confirmed and further explored in this study. It becomes clear that while the flood can provide benefits to the TTP and prolong the conflict, it cannot fundamentally change the outcome of the conflict. In this context, the key finding of this study is the importance of state capacity for the complex debate around disasters and climate conflict. More research in this direction is recommended, as the topic is expected to become much more relevant due to the increasing number and intensity of extreme weather events in the coming decades.",

Many IOs assume a trade-off between expertise and representation, where the former increases capacity and the latter increases legitimacy. However, this paper provides evidence that geographic representation can enhance bureaucratic information capacity. Using the European Commission's Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs as a case study, I provide evidence that increasing representation of bureaucrats from a member state increases the accuracy of that state's economic forecasts. This effect, which I call ``national expertise,\" decreases as member state representation within the Commission increases and is most pronounced for large economies.

          "authors": "Gijs Custers",
          "abstract": "The role of media in producing territorial stigma is a central concern for urban researchers. This study investigates how one of the most stigmatised areas in the Netherlands, the Bijlmer, has been portrayed in newspaper media over a period of 35 years, and how this portrayal relates to structural changes in the district. The concepts of core and event stigma are employed to understand the temporal dimensions of stigma production. The corpus includes 22,934 articles from the five largest Dutch newspapers that referenced the Bijlmer since 1990. Hierarchical topic modelling and sentiment analysis are used to detect topical representations of the Bijlmer. The findings indicate that in the 1990s two news peaks regarding the Bijlmer crash have been important in raising its (inter)national status, whereas the Bijlmer has also suffered from core stigmatisation on various crime and social issues. In addition, the findings suggest an intricate relation between structural changes in the Bijlmer and media attention. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating the relevance of core and event stigma, employing novel techniques in research on territorial stigma, and investigating the relation between structural neighbourhood conditions and media representation.",

Covering an area of 31,842 km², it extends between the Andes Mountains and the Pacific Ocean, encompassing a diversity of ecosystems that support agricultural, forestry, and tourism activities. The region, composed of the provinces of Cautín and Malleco, has a population of 1,010,423 inhabitants (Census 2024) and holds the highest proportion of Indigenous population in the country, with 34.5% belonging to the Mapuche people. This deeply rooted cultural presence is central to the region’s identity and to ongoing debates about autonomy and ancestral rights. However, La Araucanía faces persistent structural challenges, including high multidimensional poverty rates, pronounced urban–rural disparities in access to basic services, and an economy highly concentrated in primary sectors. This report provides a comprehensive characterization of the region, examining its productive structure, labor market, consumption patterns, foreign trade, innovation landscape, and economic projections.

          "authors": "Thi Xuan Dieu Phan",
          "abstract": "Food is central to the dignity, well-being, and quality of life of older adults living in residential aged care. Yet in many facilities, food waste remains widespread and under-addressed, often viewed as inevitable in institutional settings. This study offers a reflective, practice-based exploration of food waste in aged care, grounded in the author’s work as a catering assistant and support worker across multiple facilities in South Australia. Drawing on structured fieldnotes and direct observations, the paper identifies three main categories of food waste—plate waste, kitchen overproduction, and expired stock—and explores the operational, cultural, and behavioural factors driving these inefficiencies. Key causes include inaccurate meal ordering, overproduction habits, limited staff feedback mechanisms, and poor interdepartmental communication. The study proposes a set of low-cost, staff-informed strategies to reduce waste while enhancing care quality. These include personalised portioning, consistent ordering protocols, resident feedback loops, and systems for safe food repurposing. It also underscores the importance of supportive leadership, workplace culture, and valuing catering roles as central to person-centred care. By centring frontline staff experiences, this paper reframes food waste as not merely a logistical issue, but a matter of care quality, communication, and organisational sustainability. Findings suggest that food waste reduction can reinforce—not compete with—person-centred approaches by respecting resident preferences and improving mealtime satisfaction. This study contributes to the broader conversation on aged care reform by offering insights from daily practice. It highlights how simple, context-sensitive changes can advance both environmental and social goals in residential care.",

We test two implementable policies: a Time-Indexed Minimum Wage (TIMW) that sets the wage floor by rule wmin,t = Ct/Htarget to cap essentials at 120 hours/month, and an Essential Hours Tax Credit (EHTC) that refunds gaps below 100 hours/month for low-wage cohorts via monthly advances. Using CPI components and CPS/OEWS wages across six metros, we show how TIMW stabilizes MSH near target while EHTC backstops D1–D3 renters during shocks, delivering a dual-key hours guarantee without price controls.

Secondary aims were to examine content overlaps between scales developed specifically for older persons (age-specific) and age-generic scales psychometrically evaluated in older populations, as well as between positively and negatively worded items and between scales targeting well-being and QoL.\nMethods: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, PsycInfo, and CINAHL. Items from included scales were categorised using a framework for well-being and QoL scales. Descriptive statistics illustrate the content distribution, and Jaccard index estimates content overlap.\nResults: A total of 744 items from 35 scales were included. Among the age-specific scales for older persons (n =19), the most common dimensions were personal circumstances, personal relationships, and physical health. For age-generic scales (n =16), activities and functioning, personal relationships, and self-acceptance were most prominent. Average content overlap was 0.42 (range 0.22–0.55) for age-specific scales, indicating moderate overlap.\nConclusion: While there is some consistency in content across age-specific well-being and QoL scales for older persons, notable heterogeneity remains. In addition, this study sheds light on the operational similarities and distinctions between scales aimed at generic and older populations.",

          "authors": "Nanna-Katrine Gram Lange",
          "abstract": "Despite decades of policy efforts, the gender gap in entrepreneurship remains persistent across national contexts. Recent research suggests that these disparities begin early in life, many years before labour market entries. Drawing on qualitative interviews with 23 Danish adolescents aged 13–15, this paper explores how gendered self-concepts and possible selves contribute to the shaping of young people’s perceptions of entrepreneurship. Using a sociological framework that combines theories of doing gender, self-concept, and future orientation, the study finds that girls’ disinterest in entrepreneurship is not rooted in lack of ambition or ability, but in identity misalignment. While girls tend to articulate detailed and socially validated futures, often linked to professions related to care, entrepreneurship appears incompatible with these roles unless it is shown to reinforce who they already want to become. In contrast, boys are more likely to describe vague or flexible future selves, leaving room for entrepreneurship to emerge as a possible option. The findings challenge deficit-based understandings of early gender gaps in entrepreneurship and point to entrepreneurship as one among several possible selves. Ultimately, entrepreneurship becomes meaningful only where it coheres with young people’s evolving sense of who they are and might become.",

          "abstract": "The precise definition of digital literacy has long been contested. Although early definitions recognised the importance of traditional literacy (the ability to read and write) for engaging in digital practices (Gilster, 1997), this connection is often overlooked in recent scholarship, policy initiatives, and digital literacy frameworks. This article draws on ethnographic data from two secondary schools in England to present a case that highlights the relationship between traditional and digital literacies, underscoring the importance of acknowledging and better understanding their interplay. Situated within a socio-technical approach and complemented by Rosenblatt’s transactional theory of reading (1978, 1986, 1995) to conceptualise technology-as-text and user-as-reader, the article presents analysis of three classroom vignettes to illustrate how students’ interactions with an “adaptive” EdTech platform intended to support literacy learning are shaped by their traditional literacy skills. Our analysis identifies a series of transactional breakdowns between reader and text, each marking a moment in which no meaningful transaction can occur due to insufficient consideration of how traditional and digital literacies intersect. Framing EdTech as a straightforward solution to literacy challenges without attending to the nuanced and context-specific ways students engage with such technologies ultimately risks reinforcing the very disparities they seek to address.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, Europe has experienced an increasing number of devastating floods. In 2023 alone, 26 flood events were reported in the first nine months of the year. Two of such events were the floods that hit the Italian regions of Emilia Romagna in May 2023 and Tuscany in November 2023. Using an original survey instrument on a representative sample of the Italian population of residents in Emilia Romagna and Tuscany, we investigate individuals’ climate adaptation and mitigation responses, including their preparedness against extreme climatic events and the determinants of such preparedness, their perception of flood risk likelihood across key life domains, their support for green policies, and their intention to adopt mitigation measures. We further examine whether targeted risk communication can enhance these climate adaptation and mitigation responses through two pre-registered randomized experiments testing the causal impact of flood risk information on the same set of outcomes. Our findings reveal that respondents were highly unprepared, with around 70% per cent of the sample having never taken any action to equip their home to handle extreme climatic events. The experimental results demonstrate that the provision of information on floods’ risk through an effective video message significantly improves individuals’ pro-environmental behavior, their perception of the danger of floods, and their intention to vote for a political coalition that will prioritize on combating climate change. Providing information on flood risk can thus contribute to promoting the vast support for the necessary actions to address the climate crisis.",

Yet urban discovery remains poorly understood and existing research is fragmented. To address this gap, we adapt Leiper’s tourist attraction systems framework to study urban discovery. Our grounded theory analysis on 126 interviews resulted in five distinct discovery modes: instrumental-rational, go-with-the-flow, social, flaneur, and habitual. Besides richly describing these modes, we identify personal, social, contextual, demographic, and affective factors influencing them. We illustrate how playful discovery modes—go-with-the-flow, social, and flaneur—are compatible, leading to mixed discovery modes, while the remaining modes are incompatible. These findings challenge the dominance of rational choice models by revealing a broader spectrum of discovery behaviors. They also provide a foundation for designing a more inclusive urban attraction content space and offer strategic implications for urban attraction management.",

          "abstract": "In this chapter Hildebrandt investigates the link between the contestability that is key to constitutional democracies on the one hand and the falsifiability of scientific theories on the other hand, with regard to large language models (LLMs). Legally relevant decision-making that is based on the deployment of applications that involve LLMs must be contestable in a court of law. The current flavour of such contestability is focused on transparency, usually framed in terms of the explainability of the model (explainable AI). In the long run, however, the fairness and reliability of these models should be tested in a more scientific manner, based on the falsifiability of the theoretical framework that should underpin the model. This requires that researchers in the domain of LLMs learn to abduct theoretical frameworks, based on the output models of LLMs and the real world patterns they imply, while this abduction should be such that the theory can be inductively tested in a way that allows for falsification. On top of that, researchers need to conduct empirical research to enable such inductive testing. The chapter thus argues that the contestability required under the Rule of Law, should move beyond explanations of how the model generates its output, to whether the real world patterns represented in the model output can falsify the theoretical framework that should inform the model.",

This study represents ways and means to develop culturally responsive foot health research as judged by First Nations Peoples which will translate into improved and more responsive ways of delivering foot care. \nMethods: Non-Indigenous and First Nations Peoples sought authentic First Nations-led co-design process in foot health research methods, a governing First Nations Advisory Group, and broader First Nations governance and ethics approvals. Indigenous methodology, data sovereignty, and redistribution of power were imperative in ways of working. First Nations-led co-design developed culturally responsive semi-structured interviews to collect data. Talking with ten registered health practitioners who work closely with lower limb and foot health represented the right mix of participants and enough data to convey a more complicated mosaic of multi-faceted stories. First Nations expertise informed analytic induction and the use of inductive reasoning and constant comparison to identify common and overarching themes, and to perform thematic analysis.\nResults: Authentic First Nations-led ways of working in cross-sectional qualitative study design are documented. Results of data analysis following these ways of working will be published subsequently.\nConclusion: This work provides insights into working right ways in research which will underpin good foot health services with and for First Nations Peoples. The paper highlights ways of working that empowers First Nations Peoples in authentic co-design. First Nations-led foot health research changes ways of working to counter inequities in foot health caused and maintained by ongoing colonisation and systemic racism. This study provides qualified voiced lived experience which foot health researchers must listen to and receive learning and direction from.",

          "abstract": "Despite growing public acceptance of LGB rights, transgender rights have become a focal point of partisan polarization in the US, raising questions about their relative electoral impact. This paper examines the rising electoral salience of anti-transgender attitudes in the 2024 US presidential election, positing that they have surpassed anti-LGB attitudes as a predictor of Republican vote choice. Drawing on data from the 2024 ANES, I test whether affective orientations toward transgender individuals and opposition to transgender-inclusive policies more strongly predict support for Trump in the 2024 US presidential election compared to attitudes toward LGB individuals. Overall, I find that negative estimations of transgender individuals and opposition to pro-transgender policies are significantly associated with vote choice for Trump, outpacing analogous anti-LGB measures. This shift reflects a realignment in social conservative priorities. My findings highlight that issues surrounding gender identity are emerging as a new cultural cleavage, reshaping identity politics and partisan polarization in US elections, with implications for understanding evolving voter behavior and cultural backlash.",

          "authors": "Matthew Yeaton; Paul Green; Grace Cormier; Lara Yang; Sameer Srivastava",
          "abstract": "Social belonging is a fundamental human need, which people experience to varying degrees in the workplace. Interventions to boost belonging have typically focused on changing individuals’ mindsets. We instead develop a structural intervention that seeks to foster belonging by exposing people to unfamiliar colleagues—ones they are not in regular contact with. We consider two forms of such exposure: convergent, to colleagues from the same network community as the focal actor; and divergent, to colleagues from different network communities. Participants in a non-profit organization (N=213) engaged in a facilitated professional development program with unfamiliar colleagues and were randomly assigned to either convergent or divergent groups. Consistent with pre-registered expectations, convergent-condition participants reported more group solidarity and—three months post-intervention—more persistent ties to fellow group members and greater social belonging. Using computational linguistics and machine learning techniques to impute survey responses, we further show that convergent-condition participants experienced greater belonging than did a synthetic control group. Yet, pointing to the tradeoffs of the two forms of exposure, divergent-exposure participants experienced steeper declines in network constraint and greater increases in betweenness and closeness centrality, independent of fellow-group-member ties. We discuss implications for research on social networks, workplace belonging, and organizational interventions.",

          "authors": "Daria Markava",
          "abstract": "While Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools keep gaining popularity among users from around the globe, their vast majority is developed in the west, mainly the US. Although plenty of studies have shown that NLP tools don't perform equally well in different languages and cultural contexts, little research has been conducted on the broader consequences of such performance disparities. By using the evidence from previous research, this study aims to bridge this gap and explore how NLP and the existing cultural hierarchies can be mutually constitutive. This paper first reviews existing literature on the NLP tools' performance in relation to underrepresented languages and non-western cultures. It then takes a critical theory approach to examining the broader cultural implications of the shortcomings identified during the review. More specifically, this work uses the concept of technoculture proposed by Leila Green, to connect the technological and cultural aspects of NLP, and refers to Gramsci's theory of cultural hegemony to explore how the bias in NLP tools reinforces dominant cultural narratives overrepresented in the training data. This study argues that NLP applications play a role in reinforcing the dominant norms, ideals, and ways of expression as universal, thus marginalizing alternative worldviews and imposing normative standards of communication onto the users of different backgrounds. The analysis concludes that, as the popularity of NLP tools keeps growing worldwide, their influence on what is perceived as \"common sense\" will increase too. This study emphasizes the importance of ensuring equitable representation of the user base throughout the whole NLP development pipeline.",

          "authors": "RICARDO ALONZO FERNANDEZ SALGUERO",
          "abstract": "La crisis financiera global de 2008 marcó el inicio de una década dominada por políticas de austeridad fiscal en gran parte del mundo desarrollado. Este documento presenta una revisión narrativa cualitativa de una extensa colección de literatura académica para sintetizar la evidencia sobre los efectos multifacéticos de la austeridad. Siguiendo un enfoque temático inspirado en las directrices PRISMA, se examinan las consecuencias económicas, sociales y políticas de estas medidas. El análisis revela un consenso mayoritario sobre los efectos recesivos de la austeridad, especialmente cuando se implementa durante crisis económicas, con multiplicadores fiscales negativos que a menudo exacerban la contracción del PIB. Socialmente, la austeridad se asocia con un aumento de la desigualdad, impactos negativos en la salud pública, consecuencias de género desproporcionadas y un debilitamiento de las redes de seguridad social. Políticamente, la evidencia vincula la austeridad con la erosión de la confianza en las instituciones, un aumento del populismo y la inestabilidad electoral. A pesar de la narrativa política que presenta la austeridad como una necesidad inevitable para la sostenibilidad fiscal, la literatura académica subraya sus altos costos y su cuestionable eficacia, abogando por enfoques de política económica más contextualizados y equitativos.",

          "authors": "Federica Bologna; Ian Lundberg; Matthew Wilkens",
          "abstract": "Stakeholders in the publishing industry observe strong gender homophily between authors and readers, but it is unclear what causes this alignment. One possible mechanism involves reader preferences for gendered characters – specifically, the largely untested hypothesis that men are less inclined to read books with women protagonists, while women are more willing to read stories featuring protagonists of any gender. This mechanism may affect not only the publication but also the promotion and adaptation of books with women characters. However, there is little causal evidence about the underlying claim: for a given book, would men be more likely to read it if it featured a man character? Would women be more likely to read it if it featured a woman character? Our study provides new causal evidence on these questions in a well-powered study. Using a randomized survey experiment involving 3,000 participants, we isolate the causal effect of protagonist gender on reader preferences. Our findings reveal that the effect of character gender is close to zero. Contrary to popular belief, men’s reading preferences were unaffected by the gender of the protagonist. Women, on the other hand, displayed a slight preference for stories featuring women protagonists. These results challenge a subset of industry assumptions and reassure publishers and authors that books about women characters will not necessarily alienate readers.",

          "authors": "Gannon Bennhoff Gallo",
          "abstract": "Recent advancements in GLSL-based compute shaders that perform parallelized particle simulations and spectral mapping have contributed to the rise of audio-visualizers for mainstream use. This is primarily due to their non-code programming customizability and multimodal input accessibility. Stem-separation features possible in softwares such as Touchdesigner, Ableton Live, Max/MSP, and more pose the question of whether these audio-visualizers could bridge the physiological gap for DHH individuals in sonic environments. Using three different tests: lyric detection, post-listening visual correspondence, and heart rate synchronization, this study empirically serves to find practical evidence, when combined with biological, neurological, and cognitive research in music, on the extent to which audio-visualizers bridge this gap. It was determined through these three tests that yes, participants engaged with the dynamic variety of songs at an increased rate when provided access to the Touchdesigner particle displacement audio-visualizer, attributing perceptual and attentional changes to the multiple distinguishable aspects within the visualizer. I dive into how these findings might be applicable to various music environments that want to increase engagement to DHH individuals, or how these individuals might go about listening to music themselves.",

          "authors": "Christopher Sylvain",
          "abstract": "Human collectives flourish when minds coordinate around shared expectations—what this paper terms coherence. Contemporary neuroscience demonstrates that coherence arises through three nested mechanisms:\n(1) the ACC–PFC loop achieves error closure, resolving internal conflict and prediction mismatch;\n(2) linguistic entrainment synchronizes cortical oscillations between speakers and listeners, producing shared rhythm; and\n(3) inter-brain synchrony appears during cooperative behavior, reflecting cross-person prediction.\nIntegrating hyperscanning, conflict-monitoring, and language-oscillation studies reveals that vigilance cues—threat, guilt, ambiguity—maintain amygdala and ACC activation, whereas resolution cues—trust, forgiveness, prosodic rhythm—recruit vmPFC regulation, promoting oxytocin release and cross-brain coupling. Coherence therefore represents an energy-efficient predictive-coding solution that minimizes uncertainty across agents. We outline measurable biomarkers and ethical applications for public health, digital design, and education, arguing that forgiveness and rhythmic reciprocity constitute biological prerequisites for sustainable social order.",

          "authors": "Kumari Neha Priya",
          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic forced an abrupt transition to remote learning in K-12 education, exposing wide disparities in districts’ ability to sustain instruction. Much of the existing research highlights household-level inequities such as broadband access and parental support, but less is known about the institutional capacity of districts themselves. This study examines whether pre-pandemic administrative capacity, including digital infrastructure, budget transparency, and organizational planning, shaped districts’ ability to adapt during the crisis. Using publicly available panel data from 2018 to 2022 and a difference-in-differences (DiD) regression design, this study tests whether districts with stronger pre-2020 capacity achieved higher levels of remote learning success, measured through engagement, instructional weeks, and related outcomes. Results show that districts with higher administrative capacity prior to the pandemic delivered more resilient instruction and mitigated participation losses, particularly in lower-income contexts. These findings suggest that building institutional capacity before a crisis can reduce educational inequality and strengthen preparedness for future disruptions.",

          "abstract": "Growing concern over the scale of unregulated wildlife trade has led to calls for fundamental changes to systems of species protection. A proposed “reverse listing” approach would ban the harvest and trade of all wild species, except those for which trade can be demonstrated to be sustainable. We evaluate the feasibility of this approach on an international scale and discuss policy solutions. Adopting reverse listing would not be straightforward; key issues include the social legitimacy of resulting laws, ensuring effective law enforcement, and the treatment of trade from alternative (i.e., non-wild) sources. Reverse listing is not a panacea for protecting biodiversity from overexploitation, and a combination of approaches is needed to effectively regulate the world’s wildlife trade.",

          "authors": "Irshad Abdulla",
          "abstract": "Uncertainty in project deliverables remains a pervasive source of IT project failure, yet its structural origins are rarely operationalized. Sambamurthy and Zmud (2017) proposed a conceptual model linking IT project uncertainty to two fundamental dimensions: (1) the clarity or ambiguity of project deliverable specifications and (2) the number, diversity, and power of stakeholders involved. Despite its strong resonance with practice, this framework has not been empirically developed or tested.\nThis paper extends and operationalizes the Sambamurthy–Zmud model by defining measurable constructs for project deliverable specification clarity and stakeholder structure complexity and by theorizing their joint effect on IT project risk. Drawing on information processing theory, stakeholder theory, and socio-technical systems perspectives, the paper argues that IT project uncertainty is not merely a descriptive condition, but a primary driver of project risk. A conceptual model and testable hypotheses are proposed to guide future empirical research and managerial practice in digital transformation projects.",
