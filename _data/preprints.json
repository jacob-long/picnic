          "abstract": "Publications reporting research conducted on human participants, such as clinical trials,\ncommonly include a table summarising the relevant characteristics of the study participants.\nThese tables are crucial to compare studies, assess generalisabillity and identify understudied\npopulations. In metaresearch and evidence syntheses, where the sample is instead comprised\nof research papers, tables describing features such as the proportion of open access papers,\npublication language, or authors’ gender are uncommon. Collating these additional\ncharacteristics manually would require substantial time and resources. Without this\ninformation, however, our understanding of the generalisability of study findings is limited.\nFurthermore, researchers cannot compare sample characteristics across studies or assess the\nimpact of different sampling methods. This project aims to: 1) propose a standard sample\ncharacteristics table structure for studies performed on research papers, 2) determine which of\nthese characteristics can be assessed by automated tools, and 3) create a web application that\nallows researchers to quickly generate a sample characteristics table using existing automated\ntools. We will share progress by updating this preprint as we complete these goals, allowing\nothers to provide feedback and contribute. We hope that this project will mainstream sample\ncharacteristics reporting for studies on research papers, stimulate automated tool development\nto fill gaps, and facilitate studies on sample characteristics and generalisability in metaresearch.",

          "authors": "María de los Ángeles Crespo López; Claudia Pallise Perello; Jeroen de Ridder; Krishma Labib",
          "abstract": "The open science (OS) movement is growing, with increasing policies, guidelines, tools and infrastructures being developed to support researchers who engage in OS practices. However, there is no widely accepted single definition of OS. Different initiatives and countries employ a variety of characterizations. To chart how OS is understood in different parts of the world, we conducted a scoping review and critical discourse analysis of OS guidance documents aimed at researchers. Our search led to the inclusion of 69 national and international documents, with most originating from North America, Europe, and Latin America. Our results show that OS discourses are exaggerated, framing OS as the solution to address all scientific and societal problems. Furthermore, they provide often conflicting ideas about what OS can achieve. Many guidance documents frame OS as a tool to promote economic growth and efficiency. Others see OS as necessary to safeguard research quality and reproducibility through transparency. In contrast, few documents address knowledge equity and inclusion. Taking this into account, we see dominant OS discourses reproducing knowledge equity problems already present in research, rather than tackling them. We urge researchers be more precise about the specific approach they take to OS and more humble about the effects it can have – both positive, and negative.",

          "abstract": "Fiction books on aspects of research integrity can be a valuable supplement to normative guidelines on how research should be done. They provide concrete examples of violations of codes of conduct. Their narratives sketch fictional cases of research misconduct and questionable research practices, and the circumstances under which they can occur. Novels can realistically depict the dilemmas scholars need to navigate in an accessible way that readers can relate to both intellectually and emotionally. This may help them to reflect on what a good researcher is and what academic scholars can do to stay close to that ideal. A sample of 31 novels from the last 100 years is described with special attention to the research integrity themes and the drivers of the depicted problems the books contain. These novels may be used in research integrity training as a method to evoke individual reflection or to inspire group discussion.",

          "authors": "Jesica Formoso; Laura Acion; Nicolas Palopoli; Juan Pablo Barreyro",
          "abstract": "Access to international funding is essential for sustaining research, yet researchers in Latin America face persistent inequities that constrain their competitiveness. This study aimed to identify perceived barriers and strategies to improve equitable access to international research funding. We employed a sequential mixed-methods design. In the qualitative phase, a virtual focus group with five researchers from Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and Guatemala explored experiences with international grant applications. Thematic analysis revealed three overarching themes: (1) strategies and good practices; (2) barriers and structural constraints; and (3) recommendations for equity. Barriers included language and cultural differences, perceived bias from Global North funders, unrealistic infrastructural expectations, and limited opportunities for networking. These insights informed the design of a quantitative survey, which was completed by 253 researchers from 16 countries; 60.4% had applied to international calls and 43.6% reported receiving at least one grant. Across 668 reported applications, success rate was 40.6%. The most frequently endorsed barriers were economic costs of networking (92.3%), misalignment between eligibility criteria and local trajectories (80.8%), rhetorical differences in grant writing (75.3%), and self-perceptions of lower competitiveness (69.2%). Results highlight persistent structural, linguistic, and cultural barriers limiting equitable access. Suggested actions include context-sensitive training in grant writing, mentorship schemes, and the design of funding calls that explicitly account for the realities of low- and middle-income countries.",

This chapter provides a practical guide for integrating preregistration into teaching and supervision.\n\nThe first section highlights arguments for adopting preregistration, emphasising its role in reducing biases. It introduces preregistration as a critical skill for academic development and offers guidance for designing learning exercises, including activities that build competencies in hypothesis formulation, study design, and analysis planning relevant to both quantitative and qualitative studies.\nThe second section addresses the practical implementation of preregistration in student-led projects. It discusses how to support preregistration across methodological traditions—quantitative, qualitative, and systematic reviews—and offers concrete guidance on template selection, platform use, managing deviations from preregistered plans, and reporting exploratory analyses.",

          "authors": "Michael Thomas Warren; Meg Aum Warren; Ryan Niemiec; Camille A Fogel; Louise Lambert",
          "abstract": "Men’s engagement in allyship carries the potential to improve gender equity and workplace inclusion. A common prototype of allyship is bravely calling out the bias of perpetrators. Yet, conceptualized so narrowly, men’s allyship toward women could be ill-fitting for men with heart-based character strengths such as kindness and social intelligence. Using pre-registered person- and variable-centered analyses, we examined how well 10 allyship strategies were perceived as personally good-fitting in an international sample (N = 3,863; from 103 countries) of employed men with high gender equity values. ‘Giving credit/deference to women’ and ‘cheerleading for women’s career advancement’ (relationship-building strategies) were rated best-fitting, whereas ‘calling out’ (a committed allyship strategy) was by far the worst-fitting. Person-centered analyses revealed that men in our “high potential” profile (high in bravery, fairness, kindness, perspective, and social intelligence) rated both relationship-building and committed strategies as better-fitting than did other men. Exploratory variable-centered analyses indicated that kindness and social intelligence, strengths of the heart, were associated with more allyship strategies than any of the other 22 strengths we tested. This study challenges prevailing myths of what character strengths position men to address gender bias in the workplace.",

          "authors": "Herald Cela; Guilherme Wood",
          "abstract": "This study examines how emotional tone and mental-health discourse influence participation in Reddit communities focused on dating apps. We analyzed more than 378,000 posts, collected between July 2022 and June 2025, from five major subreddits dedicated to dating apps, including r/Tinder, r/Bumble, r/hingeapp, r/OkCupid, and r/onlinedating. Posts were processed with transformer-based sentiment analysis and through a BERT-based classifier (PsychBERT) that allocated content into mental health categories such as anxiety, depression, social anxiety, loneliness, and mental illness. Three key patterns emerge. First, the overall tone of discussion is persistently negative and becomes increasingly so over time, suggesting a gradual deterioration in the emotional climate of these communities. Second, mental-health framing is widespread but uneven: social anxiety is especially prevalent, while explicit references to depression or mental illness appear less frequently and decline relative to neutral content. Third, community responses show a selective amplification of vulnerable disclosures. Posts that explicitly reference loneliness, depression, or anxiety receive markedly higher community support, and emotional intensity itself predicts greater visibility through Reddit’s scoring system. These findings demonstrate how dating-related online forums do more than host individual narratives: they actively shape the collective emotional environment by rewarding certain kinds of disclosures. The results highlight an interplay between platform design, community norms, and patterns of self-expression that can validate distress but also reinforce negative affect at scale.",

          "authors": "Simon Weber; Sarah Anne Kemp; Mark R. Hinder",
          "abstract": "Action cancellation represents a fundamental aspect of human motor control, though the behavioural paradigms used to assess it are methodologically diverse, and capture an incompletely understood combination of processes. Advancing theoretical accounts of action cancellation have motivated increasingly complicated experimental designs, leading some authors to draw comparisons between “simple” and “complex” stopping tasks. The latter describes a mix of paradigms which variably require increased working memory demands, stimulus discrimination, distractor interference, or more complex stimulus-response mappings. This narrative review provides an accessible explanation of commonly implemented complex stopping tasks, selected based on their relevance to current theoretical debates. Throughout, we describe the challenges associated with interpreting performance in these tasks, and highlight future directions for research. Notably, much of the past work using these tasks has applied traditional methods of indexing the speed of stopping, which were developed specifically for simple stopping tasks, and do not generalise well beyond this context. Recent research using cognitive modelling and physiological approaches has failed to replicate earlier findings, raising fundamental questions regarding how action cancellation should be indexed. Furthermore, physiological observations in complex stopping tasks appear to be incompatible with current accounts of the neurological mechanisms that underpin action cancellation. We propose potential ways forward, highlighting how the current lack of well-controlled comparisons between task types means the literature risks extensive task-specific findings that fail to generalise between laboratories, and – critically – beyond the laboratory.",

          "authors": "Yi Zhang; Leor M Hackel",
          "abstract": "Social environments present opportunities for connection and resources, but they also involve the risk of rejection. How do people learn which individuals will reject or accept them upon entering a novel environment? Here, we propose a route to such learning: people use knowledge of relationships in social networks to infer who will be likely to accept or reject them. Previous research shows that people generalize trust from one individual to that individual’s friends, yet it remains unclear whether rejection and acceptance experiences generalize in similar ways in social network contexts. We designed a novel experimental paradigm in which participants experienced rejection and acceptance within an artificial group, learned about network connections among group members, and decided which members to approach in a new task. Study 1 found that participants generalized rejection by avoiding individuals socially closer to a rejector and approaching those closer to an accepter, forming a gradient of avoidance and approach based on network distance. Study 2 further demonstrated stronger generalization when networks reflected friendship as opposed to randomly assigned ties, suggesting partner choices depend on explicit inferences about meaningful relationships rather than associative learning alone. Finally, in a longitudinal survey of student groups, Study 3 extended these findings to real-world social networks, revealing similar patterns of generalization in college student organizations. Together, our findings inform the cognitive processes that help humans successfully navigate social environments by adaptively forming new connections.",

          "authors": "Hongyang Liu",
          "abstract": "Dual-process theories posit that fast, intuitive System 1 often produces bias, whereas slow, deliberative System 2 corrects it. This manuscript challenges that traditional view by synthesizing theory and evidence on motivated System-2 reasoning (MS2R)—the tendency for deliberation to be co-opted in defense of identity-relevant beliefs. Across domains (e.g., climate risk, vaccines, gun policy), polarization has been shown to increase with subject-matter knowledge or numeracy when issues implicate social identity, whereas the same abilities improve accuracy for identity-neutral problems. Six complementary mechanisms are reviewed to explain these effects: (a) confirmation bias and motivated skepticism; (b) identity-protective cognition; (c) belief as value-signaling (expressive utility); (d) cognitive dissonance and conflict rationalization; (e) the argumentative theory of reasoning; and (f) bounded/resource-rational approaches (e.g., BIASR) that yield selective trust as an efficient but polarizing heuristic. Boundary conditions and critiques are then considered. High-powered replications indicate a robust directional motivated-reasoning main effect but limited evidence that higher ability amplifies bias uniformly; design features (ambiguity, incentives, audience visibility) and affect-first gating appear pivotal. Identity-congruent responding is further reinterpreted as instrumentally rational signaling under reputational and career incentives, especially for elites. Finally, actionable countermeasures are proposed: accuracy prompts and incentives, self-affirmation and identity-safe framing, symmetric-scrutiny protocols (e.g., steel-manning), probabilistic forecasting with feedback, clarity-enhancing data displays and preregistered criteria, and prebunking. Research prospects include sharper operationalization separating ability, disposition, and state engagement; process-tracing and psychophysiological markers to adjudicate mechanisms; and preregistered, multi-lab designs that vary ambiguity, incentives, and audience. Educational applications emphasize embedding accuracy nudges, forecasting tournaments, and structured adversarial collaboration to realign System 2 from identity performance toward error detection.",

          "abstract": "Hypothetical scenarios provide an extremely useful alternative to field experiments for scholars interested in nudging behavior change, comprising a substantial proportion of the literature. Yet the extent to which hypotheticals accurately estimate real-world treatment effects is not well understood. To investigate, we identified five recent field studies of real-world nudges in distinct domains and designed four styles of hypothetical scenarios to approximate each one. This setup allows for clear comparison of old field data with new hypothetical data. Across our 20 experiments (N=16,114), hypothetical scenarios nearly always estimated the correct direction of treatment effects. However, they varied widely in estimating magnitudes, making them unreliable inputs to real-world policy applications such as cost-benefit analyses. Our findings underscore the promising value of hypotheticals, but also the need for greater investigation into strategies to calibrate their estimates.",

          "authors": "Devyn Riddle; Alexia Miller; Vittoria Trolio; Ege Bicaker; Sarah Elizabeth Racine",
          "abstract": "Objective: Longitudinal research finds that both dietary restraint and restriction prospectively predict binge eating; however, research on momentary and daily predictive relationships has been mixed. The current study aimed to evaluate a combined restriction-affect regulation model of binge eating that considers whether restriction is more likely to lead to binge eating when affect is not sufficiently regulated by restriction. \nMethod: One hundred and one women with binge-spectrum eating disorders completed a 14-day ecological momentary assessment study. Participants reported current negative affect multiple times daily and dietary restriction and/or binge eating on surveys completed after eating. A multilevel mediation model was used to evaluate whether negative affect mediates the relationship between restriction and binge eating at both within- and between-person levels. \nResults: The direct effect of restriction on binge eating was not significant at either within- or between-person levels. At the within-person level, restriction was not related to subsequent negative affect, but greater negative affect significantly predicted subsequent binge eating. There was a significant indirect effect of restriction on binge eating through negative affect at the between-person, but not the within-person, level.\nDiscussion: Results suggest that momentary restriction is not a clear predictor of later binge eating, regardless of negative affect, while negative affect and binge eating are clearly linked. Future studies should further consider the conditions (e.g., time of day, type of restriction) under which momentary restriction does and does not predict binge eating. Overall, these results underscore the importance of implementing affect-regulation skills in treatment for binge eating.",

A failure to embrace open science practices may lead to concerns about the trustworthiness and reliability of its research outputs. This study explored the current use of open science practices among BA researchers, focusing on the adoption, underlying motivations, concerns, and support needs across seven specific open science practices.\nMethods: We distributed an exploratory survey through professional networks, conferences, and social media and received a final N = 83 (early career researcher (ECRs) N= 41). The survey covered six domains: general use, frequency, importance, engagement, concerns, and support needs related to open science practices.\nResults: Most respondents reported positive attitudes toward open science, with preregistration (75% of total N) and data sharing (65% of total N) as the most commonly used practices. Descriptively, ECRs placed greater importance on these practices than their established counterparts, suggesting a potential generational shift. ECRs primarily reported concerns about insufficient knowledge and fear of errors, while established researchers emphasized workload and a lack of incentives. Both groups highlighted the need for increased time, resources, institutional support, and training.\nDiscussion: Although our findings are descriptive and limited by self-selection and sample bias, they offer initial insights into how open science is perceived and practised in the field. Sustained progress \nrequires coordinated action from individuals, institutions, and professional societies in terms of knowledge transfer and incentives to ensure inclusive and equitable adoption of open science practices.",

Sixteen studies met inclusion criteria. Two random-effects meta-analyses were conducted using correlation as the effect size metric. Study quality, publication bias, and heterogeneity were assessed using PRISMA guidelines. \n\nResults: Ten studies yielded a significant and positive, but small, aggregate effect between cybervictimization and SITBs in SGM samples (r = .23), which remained significant after adjusting for publication bias (r = .18) and sensitivity analyses. The prediction interval (.005 to .435) indicated effects may vary widely in future studies. The meta-analysis of six studies examining interaction effects produced a near-zero effect (r = –.003).  \n\nConclusions: Findings highlight a critical blind spot in SGM youth suicide prevention research, limiting the effectiveness of social media and suicide prevention policy.",

Understanding scalable factors that promote resilience is critical to supporting individuals following adversity. One avenue to resiliency may be through music listening, which involves affective and reward-related processes targeted by early adversity. Little is known about how early adversity affects musical engagement and its relation to adult resilience. Across two studies (Study 1: n=254; ages 18-65; Study 2: n=288; ages 18-55) we examined effects of exposure to dimensions of early adversity (unpredictability, threat, deprivation) on musical engagement and resiliency in adulthood. Individuals exposed to early unpredictability showed increased emotional absorption into music. Increased absorption mediated associations between early unpredictability and adult resilience. Absorption was associated with escapism, specifically adaptive motivations to seek positive affect, offering a mechanism for music’s adaptive effects. These findings posit musical absorption as an accessible tool for resilience, especially following early life unpredictability.",

          "abstract": "Many different models exist for examining causal effects in panel data through cross-lagged associations. Choosing among these models depends in part on assumptions about patterns of stability in the variables being examined. In this paper, we first use simulations to examine how different data-generating models affect bias in commonly used models that include cross-lagged effects. We then examine patterns of stability in over 400 variables from a 22-year panel study from Australia to assess plausibility of the parameter values from the simulations and to help evaluate risk of bias. Empirical results show that patterns of stability in real data are often inconsistent with expectations from commonly used models that fail to incorporate a state component. Simulation results show that bias in estimates from these commonly used models will likely be high, given these patterns of stability. Alternative models that include state components are recommended to more accurately account for patterns of stability and to reduce bias in estimates of lagged effects.",

          "authors": "Jeffrey M. Girard; Daiil Jun; Desmond Ong; Einat Liebenthal; Justin T. Baker",
          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is increasingly used to analyze emotion in text, but its performance on naturalistic speech remains poorly understood. We evaluated 20 large language models (LLMs), ranging from 1 to 120 billion parameters, on their ability to estimate fine-grained sentiment in transcripts of naturalistic speech. All models were open-weight, meaning their parameters are publicly available and can be run locally without reliance on cloud services. Two datasets were used: the Stanford Emotional Narratives Dataset, autobiographical stories from community participants, and the Bipolar Longitudinal Study, daily audio journals from outpatients with severe mental illness. Human sentiment ratings served as the reference, and models were benchmarked against both individual human agreement and lexicon-based tools (LIWC, VADER). Results showed a three-tier accuracy pattern: small models performed at or below baseline tools, mid-sized models (7-30 billion parameters) matched human agreement, and larger or optimized models exceeded it. Accuracy improved with scaling up to ~12 billion, after which gains plateaued, highlighting diminishing returns beyond mid-sized architectures. Performance was robust to transcription source, indicating AI transcription error did not impair accuracy. Fairness analyses showed overall accuracy was equitable across demographic groups, though modest disparities appeared in prediction consistency by participant race and education. These findings demonstrate that recent open-weight LLMs can match or surpass human-level performance in sentiment analysis of naturalistic speech while running efficiently on affordable workstation hardware. These advances open opportunities for studying emotional dynamics in daily life and developing privacy-preserving tools for clinical research.",

          "abstract": "Empathy plays a crucial role in fostering prosocial behaviour. However, empathic processes\nare influenced by in-group bias, such that individuals tend to empathise more with their in-\ngroup members. This study aims to test if training individuals to look longer at out-group\nfaces can help reduce in-group bias in empathy by improving attention to out-group\nmembers' suffering. Four lab-based experiments (N = 240) assessed the training's impact on\nvisual attention, implicit bias, and empathic selection. Gaze training successfully increased\nattentional focus on out-group members' pain expression and reduced implicit racial bias.\nFurthermore, pupil dilation—a marker of emotional engagement—toward out-group pain\nincreased post-training. No significant changes occurred in explicit or motivational empathic\nchoices. The findings suggest that attentional allocation is a crucial early-stage mechanism in\nempathy that can be modified through gaze-training. However, to achieve broader empathic\noutcomes may require additional interventions targeting motivational components of\nempathy.",

          "authors": "Rebecca J. Linnett; Stephanie J. Hubbard; Noelle Robertson; John Maltby",
          "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 850 million people worldwide, imposing not only substantial health burdens but also complex dietary management challenges. For kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), dietary restrictions often lessen post-transplant, yet the transition to a 'normal' diet is fraught with difficulty after years of externally imposed rules. In this context, intuitive eating, which emphasises internal hunger and satiety cues over external dietary mandates, may support the development of sustainable, self-managed eating behaviours. Despite the recent publication of a third version of the scale, the Intuitive Eating Scale-2 (IES-2) is currently the most widely-used measure of intuitive eating, but it has not yet been validated for use with KTRs. To address this gap, a mixed-methods validation study was conducted, integrating qualitative thinkaloud interviews with KTRs and a quantitative survey involving KTRs and a non-CKD comparison group, to evaluate the face, factorial and construct validity and internal consistency of the IES-2 within this population. Results from both qualitative and quantitative workstreams revealed critical psychometric and conceptual issues with the 'Unconditional Permission to Eat' (UPE) subscale, including compromised item discrimination, construct validity, and reliability, as well as responses being systematically influenced by participants’ experiences as KTRs. The original four-factor structure of the IES-2 was unsupported in both groups. Alternative models were tested, and an 11-item, three-factor structure excluding the UPE subscale demonstrated excellent fit across KTR and comparison samples. Although a third version of this scale now exists, there is no validation data available for people with kidney disease or solid organ transplantation, meaning these findings provide the first validated, contextually appropriate configuration of a scale of intuitive eating for use with KTRs, offering a robust tool to advance research and clinical practice in this population.",

          "abstract": "Determining when a past event occurred often requires inferring connections between related experiences rather than recalling a directly observed event time. While prior studies demonstrate that even children draw on temporal knowledge about familiar routines to infer retrospectively when events likely occurred, we know less about the learning mechanisms that support formation of such temporal knowledge and how those mechanisms develop and underlie gains in temporal inference. Here, 104 participants aged 7–25 years completed a temporal memory task in which participants repeatedly viewed four event sequences (“days”) comprising five unique events. Clock cues were presented between each event within a sequence, with those cues varying across sequence repetition. Thus, to learn the precise times of events, participants needed to encode the clock cue information and update it across sequence repetitions to infer the precise time of an individual event. We found that while order memory for events within a sequence reached adult-like levels in early adolescence, the ability to infer precise event times from the clock cues continued to mature into adulthood. Moreover, when clock cues were more variable and uncertain across repetitions, children and adolescents showed less precise temporal inferences that were biased toward the average times of events that shared a sequence position across the four “days”. Together, these findings indicate that developmental improvements in memory linking, wherein information is updated and combined across multiple episodic experiences, drive age-related gains in the precision with which individuals infer the precise timing of events.",

          "authors": "Rebecca J. Linnett; Noelle Robertson; Stephanie J. Hubbard",
          "abstract": "Intuitive eating is an adaptive eating approach characterised by having unconditional permission to eat when you are hungry, eating for physical rather than emotional reasons, relying on internal hunger and satiety cues, and honouring your health and practising gentle nutrition. The Intuitive Eating Scale-2 (IES-2) is currently the most commonly-used intuitive eating measure but, to date, there has not been a systematic review of how it performs psychometrically outside of the student sample in which it was developed. This systematic review aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the IES-2, including its associations with other variables, across all studies that used it as a measure of intuitive eating and reported psychometric data. MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of Science were searched in April 2022, May 2024 and June 2025, identifying 90 papers from diverse populations including college students, people from the general population/community, and people seeking treatment for eating disorders or weight management. Results were presented and synthesised narratively, and risk of bias was assessed using two domains from the COSMIN Risk of Bias checklist. Findings suggest that the IES-2 has good construct validity but underperforms psychometrically in other areas such as response distribution, subscale inter-correlations and dimensionality, particularly in relation to the ‘Unconditional permission to eat’ subscale. Alternative factor structures were reported on and a three-factor solution excluding the ‘Unconditional permission to eat’ subscale was found to have promising results. The review contributes a comprehensive account of the biopsychosocial correlates of the IES-2, as well as identifying that studies relating to weight or eating disorders often report mean scores that tend towards the extremes of the scale. Limitations include the exclusion of non-English translations of the IES-2, and future reviews would benefit from being conducted in other languages. PROSPERO registration: CRD42022299436.

          "abstract": "Level and variability are two key aspects of momentary self-esteem that are associated with mental health from early adolescence onwards, but little is known about their determinants. The current study examines how the trait-level use of four emotion regulation strategies—reappraisal, reflection, expressive suppression, social sharing—is associated with the level and variability of momentary self-esteem in the developmentally critical period of adolescence. Using mixed-effects location scale models, we analyzed experience sampling data from 408 adolescents (14 to 22 years, 81.62% girls) who reported their momentary self-esteem up to 35 times across one week. Two findings stand out: First, adolescents who tended to engage more in reappraisal, reflection, and social sharing to regulate their emotions experienced higher momentary self-esteem levels, whereas those who tended to engage more in expressive suppression experienced lower levels. Second, the tendency to use expressive suppression was consistently linked to more variability in momentary self-esteem. We discuss the contribution of emotion regulation strategies to levels of momentary self-esteem in adolescence and highlight the need for further research into the mechanisms underlying its variability.",

          "abstract": "Humans are remarkably efficient at learning new tasks, in large part by relying on the integration of previously learned knowledge. However, research on task learning typically focuses on the learning of abstract task rules on minimalist stimuli, to study behavior independent of the learning history that humans come equipped with (i.e., semantic knowledge). In contrast, several theories suggest that the use of semantic knowledge and labels may help the learning of new task information. Here, we tested whether providing existing, semantically rich task rules and response labels allowed for more robust task encoding and less (catastrophic) forgetting and interference. Our results show that providing semantically rich task rules and response labels resulted in less task forgetting (Experiment 1), both when using pictorial symbols or words as labels (Experiment 2). Using artificial recurrent neural networks fitted to task behavior, we show that the semantically rich learning conditions resulted in more separated task representations during learning. Finally, using a subsequent value-based decision-making task and reinforcement learning modeling (Experiment 3), we demonstrate how the learned embedding of novel stimuli in semantically rich, representations, further allowed for a more efficient, feature-specific processing when learning new task information. Together, our findings show the benefit of using semantically rich task rules and response labels during novel task learning, thereby offering important insights into why humans excel in continual learning and are less susceptible to catastrophic forgetting compared to most artificial agents.",

          "abstract": "Individual ratings of people, political parties, and objects are contingent on comparisons with standards raters may not be aware of. In this vein, striking evidence from attitude research suggests that previously answered questions affect responses to subsequent attitude questions such that previous questions provide a frame of reference. It stands to reason, however, that previously responded-to items are less influential in self-report assessments of personality because personality is self-referential and assumed to be more stable and consistent than attitudes. Across four experiments (ntotal = 4,895), we tested whether univariate, bivariate, and multivariate properties of the Big Five Inventory-10 and HEX-ACO-18 personality scales differ as a function of the type of items a person has responded to already (i.e., buffer items, items with the same or opposite keying directions, respectively, or no additional items in a control group). Across groups, little variation occurred in the responses and subscale-specific inter-item correlations, and measurement invariance did not hold across conditions. These findings militate against what we refer to as the item context effect for personality assessment and suggest that researchers need not worry too much about the order in which they administer their target measures. Further steps for advancement and refinement are presented.",

Semi-structured interviews (N = 15) were conducted with fans from three clubs (n = 5 per club) across different English football leagues. Using Reflexive Thematic Analysis, we identified two overarching themes that promote positive fan-club relationships: the importance of communication and club action on fan concerns. The communication theme split into two subthemes: club communication to fans, and opportunities for fans to communicate back to their club. Identity leadership dimensions, specifically identity entrepreneurship and advancement, cut across all themes. We conclude that communication and action are mechanisms through which football clubs can engage in identity leadership and promote positive fan-club relationships.",

German 6- to 9-year-olds were tested on their ability to recognize words in English utterances that overlapped in form with their L1 translation equivalents (e.g. cognate words, milk-Milch /mɪlk/ - /mɪlx/) or did not (e.g. noncognate words, smoke - Rauch, /smoʊk/ - /raʊ̯x/). L1 form similarity neither influenced performance at the group level nor when differences in individual L1 skills were considered. This pattern of results remained even when, in Experiment 2, the L1 word form was pre-activated visually. Unlike adults’, pre-EFL learners’ recognition of words in continuous speech does not seem to be affected by form similarity to the L1, which we link to differences in how form-meaning mappings are relevant in FL learning across development.",

In  an  influential  study, Hajcak and Foti (2008) explored the idea that errors could trigger defensive motivational reactions and  that  the  ERN  might  forecast  the  intensity  of  defensive  reactions  following  errors.  Using  a flanker task, thirty-one college-aged participants responded to the direction of a central arrow with acoustic  startle  probes administered  pseudo-randomly  throughout.  Hajcak  and  Foti’s  (2008) findings indicated the ERN is indicative of individual variations in aversive reactions to errors.

As  part  of  the #EEGManyLabs project, an international network of laboratories, we will test the replicability of the results from this influential study. The data will later be combined to compute global effect sizes of the ERN, startle potentiation, and their interaction. Collectively, these replications will help solidify the results from this highly-cited study. Given that the ERN is an integral part of a broader neural  system  responding  to  potentially  threatening  stimuli,  this  replication  will  provide  a  more solid  foundation  for  our  understanding  of  error  processing  and  its  relationship  to  defensive reactivity.",

What psychometric structure best fits these features (unidimensional, multidimensional, bifactor)?  How is eustress related to distress and wellbeing?  Can individuals be clustered effectively into different eustress profiles?  To address these issues, we developed a novel eustress instrument:  the Comprehensive Hierarchical Eustress Review (CHER), motivated by a new model, the Comprehensive Hierarchical construct of Eustress (CHE).  Analogous to the CHE model, the CHER instrument contains three subscales for CHE’s three sources of eustress (goal-directed action, momentary experience, stable qualities) with 47 items that reflect the 47 features of eustress that CHE extracted from the literature.  To evaluate CHER and explore its potential for understanding eustress, we assessed it in a well-powered adult UK sample (N = 260).  Using confirmatory factor analyses, we found that eustress is best understood as both a unidimensional and a multidimensional construct (i.e., a bifactor model), with items from all three subscales contributing to its conceptual core.  The best performing model exhibited desirable internal qualities (satisfactory reliability and item discrimination) and external qualities (eustress negatively related to distress and positively related to wellbeing).  Using latent profile analysis, we identified four clusters of individuals with different eustress profiles, who differed further on sociodemographic characteristics and personality traits.  Findings reported have theoretical, empirical, and interventional implications for future work on the generation of positive experiences in challenging situations.",

          "abstract": "Organisations are increasingly implementing extended reality (XR) in education, organisational training, and sports practice. However, the effectiveness of XR compared to conventional training methods, and the potential improvements that additional sensory information, such as haptic feedback, may offer are unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis compared XR with non-XR training programmes in improving psychomotor skill performance and assessed whether haptic feedback improved programmes’ effectiveness. Eight databases were searched on June 30th, 2025, for randomised controlled trials quantitatively measuring the effectiveness of a psychomotor skill after an XR-based training programme. Sensitivity analyses, publication bias and risk of bias were assessed. Due to non-independence of effect sizes, robust variance meta-regression models were run and presented using forest plots. Seventy-eight reports were assessed, totalling 3546 participants. Both the post-training and pre-post-training change scores between XR and non-XR groups were assessed. Two RVEMR models were created by splitting the control groups into two types: passive (no training) and active (non-XR training). All models found statistically significant positive effects of XR training over non-XR training on task performance. No variables were found to be consistently associated with task performance, although haptic feedback showed a consistent, non-significant negative effect on task performance. Evidence certainty was limited by high heterogeneity, low-moderate risk of bias, and poor methods reporting. Overall, XR-based training generally appears to be beneficial for training psychomotor skills over and above conventional training. Further research into the role of haptic feedback and other potential predictive variables in performance outcomes is warranted. Researchers are also advised to improve methodological reporting to aid future evidence syntheses in this research area.",

Participants memorized and executed sequences of spoken instructions under a baseline and three experimental conditions: additional free time, active verbal repetition, and passive repetition. In young adults, free time substantially improved performance. Passive repetition also improved performance, but not beyond the effect of free time. Active repetition, on the other hand, slightly impaired it. In 9-year-olds, active repetition also impaired performance, but free time provided little benefit. These findings demonstrate that providing more free time during instruction delivery improves performance in young adults but is far less effective in children, suggesting important developmental differences in the short-term maintenance of instructions and the (strategic) use of free time.",

While these theories have been instrumental in shaping the field, they have also faced criticism. Although it might appear that the limitations of both theories could be resolved through adjustments and further research, we adopt a meta-theoretical perspective to assess ART and SRT against general standards of theory construction. We argue that neither framework meets core standards for predictive utility or explanatory power. We focus on two issues. On the one hand, critical constructs assumed to predict restorative nature experiences are often vague, circular (e.g., “soft fascination”) or underdetermined in terms of their level of specificity. On the other hand, both theories exhibit explanatory fragility: ART’s resource-based account of restoration does not clarify how depletion and replenishment actually occur, whereas SRT’s evolutionary explanation posits what appears to be an unnecessary and unfalsifiable adaptive mechanism. We conclude by challenging the assumption that the psychologically beneficial effects of nature are in some way “special” and instead advocate for greater epistemic restraint in building nature-specific theories around beneficial nature effects.",

          "abstract": "The present work sought to develop a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between features of extended reality (XR) training interventions and successful training outcomes using a Bayesian Network (BN) model. We extracted data from 41 previous independent-group XR training studies, focusing on technology features (e.g., body visualization, visual fidelity, haptic feedback, personalization) and training design elements (e.g., continuous challenge, explicit feedback, training duration). We sought to elucidate the causal relationships between these variables to predict training success (both learning of the training task and transfer to new tasks) in sensorimotor tasks. The structure of our BN model was informed by expert knowledge, prior literature, and causal reasoning. The joint probability distribution over the model was then learned from the data extracted from previous studies. The model's performance was examined using cross-fold validation, yielding high precision (82.5%) and accuracy (77%). Performing probabilistic inference on the final model revealed nuanced insights into the effects of individual and combined features on training outcomes. Notably, haptic feedback, particularly when combined with body visualization, provided little benefit for learning of the training task, but did improve transfer of training. Meanwhile, continuous challenge emerged as the most influential training design feature for increasing the probability of transfer. Overall, the technology and training design features that were beneficial for transfer were often not beneficial for task learning, highlighting a critical distinction between short-term performance gains and the long-term retention and adaptability of skills across different contexts. These findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of how specific technology and training design features influence XR training success, paving the way for new theoretically-grounded applications of immersive technology.",

          "authors": "Angad Sahni; Ciara McCabe",
          "abstract": "Background: Depressed individuals are less reactive than controls to positive stimuli in the laboratory, yet mood brightening (MB) is when positive stimuli increase positive affect (PA) and/or decreases negative affect (NA) more in those with depression compared to controls, in real life.  Leisure activities and social company may drive mood brightening in depression, but their impact on anhedonia remains unclear, clarifying this could inform intervention development.\nMethods: Participants (N=71, mean 20yrs) with a range of depression and anhedonia symptoms provided 6 days Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data about their leisure activities and social company and NA and PA. In 2,177 ecological momentary assessments, we measured affective reactivity as the difference between PA and NA at the time of the activity/social company compared to two baselines: previous assessment (t-1, temporal instability) and within-subject mean. Longitudinal multilevel linear regression models examined the interaction between symptoms and affect reactivity to leisure and to social company.\nResults: Multilevel models revealed that those with higher depression (p&lt;0.05) and anhedonia symptoms (p&lt;0.025) had greater reductions in NA during leisure activity and that those with higher depression symptoms (p&lt;0.05) had greater reductions in NA during social company. These findings indicate MB effects of leisure activity and social company.\nConclusions: Although MB has been documented in depression this is the first study to examine a MB effect in anhedonia symptoms. We provide real-time evidence that encouraging individuals with depression and anhedonia symptoms to engage in leisure activities and seek out enjoyable social company could elevate their mood via a reduction in NA.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges for humanity in this century. Communicating in a way that raises awareness of the risk climate changes poses while at the same time not inducing negative feelings, like helplessness, is a challenge. Emphasizing the severity of climate change is related to higher risk perception, which could lead to more pro-environmental behavior. That, however, could trigger higher helplessness which is associated with lower motivation to act climate friendly. In our research we investigated the impact of induced controllability of the consequences of climate change on risk perception and learned helplessness. We conducted two experiments with N = 216 (gender-balanced) and N = 483 (quota-based sample) participants in Germany. Participants received six climate change scenarios that differed only in induced controllability (high vs low). There were four conditions: own control, control by government, hopeless, and a control condition. For both experiments results showed that participants’ risk perception increased after they read the scenarios, independent of the conditions. In Experiment 1 learned helplessness decreased for the conditions with high controllability. Surprisingly, for Experiment 2 results showed an overall decrease of learned helplessness independent of the conditions. When adding participants’ ratings on the pro-environmental behavior scale (PEBS-C) as a moderator variable, results showed that those who had higher ratings on the PEBS-C scale reported higher levels of helplessness for the scenario with the lowest controllability, compared to the control group. Our results emphasize the importance of including solutions when addressing the negative impacts of climate change.",

          "abstract": "Autistic masking has typically been understood as the knowing or unknowing suppression of naturalistic Autistic traits within neuronormative social contexts. However, social interactions are inherently embedded within broader sensory environments, suggesting a need to examine masking beyond the social domain. In this Perspective, we introduce and define the concept of Autistic sensory masking - the conscious or unconscious suppression, inhibition, or override of sensory responses to meet environmental or social expectations. Drawing on recent research and our own lived experience, we describe sensory masking, including how it may emerge developmentally - often as a learned adaptation to unsafe or invalidating sensory environments. We then discuss the effects of long-term masking. While sensory masking may sometimes serve a useful function, its chronic and persistent use may contribute to burnout and negatively impact wellbeing and mental health, particularly with long-term exposure to sensory aversive environments. Further, we distinguish sensory masking from two related concepts: sensory anchoring, which refers to the use of stabilising sensory input (via tools or movement) for self-regulation, and sensory unmasking, which involves an individual reclaiming autonomy through encountering safe spaces for sensory self-expression, and embodying flow states such as monotropism. We conclude by outlining constructive approaches that support sensory safety, self-regulation, and wellbeing, and propose future research directions to explore the mechanisms, impacts, and potential supports associated with sensory masking.",

          "abstract": "Students frequently rely on ineffective learning strategies instead of those that promote long-term retention. This tendency is commonly examined through the lens of self-regulated learning, which emphasizes students as generally active and deliberate decision-makers who may lack either the knowledge of effective strategies or the motivational resources to apply them. In this paper, we aim to expand this perspective by investigating the role of non-deliberate, habitual behaviors in students’ use of learning strategies. Drawing on key principles of habit and habit formation, we argue that particularly ineffective learning strategies tend to develop strong habitual tendencies. An overreliance on them may therefore stem not only from a lack of strategy knowledge but also from their automatic activation in response to environmental cues. We support this claim by both theoretically demonstrating how ineffective learning strategy use aligns with habit characteristics and empirically presenting first evidence showing that ineffective strategies exhibit stronger habitual tendencies than effective ones. By framing learning strategy use within a habit-based framework, we aim to offer a novel perspective on students’ persistence with ineffective strategies and suggest new intervention pathways that emphasize behavior-change strategies to foster effective use of learning strategies.",

This study explores team emergent states (team cohesion, team identification, team psychological safety) in Human-AI teams (HATs) compared to purely human teams (HTs). In a laboratory experiment, participants (final N = 67 teams; 134 individuals) completed two successive work-related tasks over two rounds (20 min each). The first round involved two human teammates. The second round introduced a third teammate – either another human (resulting in HTs) or an AI (resulting in HATs). Following the Social Identity Theory, we expected that HATs would exhibit lower levels of team emergent states. Team cohesion and identification were lower in HATs and we found mediating effects of self-rated team performance and team trust. There was no significant difference in perceived team psychological safety. Participants in HATs identified less with the AI than with the human teammate. These findings suggest that traditional team dynamics might not be directly applied to HATs, emphasizing the need for further research on team dynamics to understand the unique impact of AI on teamwork. This research advances our understanding of the implications of integrating AI into teams and provides practical insights for implementing AI while maintaining effective teamwork.",

          "abstract": "School-based mental health screening typically relies on single-time-point assessments, which may lead to inaccuracies in identifying students in need of support. Misclassification as either false positives (students flagged unnecessarily) or false negatives (students needing help but overlooked) can have significant consequences. Mood monitoring, a method that involves repeated assessments over time, may offer a more precise and informative approach to screening. We conducted a mood monitoring study in two schools over seven weeks (United Kingdom, n = 413; Australia, n = 418). Students completed the Brief Emotional Experience Scale (BEES) weekly to assess fluctuations in emotional well-being. At the conclusion of the study, students provided feedback on their experience. While 79% of students maintained consistent moderate to high emotional well-being, 17% fluctuated above and below the threshold for low well-being, and 4% maintained consistently low emotional well-being. This suggests that a single-time-point assessment could misclassify up to one in six students. Additionally, over half of the students reported that mood monitoring helped them better understand their own well-being, and a substantial proportion indicated that it encouraged conversations about mental health with peers, parents, or guardians. By tracking emotional well-being over time, this approach may reduce misclassification errors and enhance students’ emotional awareness and communication about mental health. Future research should focus on optimizing the implementation of mood monitoring in different school contexts and assessing its long-term impact on student well-being.",

How scores on retrospective self-report measures of cognitive restraint and restriction relate to restrictive eating in daily life among women with eating disorders characterized by restrictive eating is unknown. In the current study, the Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory Cognitive Restraint (EPSI-CR) and Restriction (EPSI-R) subscale scores were: 1) compared across women with anorexia nervosa (AN; n = 58), bulimia nervosa (BN; n = 56), avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID; n = 31), and non-eating disorder controls (NED; n = 53), and 2) correlated with frequency of daily restrictive eating reported via two-weeks of ecological momentary assessment. EPSI-CR scores were significantly higher in the AN group than all other groups, and people with BN scored significantly higher than ARFID and NED groups, whose scores did not significantly differ. EPSI-R scores did not significantly vary between AN and ARFID, and these groups both scored higher than BN, who scored higher than NEDs. EPSI-CR scores were not significantly correlated with frequency of restrictive eating in daily life in any diagnostic group, suggesting that past-month cognitive restraint was not associated with dietary restriction in daily life. EPSI-R scores were strongly correlated with frequency of dietary restriction in women with BN and ARFID, but not women with AN, demonstrating a discrepancy between EMA and retrospective responses. Overall, results highlight the importance of differentiating cognitive restraint and restriction when assessing and treating eating disorders.",

          "authors": "Simon Weber; Sarah Anne Kemp; Mark R. Hinder",
          "abstract": "Action cancellation represents a fundamental aspect of human motor control, though the behavioural paradigms used to assess it are methodologically diverse, and capture an incompletely understood combination of processes. Advancing theoretical accounts of action cancellation have motivated increasingly complicated experimental designs, leading some authors to draw comparisons between “simple” and “complex” stopping tasks. The latter describes a mix of paradigms which variably require increased working memory demands, stimulus discrimination, distractor interference, or more complex stimulus-response mappings. This narrative review provides an accessible explanation of commonly implemented complex stopping tasks, selected based on their relevance to current theoretical debates. Throughout, we describe the challenges associated with interpreting performance in these tasks, and highlight future directions for research. Notably, much of the past work using these tasks has applied traditional methods of indexing the speed of stopping, which were developed specifically for simple stopping tasks, and do not generalise well beyond this context. Recent research using cognitive modelling and physiological approaches has failed to replicate earlier findings, raising fundamental questions regarding how action cancellation should be indexed. Furthermore, physiological observations in complex stopping tasks appear to be incompatible with current accounts of the neurological mechanisms that underpin action cancellation. We propose potential ways forward, highlighting how the current lack of well-controlled comparisons between task types means the literature risks extensive task-specific findings that fail to generalise between laboratories, and – critically – beyond the laboratory.",

          "abstract": "Social information aids learning: by making assumptions about other people's knowledge and intentions, people can draw strong and accurate inferences from limited data. In this study, we systematically tested people's ability to reason from information providers with different intentions. The task was an adaptation of Shafto et al (2014)'s rectangle game, where learners guessed a rectangle’s size and location based on provided clues. We examined reasoning based on information from four types of providers: a helpful provider, a provider who sampled randomly, and two misleading providers (who could mislead but not lie). We also varied whether people were given a cover story describing the provider in advance, or whether they could infer how helpful a provider was based on what the provider shared. Participants learned efficiently from helpful providers, aligning closely with the predictions of a normative Bayesian model, even without a cover story. However, while people usually recognized unhelpful providers, they struggled to identify and respond appropriately to misleading strategies. Overall, our results suggest a helpful bias: in our task, participants assumed helpful intent unless given explicit feedback, and even then, they did not fully adjust in line with Bayesian predictions. People also struggled to overcome this bias when learning from randomly sampled information, especially when they had experience being an information provider themselves (Experiment 3).",

          "abstract": "Background:  There is a general assumption that judges assess crimes more reliably than jurors or the general public. Reliability is fundamental for trust and validity. Here, I compare the variability of sentencing intentions of judges and lay people.\n\nQuantifying the variability of sentencing is difficult, because sentencing guidelines impose boundaries on sentence lengths, that cause problems for estimation. I compared two ways to circumvent these problems: (1) by analysing actual sentences as proportions of the guideline range, or (2) by assuming that observed sentences reflect a latent distribution of “true” intentions. In both cases, the primary outcome was the variability of judges’ sentences compared with lay people’s.\n\nMethods: I analysed published sentencing intentions of professional judges and lay people for the same fictional crime. The source study’s sentencing guidelines allowed terms in the range 3-20 years, and over half the participants’ sentencing intentions were at these boundaries. I accounted for these boundary effects by transforming the raw sentence intentions to either (1) to proportions of the allowed range, or (2) to an ordinal variable, with 4 levels (0-9, 10-14, 15-19 or 20 years), representing a latent normal distribution. I then analysed the transformed data using distributional regressions, to assess ‘dispersion’ (reliability) in relation to rater status (judge, lay person)\n\nResults: Accounting for floor and ceiling effects importantly improved estimation of reliability. Judges’ sentencing intentions were more variable than those of lay people in both analyses. The proportional (relative) and ordinal (absolute) methods of analysis estimated lower or higher mean sentences for judges.\n\nConclusion: Distributional regression can assess differential variability, as an indicator of reliability. The present results challenge the assumption that judges assess crimes reliably. This may help to explain the public’s lack of trust in the judicial system. It also throws into question the decisions of single expert raters in other high-stakes contexts.",

While social observational learning did help a significant number of trapped learners escape, the majority of trapped learners remained trapped even after observing a partner demonstrate an optimal decision rule. Across several follow-up experiments, we unpack possible factors which limited the effectiveness of social observational learning. Overall, the results suggest that social decision rule inference (inferring a partner's decision rule from observed choices) was a key bottleneck for observational learning. Simulations show that these results were unanticipated by a leading model of social reward learning, and highlight a central role for inference in social learning.",

          "abstract": "The neural mechanisms of infant speech perception are an important topic of cognitive neuroscientific research. One key theoretical question in this area surrounds the lateralization of infant neural speech responses. Specifically, it is important to determine whether infants have patterns of left lateralization for speech in their frontal and temporal lobes, as is commonly seen in adults. However, the spatial patterns of infant findings are inconsistent; some studies show the frontal and temporal regions of both hemispheres activating, while others demonstrate activation predominantly or only in the left hemisphere. This meta-analysis, for the first time in the field, examines studies using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to determine the field-wide pattern of activation of the frontal and temporal lobes when infants are exposed to speech. In this pre-registered meta-analysis, we first completed a literature search using keywords through various popular online databases: PubMed, Web of Science, and the UBC Library. Papers were screened according to a pre-determined inclusion criterion. Those selected for our review would be analyzed for their methodologies and activation results. We coded the results for each contrast for each paper (e.g., neural activation patterns to speech stimuli vs. baseline). Overall, there was not strong evidence for left lateralization in either the temporal or the frontal lobes. We also did not find evidence that any lateralization pattern changed with age. One analysis revealed that patterns of lateralization in the left hemisphere may differ depending on language familiarity, with a marginally significant pattern of left lateralization when infants hear a familiar language. Overall, this meta-analysis provides an overview of the current state of the field concerning localized neural responses to speech stimuli and provides a field-wide answer to the question of the patterns of lateralization to speech stimuli found in infancy.",

          "authors": "Matteo Visconti di Oleggio Castello; Fatma Deniz; Tom Dupré la Tour; Jack L. Gallant",
          "abstract": "One of the major goals of cognitive neuroscience is understanding how the brain represents information about its own internal states and about the external world. This goal can be addressed by creating encoding models that reveal the information represented explicitly in measured brain activity. Here we describe the Voxelwise Encoding Model (VEM) framework for creating encoding models with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The VEM framework provides several key advantages over traditional neuroimaging approaches. First, the VEM framework is applicable to most experimental designs, from classic factorial designs to complex naturalistic experiments such as movie watching or video games. This flexibility enables researchers to study brain function across multiple domains with the same analytical approach. Second, hypotheses about functional representations are defined and tested quantitatively by extracting feature spaces from experimental stimuli or tasks. These feature spaces quantify specific types of information potentially represented in brain activity and can range from simple human-derived labels to complex features generated by deep neural networks. If a feature space can be used to linearly predict brain activity, the brain is considered to explicitly represent features within that feature space. This prediction approach provides a systematic way to test hypotheses about functional representations. Third, the VEM framework implements robust data science methods to improve model estimation and minimize false positive results. Encoding models are estimated on a training set and validated on an independent test set. Testing in an independent dataset provides direct evidence that experimental findings generalize beyond the dataset used for model estimation. Finally, voxelwise encoding models can be created in each participant's native brain space without unnecessary information loss due to spatial averaging or template resampling required by conventional group analyses. This enables the VEM approach to reveal fine-grained functional organization in individual participants that might otherwise be ignored. In this article, we provide a comprehensive guide to the Voxelwise Encoding Model framework through all phases of research, from experimental design and data collection to the estimation and interpretation of voxelwise encoding models.",

          "abstract": "Survey measures are common in intervention research, but may suffer from biases such as socially desirable responding (SDR). While previous work demonstrates how unaddressed SDR can affect study results in observational contexts, the degree to which SDR may affect treatment effect estimates from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is less studied. To shed light on this issue, we examine empirical data from 10 RCTs from education, psychology, and health fields and compare estimated treatment effects from models that do and do not account for SDR. Results show that, with two exceptions, estimated treatment effects were mostly unaffected by SDR. We complement our empirical results with a simulation study to determine the degree of SDR necessary to bias treatment effects and find that severe SDR can bias treatment effects when not accounted for in the model. However, models accounting for SDR are more complex and produce estimates that are slightly downwardly biased despite being the data-generating model. We conclude with a discussion of recommendations for researchers using survey instruments as outcomes in RCTs.",

          "authors": "Luther Kalb; Micah Kaats; Erin Jones",
          "abstract": "Background: Life satisfaction is a cognitive self-appraisal of one's current circumstances, influenced by both external circumstances (\"bottom-up\" factors) and features of personality (\"top-down\" factors). Life satisfaction is consistently associated with physical and mental health outcomes, making it a public health priority; however, life satisfaction in the US has been precipitously decreasing. The purpose of this study was to identify factors that could be addressed by U.S. policy for the purpose of enhancing population-level life satisfaction.\nMethods: Data for this study came from Wave 1 of the Global Flourishing Study. Seventeen actionable/modifiable variables were selected as covariates. They included a wide variety of behavioral, socioeconomic, psychological, and health factors. All variables were dichotomized for the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) analysis, a decision-tree approach used for problems of classification. This supervised, nonparametric, multivariate method was employed to identify the most accurate set of classifiers for the continuous outcome: Life satisfaction. CART offers several advantages over traditional ordinary least squares regression, including making fewer statistical assumptions, automatically detecting nonlinear relationships, and handling a large number of variables without the risk of multicollinearity. The CART model was trained and tested using a 70/30 split of the US sample (n=38,312). The model was further tested for replication in a combined international sample of similar Western countries (United Kingdom, n=5,368; Australia, n=3,844).\nResults: Of the 17 potential covariates, only 5 were represented in the models: balance, satisfaction with relationships, purpose, mental health, and comfortability with income. Each of the three models had similar numbers of splits (5, 7, 5). In all three models, the CART analysis identified life balance as the primary node. Those with low balance (the left-hand split) had much lower life satisfaction than those who self-reported balance (nearly a 3-point difference in life satisfaction, on average). For those with low balance, mental health was the second node for all datasets, and relationship satisfaction was the final split in the test and international samples. For those with good life balance in the US (the right-hand split), the tree structure was slightly more variable, as splits on purpose, relationships, mental health and comfortability with income were observed. For the international sample, splits only occurred on relationships and purpose.\nConclusions: The results clearly show the primary factors related to life satisfaction. Life balance was the most important, followed by mental health and satisfying relationships for those with low life balance. For those with high life balance, relationships, purpose, and comfortability with income (in the US only) were most important. These findings partially diverge from our hypothesis, as balance served as the most important correlate of life balance. The study findings not only reveal the most important correlates of life satisfaction, replicated across multiple test samples, but also those that were surprisingly less important (e.g., physical health, participation in a social or religious group, exercise). The findings have significant implications for interventions and policy development since all factors included were chosen are modifiable.",

A meta-analysis (Ditto et al., 2019) found that liberals and conservatives were similarly receptive to party cues, shifting their judgement in accordance with their inparty and against their outparty. This finding was criticized, as the empirical studies included in the meta-analysis did not use a representative sample of target issues, limiting the generalizability of the meta-analysis’ conclusions. We address this critique in four preregistered experiments (N’s &gt; 1200), using four measures of ideology. Studies 1 and 2 found convincing evidence for ideological similarities in quota matched samples of Americans. However, Study 3 used a convenience sample and found conservatives were significantly more likely to follow partisan cues. In Study 4, we aimed to resolve this discrepancy using a representative sample of participants and found similarities in cue receptivity on most measures of ideology, except for right-wing authoritarianism. Notably, we replicated ideological differences in cognitive style, suggesting that ideological differences in cognitive style do not necessarily translate into differences in processes for interpreting and integrating partisan-relevant information.",

          "abstract": "Research on sensorimotor synchronization typically examines finger tapping to auditory rhythms. These studies generally investigate timing accuracy, largely neglecting the force of tapping, which provides information on exertion and thus is relevant to clinical applications of cued movement. In two experiments with healthy young and older adults, we examined the possible influence of i) cognitive function, ii) subjective factors, and iii) properties of music on the force of music-cued finger tapping, alongside possible aging effects. We found that better cognitive switching/inhibition ability inversely predicted tapping force, whereas more positively rated emotions induced by the music predicted greater tapping force. Despite known declines of motor and cognitive functions in aging, we found that age group was not a predictive factor of force, suggesting that age does not affect spontaneous force in finger tapping. We examined other relevant factors based on previous findings, including working memory, familiarity with the music, and whether the music was activating, but these also did not predict applied force. These findings demonstrate differential effects of cognitive differences and auditory cue aspects on motor control in finger tapping settings, with practical implications for improving training or rehabilitation that includes music-based movement.",

Our investigation consisted of five mixed-methods studies, including one large-scale survey and four experimental studies, all of which provided converging evidence supporting our hypotheses. Specifically, low self-concept clarity was either associated with (Study 1) or led to (Studies 2 &amp; 3) self-instrumentalization, and anxiety was identified as a key factor mediating this relationship (Studies 3 &amp; 4). Furthermore, we discovered that self-instrumentalization mitigates anxiety stemming from low self-concept clarity (Study 5).

Among available techniques, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is particularly promising for studies outside laboratory environments. fNIRS hyperscanning presents opportunities and challenges in key domains including data processing, the quantification and interpretation of inter-brain synchrony, and increasing interest in multimodal approaches. To assess the field’s current status and trajectory, we developed a questionnaire for fNIRS hyperscanning researchers, addressing both best practices (“what has been done”) and future priorities (“what ought to be done”). Survey responses were compared with the empirical literature to identify unmet needs, align community perspectives, and chart a course for the field’s progression. Findings showed (i) broad agreement on preprocessing workflows, (ii) widespread use of wavelet transform coherence to quantify inter-brain synchrony, and (iii) growing enthusiasm—and a rapidly expanding pool of datasets—for multimodal recording. Meanwhile, (iv) systematic training in fNIRS hyperscanning is largely absent from university curricula, (v) theoretical frameworks for interpreting neural synchrony remain underdeveloped, and (vi) methodological pipelines integrating multimodal behavioral and neural signals are still lacking.

We found a consistent pattern of associations using the data from two culturally different samples of Polish (N = 1143) and British (N = 388) participants. That is, we observed consistent negative relationships between intelligence and socio-psychological variables responsible for out-group derogation: national narcissism and conspiracy beliefs. Moreover, lower national narcissism partially accounted for the association between higher intelligence and lower conspiracy beliefs, which provides initial evidence that higher intelligence may be related not only to a less narcissistic identity but also to weaker endorsement of conspiracy theories. We discuss the implications for understanding the role of intelligence and national narcissism in shaping the psychological roots of susceptibility to conspiracy narratives.",

Five databases, plus pre-print, unpublished and grey literature sources, were searched up to 30 January 2024. Studies were included if published in English, used EMA methodology, included adolescents aged 10-24 years and measured suicidal ideation, suicidal behaviours, or self-harm. The review included 79 studies, published from 2009 to ongoing research. Self-harm was associated with numerous risk factors, including negative affect, stress, interpersonal influences and sleep. EMA was generally well-accepted by adolescent participants, with high compliance rates. The findings highlight the value of EMA in capturing real-time fluctuations in self-harm and associated risk factors among adolescents. EMA demonstrates strong potential for improving understanding and prediction of self-harm; yet challenges remain, including variability in study designs and a lack of clear reporting of the methodologies. Future research should focus on standardising methodologies, increasing participant diversity, and exploring the clinical utility of EMA in early intervention and prevention strategies.",

Employing Item Response Theory, we validate the construct validity of both scales in a preregistered study in the Netherlands (Nmax = 1, 553). Using the same dataset, we demonstrate their predictive validity. The PPIS and NPIS uncover substantial differences in political attitudes and behaviors both between and within individuals who identify as politically (dis)interested.

          "abstract": "Driver visual attention is crucial for the safe transition of control from higher levels of automation to manual driving. Without efficient visual sampling of their surroundings during the transition process, drivers have an increased risk of collisions, due to reduced situation awareness, imposed by automated driving. The use of directional auditory warnings has been proposed as an effective way for guiding drivers’ attention to the right place at the right time, during transitions of control that require a lane change for obstacle avoidance. Here, directional auditory warnings either direct drivers’ attention towards a free lane (i.e., towards-free-lane warnings) or towards a hazard (i.e., towards-hazard warnings). Whilst studies have demonstrated that the towards-hazard warnings facilitate faster hazard detection, relative to non-directional warnings, little is known about the effects of towards-free-lane auditory warnings on gaze behaviours. Studies have also shown that temporal separation of auditory warnings and visual information can improve the effectiveness of warnings, by attenuating the visual dominance effect. However, the impact of this temporal separation on drivers’ gaze behaviour during transitions from automation remains unknown. Using a driving simulator study with forty-eight participants, we investigated how directional auditory warnings and asynchronous presentation of auditory warnings and visual information affect drivers’ gaze behaviour during transitions from a hands-on SAE L2 driving system. Results showed that, compared to non-directional warnings, directional auditory warnings reduced the probability of fixation to wing mirrors. Towards-hazard and towards-free-lane warnings effectively guided drivers’ visual attention to the hazard location and the free lane, respectively, and also led to faster fixations on these areas. However, under towards-hazard warnings, drivers still adhered to their habit of checking the free lane wing mirror during lane changes with these warnings. Finally, longer stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA) were associated with faster fixations to the wing mirrors and quicker hazard detection, suggesting that longer SOAs attenuated visual dominance effect, leading to an increase in the effectiveness of directional auditory warnings in guiding drivers’ visual attention. Findings from this study provide valuable insights for the design of in-vehicle warning systems in automated vehicles.",

Confirmatory factor analysis supported the original bifactor structure, with fit indices closely matching previous validations. Internal consistency (α ~ .80) and test–retest reliability (r ~ .85) were high for most subscales and the general factor. The Gold-MSI effectively distinguished individuals with extensive musical training and expertise from those with limited or no training. Musical sophistication was positively associated with openness to experience, extraversion, and, among younger participants, with family socioeconomic status. The Spanish Gold-MSI demonstrated strong psychometric properties, supporting its use in Spanish-speaking populations and enabling future cross-cultural research on musical behavior.",

Reasons for this vulnerability remain unclear. We investigated how peer bullying and family conflict (age 10-15 years) and loneliness and social connection (age 16-24 years) related at different levels of socio-economic marginalisation. \nMethods: Using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Survey (N=2,531), we captured loneliness and social connection at 16-24 years and bullying and family conflict at 10-15 years. Network analysis tested item-level relationships, whilst controlling for others. We devised a socio-economic marginalisation score, based on household income related to community average household income, to classify participants into high and low groups and to compare networks across groups. \nResults: Most central items in the full sample network were talking to family about worries, talking to friends about worries, and relying on friends (16-24 years), and peer bullying (10-15 years). Distinct facets of loneliness linked to specific social connection and bullying experiences. For example, feeling left out was associated with feeling let down by friends (w=-.10), feeling less understood by friends (w=-.05). Whereas feeling isolated was associated with feeling less understood by family (w=-.11) and less understood by friends (w=-.04). Peer bullying related to feeling more left out (w=.05) and more isolated (w=.04). Some associations (e.g., feeling less let down and less criticised by family) were stronger in the high socio-economic marginalisation group, who also reported more severe bullying. \nConclusion: Evidence suggested family relationships remain important in late adolescence. Findings highlight the value of item-level dynamics for targeted support. Past bullying, feeling let down, left out and isolated may be key intervention targets, especially for adolescence experiencing high socio-economic marginalization.",

Here we show that observers’ uncertainty about their decisions incorporates both the entropy of the stimuli and the entropy of their response probabilities across the psychometric function. Describing uncertainty data with a functional form permits the measurement of internal parameters not measurable from the decision responses alone. To test and demonstrate the utility of this novel model, we measured uncertainty in 11 participants as they judged the relative contrast appearance of two stimuli in several experiments employing explicit bias or attentional cues. The entropy model enabled an otherwise intractable quantitative analysis of participants’ uncertainty, which in one case distinguished two comparative judgments that produced nearly identical psychometric functions. In contrast, comparative and equality judgments with different behavioral reports, yielded uncertainty reports that were not significantly different. The entropy model was able to successfully account for uncertainty in these two different types of decisions that resulted in differently shaped psychometric functions, and the entropy contribution from the stimuli, which were identical across experiments, was consistent. An observer’s uncertainty could therefore be measured as the total entropy of the inputs and outputs of the stimulus-response system, i.e. the entropy of the stimuli plus the entropy of the observer’s responses.",

          "abstract": "People often rely on simulating the other person’s state of mind when trying to understand and predict their behaviour. Likewise, converging evidence suggests similar cognitive and neural processes are engaged when making decisions for ourselves and when predicting the decisions of others, pointing towards mental simulation as the underlying mechanism of prediction. In this study, we tested this hypothesis directly, leveraging the fact that, under the simulation hypothesis, any predictions made with a biased decision-making process should also be biased. We first induced a bias in participant’s risk perception by adapting them to contexts with high or low risks, and then asked them to predict decisions of a risk-seeking and risk-averse agent in a mediumrisk context. Our findings provide partial support for the simulation hypothesis; the adaptation manipulation resulted in biased predicted decisions, suggesting that these predictions were made with participants’ own (biased) decision-making system. Surprisingly, this behavioural effect only emerged during predictions for a risk-averse, but not risk-seeking agent. Modeling predictions with the drift-diffusion model suggested that the prediction bias mapped onto a group difference in the risk tendency parameter when predicting for the risk-averse, but not risk-seeking agent. Furthermore, participants’ risk tendency when deciding for themselves correlated with predicted behaviour of the risk-averse, but not risk-seeking agent, suggesting the perceived similarity of the other agent as a mediating factor. Altogether, our findings support the view that people engage in simulating others’ decisions with their own mind, but also suggest that the perceived similarity with the other person may determine their prediction strategy.",

A key distinction within the literature separates “hot” (emotionally or motivationally influenced) and “cool” (affectively neutral) executive function skills. However, it remains unclear whether these skills follow similar or distinct developmental trajectories from infancy to early childhood. To fill this knowledge gap, this longitudinal study examined the development of hot and cool inhibitory control (a core executive function) across three time points in infancy and early childhood: 10-months (N = 141), 16-months (N = 75) and 3½ years (N = 93). To track age-related changes whilst minimising bias from differences in task demands, we used scalable or structurally similar inhibitory control tasks across all assessment points. As expected, both hot and cool inhibitory control significantly improved from infancy to early childhood, however the improvement happened earlier for hot inhibitory control. Hot and cool inhibitory control were not significantly associated in infancy, but a hot-cool association emerged by 3½ years. In terms of longitudinal stability, individual differences in hot (but not cool) inhibitory control were stable from 10- to 16-months of age, however neither facet of inhibitory control demonstrated longitudinal associations between infancy and early childhood. Hot IC at 16 months predicted performance on one of the cool IC tasks (Go/No-Go) at 3.5 years, although this result did not survive correction for multiple comparisons so should be replicated in future research. These findings provide new insights into the early developmental trajectories of hot and cool inhibitory control, highlighting both their initial independence in infancy and later convergence at the start of early childhood.",

          "abstract": "Objective:\nThis study evaluates the psychometric properties of the Short Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS) among adolescents from seven culturally and linguistically diverse countries.\nMethod:\nA total of 4,006 adolescents (ages 11–18) from 18 schools across Bahrain, Canada, Germany, India, Sweden, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates completed the SWEMWBS as part of a school-based wellbeing survey. Participants responded in either English (n = 3,358) or French (n = 648). We examined internal consistency (Cronbach’s α and McDonald’s ω), conducted confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test unidimensionality, evaluated cross-national measurement invariance using multi-group CFA (MGCFA), and applied Item Response Theory (IRT) analyses to assess item discrimination, response thresholds, and measurement precision.\nResults:\nThe SWEMWBS demonstrated acceptable-to-good internal consistency across all countries (α = .76–.82; ω = .76–.83) and a unidimensional structure with strong model fit (CFI = .983, RMSEA = .065). Full scalar invariance was supported across countries. IRT analyses showed that items 2 (\"feeling useful\") and 5 (\"thinking clearly\") offered the highest information, while country-specific patterns suggested subtle differences in item functioning. The test was most informative for adolescents with low-to-average mental wellbeing (θ ≈ −2.5 to +1.5). Intra-class correlation (ICC) indicated minimal school-level clustering (ICC = 0.037).\nConclusion:\nFindings support the SWEMWBS as a reliable, unidimensional, and cross-culturally valid measure of adolescent mental wellbeing. These results provide psychometric justification for its use in global adolescent health research.",

          "abstract": "Intergroup bias modulates both Theory of Mind (ToM) during social judgments, yet behavioural measures alone cannot fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Multimodal approaches are therefore needed to uncover the corresponding neural correlates. Here, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate how intergroup bias shapes neural responses during smile discrimination–a proxy for ToM. Thirty-three adults viewed videos of ingroup or outgroup members displaying genuine or posed smiles, judging smile authenticity (ToM) and smiler gender (Gender), with facial expressions recorded. Behaviourally, no intergroup bias emerged; however, neuroimaging data revealed distinct pathways: ingroup smiles engaged the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), whereas outgroup smiles activated the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). ToM conditions elicited stronger IFG and superior temporal cortex (STC) responses for outgroup members compared with Gender conditions. Although facial mimicry was absent, integrated fNIRS and facial analyses demonstrated that intergroup bias differentially recruits neural systems during ToM-driven smile processing. These findings indicate that social affiliation and cognitive control networks are sensitive to ingroup cues, while outgroup cues elicit greater mentalizing, potentially reflecting perceptions of outgroup members as less trustworthy and requiring more effortful interpretation.",

This largely underappreciated polysemy problem prevents associative accounts of biological cognitive systems from being properly articulated, understood and criticized. Based on a review traversing psychological, neuronal and behavioral sciences, we delineate and characterize these five categories of usage, to show how such classification improves transparency across fields and casts new light on various debates.

          "abstract": "Young people and university students are particularly vulnerable to the mental health effects of climate change due to their prolonged lifetime exposure to, and increased contact with, climate change and related information through learning. Despite this, little research exists on how university students cope with climate change from a psychological perspective. In this largely qualitative mixed-methods study, we analysed data from an online survey to investigate how students (N = 823) of a large UK university cope with climate change. This survey covered which climate change situations were triggering for them, preferences for support-seeking, and specific coping strategies. Conceptual content analysis revealed that challenging situations included navigating climate change information, climate justice issues, climatic changes and environmental losses, and climate change dismissal. Findings from qualitative framework analysis further showed four ways students coped with these: by reducing the mental load of climate change, doing something constructive, seeking social support and meaning, and doomist thinking and behaviour. While many students highlighted the importance of social connections, a small minority considered seeking professional support. These findings partly support and expand on climate change-related coping literature and have implications for how higher education settings communicate about and act on climate change.",

Such Neurodevelopmental Hyperacusis (HAND) is often part of sensory over-responsivity associated with neuropsychiatric differences. To better understand the impact of HAND on individuals’ lives, this study aimed to estimate the magnitude of the effect of HAND on quality of life (QoL) using causal inference. Given previously established relationships between sensory sensitivity and anxiety, we also aimed to estimate the role of anxiety as a mediator of this effect. We recruited 174 legal guardians of children (8–11 years old), and collected informant-rated scores for QoL, HAND, and anxiety, as well as data on confounders identified using a causal graph. There was a large total negative effect of HAND on QoL, with a significant proportion mediated through anxiety. Post-hoc analyses indicated that almost all domains of QoL were negatively affected by HAND, with especially large effect sizes for psychological, emotional and social domains. We discuss the results in the light of our causal assumptions and conclude that 1) intervention for HAND would likely improve both QoL and anxiety in affected individuals, and 2) anxiety treatment would achieve some, but not all, of this beneficial effect on QoL.",

The psychological, emotional, and academic repercussions of bullying are profound, influencing not only victims but also perpetrators and bystanders. This literature review explores the critical role of psychological resilience—a dynamic capacity to adapt positively despite adversity—across these three groups. Resilience acts as a protective factor for victims, helping to mitigate depression, anxiety, and social withdrawal while empowering bystanders to adopt prosocial behaviors. For perpetrators, fostering resilience can redirect aggressive tendencies into constructive leadership. The review synthesizes theoretical frameworks, empirical studies, and intervention strategies, highlighting the interplay of individual traits, family dynamics, peer networks, and school climates in shaping resilience. It concludes by emphasizing resilience-focused interventions, teacher training, and policy reforms as transformative tools for creating inclusive and supportive school environments.",

          "abstract": "The research into bilingual inhibitory control advantage in pre-verbal infants is very limited and has inconsistent findings. One possible explanation for this inconclusion is the appropriateness of tasks used to measure inhibitory control in young participants. This study used the Early Childhood Inhibitory Touchscreen Task (ECITT; Holmboe et al., 2021) to measure response inhibition in infants aged 10 and 16 months (N=205). A significant effect of inhibitory control (better performance on accuracy and reaction time; p&lt;.001 [-.47, -32]) was found, such that performance was better when there was no inhibitory demand. This did not differ depending on the age of the infant (10 or 16 months), language background (monolingual or bilingual), or the interaction of age and language. This suggests that exposure to two languages (measured crudely) does not influence inhibitory control in young infants or at least may not be detectable in behavioural tests under 16 months old.",

          "abstract": "Statistical learning is a powerful mechanism that can support a variety of learning tasks. Many theories have assumed a single mechanism for statistical learning across different tasks, where a unitary mechanism is supposed to explain results from various studies, even across different modalities. In this study, we studied auditory statistical learning by comparing two different experimental paradigms, target detection and word segmentation, and examined if different mechanisms are required to explain results from the two paradigms. Previous work using the word segmentation paradigm suggested that learning is better with sequences containing uniform-length words than with sequences containing mixed-length words. If the same mechanism supports the target detection task, the same results are predicted. However, while learning was successful in both Experiments 1 and 2 with the target detection paradigm, the effect was larger in the mixed condition than in the uniform condition. We further replicated the uniform condition advantage in the word segmentation paradigm in Experiment 3. Thus, we hypothesized that the target detection paradigm required a different mechanism from those in word segmentation. To understand these mechanisms, we proposed both theoretical analyses and a computational model to simulate results from the target detection paradigm. We found that a prediction mechanism, rather than clustering, could explain the data from target detection. Crucially, this mechanism can produce facilitation effects without performing segmentation. We discuss both the theoretical and empirical reasons why the target detection and word segmentation paradigm might engage different processes, and how these findings contribute to our understanding of statistical word segmentation.",

          "abstract": "This research evaluates the mediation and moderation of an efficacious physical activity (PA) intervention designed for African American men living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Physical activity is a crucial element in managing the health of individuals with HIV, but African American men represent a population that is disproportionately affected by HIV and often faces barriers to engaging in regular PA. We analyzed data obtained from a randomized controlled trial (N = 302) that recruited African American men living with HIV who are 40 years or older and randomly assigned them to a PA intervention group or a health-awareness control group. We collected data at baseline, immediate post-intervention, and 3-, 6-, and 12-month post-intervention. We examined whether the intervention’s effect on adherence to PA guidelines was mediated through the Reasoned Action Approach and the Social Cognitive Theory constructs, including attitudes, social norms, self-efficacy, and intention. We explored whether individual characteristics, including Body Mass Index (BMI), Waist-Hip Ratio (WHR), age, education level, and marital status, influenced the intervention’s effect. We found that self-efficacy mediated the intervention’s effect (α×β×γ product = 0.125, 95% ACI [0.053, 0.229]) by influencing intentions. Statistical analyses did not identify significant moderations of the intervention effect by age, marital status, education level, BMI, or WHR. These findings suggest that interventions to enhance PA among African American men living with HIV should particularly focus on boosting self-efficacy to exercise. Future research should explore additional psychological mechanisms and potential moderators to further refine and tailor PA interventions for this population.",

This is especially important in countries like China, where family support is highly valued and families often live in extended family households. We used semi-structured interviews with 16 Chinese parents of autistic children from diverse educational and income backgrounds and focus group discussions with 11 service providers, to explore their perspectives of the role of extended relatives in the care of autistic children. Using template thematic analysis, we developed three themes: (1) Unambiguous active support from extended relatives: “my siblings and parents always remind me to take good care of my child”; (2) Complex or ambivalent support: “when it comes to grandparents, things can get complicated”; (3) Disengagement in care or stigmatising attitudes: “I felt they didn’t see my son as worthy”. Extended relatives’ supportive or unsupportive roles were perceived to be linked with the timing of a child’s diagnosis, early intervention opportunities, parents’ social and mental well-being, and family functioning. Each theme also considers the underlying individual and family characteristics that may influence the extended relatives’ willingness to support the autistic children and their parents. More effort is needed to help extended relatives better understand autism. This may include building on support from relatives who were already helpful, turning limited supporters into active partners, and addressing negative attitudes to reduce stigma; targeted support is especially needed for families from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.",

          "abstract": "Although sports-themed video games (SVG) are some of the most popular and profitable video games, there is a lack of research regarding video gaming and gambling behaviors of SVG players. To date, research suggests that sports fandom may drive SVG play, as engagement in SVGs is an extension of sports consumption. Evidence also suggests that sports fandom is associated with more sports betting and other gambling. Despite these findings, research has yet to explore the differences between SVG players and non-SVG (NSVG) players across their video gaming and gambling engagement including measures of problem video gaming (PVG) and problem gambling (PG). The present study addresses this gap in the literature using online survey data from two independent samples from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk: N = 1,990, 53.1% Male; Mage = 40.14, SD = 11.80) and Academic Prolific (N = 2,212, 68.4% Male, Mage = 33.18, SD = 9.94). Results showed that SVG players had higher frequency video gaming and gambling, and greater prevalence of PVG and PG relative to NSVG players. Further, SVG players also reported higher frequency of video gaming-related gambling, such as loot box purchases and e-sports gambling, suggesting a strong overlap of video gaming and gambling among SVG players. This is the first study to show a significant risk for SVG players in terms of PG. The discussion focuses on the next steps for research.",

          "abstract": "Heterogeneity has been proposed as a framework to improve psychological and behavioral science by identifying mechanisms that explain the differences between replications of an effect. Both in theory and in practice, the scope of such analyses has been limited to identifying how much effects vary, adding moderators to the meta-analytic model, and evaluating whether less residual heterogeneity remains to be explained. Notably, the underlying functional relationship between the independent and the dependent variable of the experiment is rarely considered as a contributor to effect heterogeneity. Ignoring its influence on heterogeneity, as well as additional information beyond the distribution of true effects, increases the risk of misinterpreting meta-analytic results. We introduce more elaborate descriptions of heterogeneity for such multi-lab projects that can serve as tools to assess if effect heterogeneity could be affected by non-linearity. Instead of focusing on a single heterogeneity estimate, we propose to identify patterns of heterogeneity that allow us to meaningfully connect meta-analytic practice with theory development. Further, the growing body of large-scale direct replication multi-lab projects provides a rich and still emergent basis for heterogeneity research to consider. We apply the analyses to an initial pool of 55 meta-analytic data sets to demonstrate the overlooked variety in patterns of heterogeneity and find evidence for and against the impact of non-linearity on replication effects. Finally, we discuss issues with design choices by previous multi-lab projects and future directions for a heterogeneity paradigm that is more attentive to the variety of contributors and patterns related to effect heterogeneity.",

When recognizing faces, most humans consistently land their first fixation on the face just below the eyes (upper lookers), but some individuals fixate closer to the mouth (lower lookers). Do differences in long-term eye movement strategies influence the ability to process featural and configural facial information? To investigate this, we tested face recognition in upper and lower lookers using specially designed face stimuli that isolated variation in featural or configural information across exemplars, while fixating either at the eye or mouth regions. We found that upper lookers had superior recognition for configural faces than lower lookers, especially when fixating on the eyes. Using single-feature faces, we found that the upper lookers’ advantage arises from efficient extraction of configural face information from the eye region.",

          "abstract": "Emotion recognition is a fundamental aspect of social communication, yet most research has focused on visual emotion expressions, leaving less understood how auditory and audiovisual cues shape perceptual organization. The present study used representational similarity analysis (RSA) to examine how the structure of emotion recognition differs across modalities. Participants completed an emotion recognition task involving 14 emotions presented in auditory, visual, and audiovisual formats. Confusion matrices were computed for each modality and converted into representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs). Hierarchical clustering was applied to RDMs using silhouette-based cutoffs to identify emotion clusters. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) was also conducted on confusion profiles to provide two-dimensional visualizations of emotion space. Results revealed that audiovisual recognition produced the highest degree of distinctness, with most emotions forming singleton clusters and only a few small groupings. Visual recognition showed more cohesive clusters organized largely by valence. In contrast, auditory recognition yielded the broadest multi-emotion groupings, where vocal cues blurred categorical boundaries and produced clusters that combined positive and negative states. Together, these findings demonstrate that the perceptual organization of emotion recognition varies by modality. Audiovisual cues enhanced distinctiveness, visual cues reinforced valence-based structure, and auditory cues fostered broader clusters across valence boundaries. By integrating RSA and MDS, this study highlights the importance of moving beyond accuracy to examine the representational structure of emotion perception across sensory modalities.",

          "abstract": "As the world globalizes, a greater volume of cross-cultural interactions produces more opportunities for cultural transmission across group lines. How do psychological processes shape this transmission of cultural information between groups? We examine how people’s perceptions of other nations shape their willingness to transmit cultural information from individuals in that nation to others within their own nation. Drawing on theories of prestige-based cultural transmission, we tested whether people were more likely to transmit cultural information from individuals whose countries are perceived as internationally influential. We also tested whether this effect was shaped by two theoretically motivated moderators: the domain of information shared by a model (instrumental vs. value-oriented), and perceived competition with the model’s country. Across four studies using correlational (Study 1) and experimental (Studies 2-4) methods, and across samples from both the United States and New Zealand (Study 4), we found consistent evidence that international influence increases transmission of instrumental—but not value-oriented—cultural information across national borders. The role of competition is less consistent, sometimes moderating the effect of influence (Study 1), sometimes independently increasing transmission of instrumental—but not value-oriented—cultural information (Studies 3 &amp; 4), and varying across countries (Study 4). Together, these results suggest that psychological processes may support the transmission of norms from globally influential nations, but that this effect may be critically bounded by the type of cultural information in question, with implications for how cultural norms, practices, and traditions may flow across borders and ultimately shape large-scale cultural change.",

          "authors": "Temenuzhka Dimova; Nicolas Lapique; Raphael Rosenberg",
          "abstract": "We studied the perception of 16th- and 17th-century narrative paintings in three distinct groups: Deaf Sign Language users (ÖGS), Art History Experts, and Lay viewers. By combining eye-tracking data with open interviews, we aimed to test whether Deaf signers and art Experts would exhibit similar viewing behaviors due to their enhanced visual skills. We found that, despite lacking formal training in art history, Deaf viewers displayed oculometric patterns closely resembling those of Experts. These included shorter fixation durations, broader exploration of the pictorial surface, and increased attention to semantically meaningful elements such as symbolic objects and codified hand gestures. Both Deaf participants and Experts also used more concrete and detailed language to describe the paintings, in contrast to Lay viewers, who tended to offer more general and vague statements. Additionally, Deaf participants exhibited a distinctive pattern when viewing faces, focusing more on the mouth area than the eyes, likely due to visual habits of speech perception. These findings suggest a perceptual overlap between two populations with distinct cultural backgrounds and sensory experiences. Sign language mastery and early deafness may enhance visual perception and image interpretation. The results have broader implications for cognitive science, art history, and Deaf studies, demonstrating the value of cross-domain expertise in understanding human perception. They also support the inclusion of Deaf individuals in art history and museum careers, aligning with the concept of Deaf Gain.",

          "authors": "Temenuzhka Dimova; Nicolas Lapique; Raphael Rosenberg",
          "abstract": "Pointing gestures are among the most common hand signs in early modern painting. Art historians have long assumed that they directly guide the viewer’s gaze towards key elements. However, this assumption has never been tested empirically. To investigate how depicted pointing gestures influence eye movements, we digitally removed the pointed forefingers from 15 paintings (16th-17th cent.) and compared the perception of these edited versions with the originals. Our results challenge traditional assumptions. While pointing fingers attract few direct fixations, their fleeting perception significantly reshapes how other elements are viewed. Semantically related areas – such as the targets of pointing gestures and the faces of pointing characters – receive increased direct attention. Also, pointing characters play a stronger role in saccadic transitions between areas of interest. Finally, our novel AOI dwell time correlation method reveals that viewers establish different semantic connections between characters and objects when pointing gestures are present. In the second phase of the study, open-ended interviews revealed that interpretations of the original paintings differ from those of the edited versions. These results underscore the central role of depicted pointing gestures. Rather than merely directing the viewer’s attention from one point to another, as art theoreticians had assumed, they reshape the narrative connections between elements, ultimately leading to different interpretations. Among all the artworks we analyzed, Caravaggio’s and Raphael’s compositions were the most affected by the removal of pointing gestures. This confirms that the effectiveness of pointing gestures in art also depends on individual artistic approaches and the artist’s mastery in guiding the viewer’s attention.",

          "abstract": "It is commonly assumed that people can use advance cues to proactively prepare for conflict from distracting stimulus features, yet empirical findings remain inconsistent. We hypothesized that that nature of stimulus-response (SR) mappings may be a key determinant of cue effectiveness, as vocal Stroop tasks (with non-arbitrary color-naming responses) have shown reliable cue benefits while manual Stroop tasks (with arbitrary key-press responses) typically have not. Across five experiments, we tested this hypothesis by using a spatial Stroop task with non-arbitrary SR mappings, where participants responded to the direction of arrow stimuli using spatially corresponding keys, while trying to ignore the spatially congruent or incongruent location of the stimuli. Despite robust congruency effects and optimal preparation conditions (100% valid cues, 2000ms preparation time), we observed no cue benefits in four experiments. Only when task difficulty was increased substantially (50ms stimulus presentation, Experiment 4) did cue benefits emerge, but exclusively for congruent trials. These findings document that non-arbitrary SR mappings are not a sufficient condition for ensuring cue-based engagement of proactive control, and suggest that cost-benefit calculations about control exertion may be a more promising candidate factor.",

          "abstract": "Identity shift is a key phenomenon in contemporary scholarship on media psychology. Carr et al. (2021) proposed identity shift theory (IST) to explain this phenomenon. This paper clarifies and tests IST. Our clarified IST posits private self-awareness, public self-awareness, and identification with claim as moderators of identity shift, with private and public self-awareness influenced by identifiability and perceived publicness, respectively. Across two studies (n1 = 203; n2 = 780), we provide a near-comprehensive test of the clarified IST, conducting the first empirical test of several key mechanisms in the context of identity shift. Identifiability did not influence private self-awareness and perceived publicness did not influence public self-awareness. Identification with claim, but not private or public self-awareness, consistently moderated identity shift. We conclude by arguing that these findings suggest a possible reorientation of identity shift scholarship away from identifiability and publicness—central to early identity shift theorizing and IST—and toward biased scanning—central to early identity shift theorizing but dropped from IST.",

          "authors": "Juan Vidal-Perez; Raymond J Dolan; Rani Moran",
          "abstract": "A central challenge in cognitive science is to distinguish between multiple processes that can result in similar behaviours. In reinforcement learning (RL), one prominent example concerns two potential drivers of choice repetition: (i) a confirmation-bias learning asymmetry, in which agents learn more from outcomes that confirm their choices, and (ii) choice perseveration, an outcome-independent tendency to repeat past choices. Evidence for asymmetric learning has typically relied on computational models that control for perseveration, or specific behavioural markers designed to reveal asymmetric learning. Here, we show both these approaches have critical flaws and can spuriously detect learning asymmetries even in perseverative, symmetric-learning agents. To address this, we introduce a novel statistical test that distinguishes genuine learning asymmetries from spurious effects. Applying this test to a large dataset spanning ten published experiments, we find that some previously reported confirmation biases are fragile, albeit others remain robust even at a meta-analytic level. Finally, we propose a new task design that can yield a more valid qualitative signature of confirmation bias. We suggest our approach provides a reliable framework for disentangling processes underlying choice repetition, while providing tools for the wider research community that can minimize potential spurious effects arising from process mimicry and biased parameter estimation.",

          "abstract": "In order to maximize reward, humans need to balance engaging with currently available sources of reward and searching for better ones. Optimal foraging theory provides a formal but simple mathematical choice rule to make such stay/leave decisions, contrasting expected and experienced rewards. However, this rule (given by the Marginal Value Theorem; MVT) describes a strategy that does not consider the structure of the environment. In other words, it does not leave room for planning during foraging. Yet, the real world is replete with such opportunities. Therefore, we developed a new structured foraging task to study how people employ goal-directed planning during foraging. Specifically, we explore the extent to which participants incorporate an internal model of the task structure during stay/leave decisions. We find that behavior in this task follows the basic principles of the MVT, but that its structure invites people to also consider the value of alternative reward options when deciding to leave their current one. Importantly, this behavior is pronounced in more goal-directed participants. Computational modeling suggests that incorporating this alternative information is beneficial, but to an extent dictated by choice stochasticity. This study provides a novel method for studying decision making in structured environments, and has implications for understanding how foraging and planning interact.",

Here we show that observers’ uncertainty about their decisions incorporates both the entropy of the stimuli and the entropy of their response probabilities across the psychometric function. Describing uncertainty data with a functional form permits the measurement of internal parameters not measurable from the decision responses alone. To test and demonstrate the utility of this novel model, we measured uncertainty in 11 participants as they judged the relative contrast appearance of two stimuli in several experiments employing explicit bias or attentional cues. The entropy model enabled an otherwise intractable quantitative analysis of participants’ uncertainty, which in one case distinguished two comparative judgments that produced nearly identical psychometric functions. In contrast, comparative and equality judgments with different behavioral reports, yielded uncertainty reports that were not significantly different. The entropy model was able to successfully account for uncertainty in these two different types of decisions that resulted in differently shaped psychometric functions, and the entropy contribution from the stimuli, which were identical across experiments, was consistent. An observer’s uncertainty could therefore be measured as the total entropy of the inputs and outputs of the stimulus-response system, i.e. the entropy of the stimuli plus the entropy of the observer’s responses.",

However, due to a key methodological difference, their experiments can only be seen as partial replications of the original study. Here, we reply to all the challenges by Hirschhorn and Mudrik. Furthermore, we discuss issues that go beyond these original studies and that are critical for the consciousness science at large. In particular, we review controversial concepts, including gist and richness. Most importantly, we argue that participants’ reports about their experience should not be rejected by experimenters’ expectations about their experience, which is a fundamental issue in consciousness research. Instead of the (researchers’ expected) veridicality of experiences, focus should be put more on the “what-it-is-like” to be a participant. We also highlight that our free-report paradigm is designed to quantify the specificity of reported words rather than richness. Finally, we show that freely descriptive words reflect participants’ conscious perception. A set of 5 response words is enough to specify the presented image to the degree that is way above the chance.",

Traditionally the answer has been determined by (possibly innate) grammatical ‘binding principle’ constraints. The present work instead tests the claim of functionalist-pragmatic accounts that interpretation is determined primarily by what the speaker most plausibly intends to convey. For example, by using the low-frequency, marked reflexive form himself, the speaker is highlighting that the entity affected by the action is – unusually – also the agent of that action. In a forced-choice sentence-completion paradigm (with accompanying animations), we examined whether adults’ (N = 60) and 6- to 7-year-olds’ (N = 60; M = 6;10) use of a reflexive (himself) versus a non-reflexive pronoun (him) is determined by functional-pragmatic constraints. In a baseline ‘agentive’ condition (e.g., Samuel brushed paint all over…) both adults and children rarely used him over their preferred choice of himself. But in a ‘stative’ condition where the PATIENT is NOT necessarily the AGENT (e.g., Samuel has paint all over…) both adults and children were significantly more likely to choose him. This raises the possibility that discourse-pragmatic constraints can explain phenomena traditionally attributed to syntactic binding principles.",

          "authors": "Matteo Visconti di Oleggio Castello; Fatma Deniz; Tom Dupré la Tour; Jack L. Gallant",
          "abstract": "One of the major goals of cognitive neuroscience is understanding how the brain represents information about its own internal states and about the external world. This goal can be addressed by creating encoding models that reveal the information represented explicitly in measured brain activity. Here we describe the Voxelwise Encoding Model (VEM) framework for creating encoding models with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The VEM framework provides several key advantages over traditional neuroimaging approaches. First, the VEM framework is applicable to most experimental designs, from classic factorial designs to complex naturalistic experiments such as movie watching or video games. This flexibility enables researchers to study brain function across multiple domains with the same analytical approach. Second, hypotheses about functional representations are defined and tested quantitatively by extracting feature spaces from experimental stimuli or tasks. These feature spaces quantify specific types of information potentially represented in brain activity and can range from simple human-derived labels to complex features generated by deep neural networks. If a feature space can be used to linearly predict brain activity, the brain is considered to explicitly represent features within that feature space. This prediction approach provides a systematic way to test hypotheses about functional representations. Third, the VEM framework implements robust data science methods to improve model estimation and minimize false positive results. Encoding models are estimated on a training set and validated on an independent test set. Testing in an independent dataset provides direct evidence that experimental findings generalize beyond the dataset used for model estimation. Finally, voxelwise encoding models can be created in each participant's native brain space without unnecessary information loss due to spatial averaging or template resampling required by conventional group analyses. This enables the VEM approach to reveal fine-grained functional organization in individual participants that might otherwise be ignored. In this article, we provide a comprehensive guide to the Voxelwise Encoding Model framework through all phases of research, from experimental design and data collection to the estimation and interpretation of voxelwise encoding models.",

Participants decided whether an amount of effort (handgrip squeeze) was worth a reward (points). Reward and effort were parametrically manipulated to independently estimate effects of effort and reward. \n\nResults: Compared to HC, individuals with MDD were less willing to accept offers with low reward and low expected value (high effort requirements and low reward). Computational analyses using a Hierarchical drift diffusion modeling (DDM) mirrored these findings, suggesting that evidence accumulation in MDD compared to HC was 1) faster when rejecting high effort options, 2) slower when accepting high reward options. Additionally, higher fatigue was associated with reduced ECDM in those with MDD, particularly for offers with high effort and low expected value.\n\nConclusion: Our results provide support that reduced ECDM in MDD reflects both diminished reward valuation and heightened effort valuation. Further, we found that fatigue severity was associated with reduced ECDM. These results contribute to a growing body of evidence showing reduced ECDM in MDD and identifies the role that fatigue has in shaping these impairments.",

          "authors": "Susannah Pick; Matthew Hotopf",
          "abstract": "Functional neurological disorder (FND) is characterised by involuntary, distressing neurological symptoms that are distinguishable from other neurological diagnoses in presentation, aetiology and mechanisms. Significant disability, impaired quality-of-life, and substantial healthcare resource utilisation often results from the disorder, yet its underlying mechanisms have not been proven empirically. Importantly, long-term clinical trajectories and predictive markers have been understudied in FND cohorts. Inadequate funding of large-scale mechanistic and longitudinal research, methodological limitations, and the absence of standardised outcome measures, necessitate development of innovative solutions. Digital remote monitoring technologies (dRMTs), which have been shown to be valuable across a range of other neurological and psychiatric disorders, may have unparalleled potential to address these research challenges in FND, yet this potential is currently unrealised. We propose that dRMTs could be harnessed to monitor subjective and/or objective functional neurological and associated symptoms, mechanistic variables, and important outcome domains, with excellent temporal precision, flexibility, and external validity. These methods could allow precise characterisation of both short- and long-term fluctuations in FND symptoms, the influences on them, and their impact on patients. Such data would strengthen mechanistic models, improve outcome prediction, and facilitate personalised FND clinical management in this underserved population.",

          "authors": "Hannah Comtesse; Kirsten V. Smith",
          "abstract": "Yearning is hallmark of grief and prolonged grief, but its psychological underpinnings are poorly understood. We aimed to address this by building on the phenomenological similarities with craving and investigating the role of desire thinking, a voluntary cognitive process central to activating craving. A community sample of bereaved adults (N = 676) completed the Oxford Grief Desire Thinking Scale (OG-DT). Psychometric validity of the two-factor solution (imaginal reunion, elaborative efforts) was excellent. Another three-wave longitudinal sample (N = 275) completed the OG-DT and measures of yearning and proximity-seeking at 0–6 months after loss as well as 6 and 12 months later. Yearning mediated the relationship between both imaginal reunion and elaborative efforts and proximity-seeking behaviors. These findings suggest that desire thinking may be a cognitive driver of yearning, which in turn motivates efforts to cope with the desire. Thus, desire thinking could present a new modifiable target for intervention.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Men are more reluctant than women to engage with psychotherapy. Incels—an online community of involuntary celibates—have been identified as needing mental health intervention. Despite high rates of depression, suicidality, and social isolation, little is formally known about their therapy experiences or attitudes. \n\nMethods: We conducted qualitative discourse analysis of 100 psychotherapy discussion threads from incels.is, the largest incel forum. We coded experiences of 89 users who reported attending therapy, analyzing therapist gender, motivation, and satisfaction. Inductive thematic analysis identified community attitudes toward psychotherapy.\n\nResults: Among incels reporting therapy experiences, 70.8% reported negative outcomes whereas only 7.9% reported satisfaction. None of those forced into therapy (25.8%) reported positive outcomes. Preliminary analysis suggested higher satisfaction with male therapists (16.7% vs. 7.1% for female). Thematic analysis revealed barriers to therapeutic engagement: (1) \"blackpill\" ideology attributing sexual/romantic deprivation and associated mental health issues to immutable factors; (2) conspiracy theories framing therapy as designed to sedate and control; (3) view of therapy as female-biased and hostile to men; (4) practical concerns including cost, privacy fears, and hospitalization.\n\nConclusions: Incels present intervention challenges due to their fatalistic worldview, institutional distrust, and extreme misogyny. Findings suggest potential benefits of male therapists and clearly defined therapeutic goals that acknowledge but do not promise to resolve romantic concerns",

A sample of 530 adults completed the SD4 and HEXACO-100 along with an open-ended creative humor production task, and their humor responses were coded for toxic content using Detoxify, a BERT-based large language model that had been fine-tuned to detect offensive material in text. Structural equation models found that the creation of vulgar humor was significantly associated with being male, younger, and less educated. None of the six HEXACO traits significantly predicted vulgarity, but Dark Tetrad models found significant effects for sadism (more vulgarity), psychopathy (less vulgarity), and the global D factor (more vulgarity) in a bifactor model. Taken together, the findings shed light on who is more likely to use taboo comedic devices and to create jokes that violate norms of politeness.",

          "abstract": "Frustration is a universally experienced yet understudied emotional state, frequently examined in isolated, controlled laboratory environments that neglect the intricate interaction of internal and situational factors. This exploratory research extends beyond such isolated settings by investigating how individual differences, including personality traits, behavioral tendencies, and situational triggers, influence the onset, severity, and reactions to frustration. A total of 145 participants (100 women), aged between 14 and 66 years, completed the Frustration Induction Task (FIT), which was designed to elicit frustration through factors such as time constraints, disruptive notifications, ambiguous feedback, and keyboard manipulation. Based on participants' self-reported experiences of frustration, three distinct response profiles were identified: High Frustration, Mid Frustration, and Low Frustration. The findings suggest that individuals exhibiting high levels of neuroticism, emotional dysregulation, and discomfort intolerance are more predisposed to the High Frustration profile. Conversely, higher emotional intelligence and robust personal standards of perfectionism serve as protective factors against frustration. Situational triggers, particularly time pressure, notably intensify frustration responses, especially among individuals with low impulse control and low discomfort tolerance. These results provide a more comprehensive understanding of individual differences in frustration responses and emphasize the importance of developing tailored emotion regulation strategies in both clinical settings and high-stress environments.",

          "abstract": "Introduction Cervical cancer is the first cancer potentially eliminable through widespread HPV vaccination. In Italy, despite free access, vaccine coverage among adolescents remains low. Psychological factors and cognitive biases can influence vaccine decisions and contribute to vaccine hesitancy (VH). While social media offer new avenues for health communication, their effectiveness in reducing VH is uncertain. This study investigates the impact of Instagram-based communication strategies on adolescents’ HPV knowledge and VH.\n\nMethods A three-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted in 22 high school classes in Tuscany, Italy, involving 526 students. Classes were assigned to one of three Instagram accounts: a neutral control, an information-based, or a bias-aware information. After three weeks (T2), students completed a follow-up survey, followed by an in-class lesson. Surveys were administered at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2), and three-month follow-up (T3).\n\nResults The final analysis included 301 students (mean age 15.2, 74% female). At T1, VH and knowledge scores were low (mean VH = 40%; knowledge score = 27%), and 47.9% reported likely seeking information from sexual and reproductive services. No significant changes in VH or knowledge were found at T2 overall. However, in students with low information avoidance (IA), the info-based page reduced VH significantly compared to the control (-6.9%, p = 0.009). In contrast, among high-IA students, the same intervention increased VH (estimate: +8.9%, p = 0.002). Willingness to seek information increased in the info group among low-IA students (+1.639 vs. control, p = 0.034). At T3, we measured the impact of an in-person lecture on students’ HPV and HPV vaccination literacy. A significant increase of knowledge compared to T1 is observed despite the smaller sample collected.\n\nConclusion Social media campaigns alone may not effectively reduce VH in adolescents and can even backfire among high-IA individuals. Future strategies should incorporate personalized, bias-aware messaging and interactive tools to address VH and improve HPV vaccine uptake more effectively.",

          "abstract": "Many people around the world believe that to be moral, one must believe in God. However, individuals who do not believe in God also hold distinct ethical beliefs. Similar to theists, non-theists in different cultures may share overarching narratives about morality and what it is founded upon – a possibility that remains to be systematically researched. In the present study, we utilised open-ended survey data to explore what non-religious non-theists from ten countries (N = 996) described as the basis of their views on right and wrong. We furthermore investigated how different beliefs about morality clustered together. The findings point towards cross-culturally recurring non-theistic beliefs and belief clusters pertaining to 1) important moral principles and 2) non-theistic ways to view the source of morality. We furthermore discuss country-specific findings, such as the importance of ‘conscience’ for Turkish and Czech participants and ‘cultural Christianity’ in the Danish sample. Altogether, the results support research indicating that a lack of belief in God does not entail moral relativism and question views on non-theists primarily seeing morality as self-constructed. Instead, our findings point towards a more prominent role of social interaction and ‘social contract’ in non-theistic views about right and wrong. We suggest that predominant ways of measurement in moral psychology may currently engulf the diversity of non-theistic moral outlooks and communal moralities in particular. To our knowledge, the study provides the first data-driven examination of non-theists’ views on right and wrong in different cultures.",

We understood that managing diabetes could be challenging, especially dealing with painful insulin injections and strict food rules. By talking with children and young people, we sought to learn more about their needs and what mattered most to them in terms of research. \nMethods: This study was conducted by Diabetes UK in collaboration with the University of East London to understand what children and young people with type 1 diabetes need to better take care of themselves. The study involved 21 participants aged 6 to 17 from England, Wales, and Scotland. We conducted focus groups with children and young people, as well as separate proxy focus groups with parents/guardians of the youngest research participants. The parent/guardian focus groups supplemented the evidence from the children’s focus groups, with the study prioritizing the voices of children and young people, to explore the challenges they faced in managing diabetes at home, school, and during leisure activities.\nResults: Our study revealed significant issues in diabetes management across different age groups: 6–8-year-olds prioritize research for managing glucose levels at home, and educating catering assistants about diabetes; 9–11-year-olds prioritize easier-to-change pumps, and educating friends about diabetes; 12–14-year-olds focus on educating teachers, creating safe spaces for managing hypoglycaemia, and raising awareness about sports and mood fluctuations; 15–17-year-olds seek to reduce the burden of educating others about diabetes in school.\nConclusions: This study is significant for future research and practice because it provides valuable insights that will guide future work in supporting children and young people with type 1 diabetes. By understanding their needs and priorities, we can develop strategies and policies that align with their lifestyles and expectations. This, in turn, will help them better manage their condition, reduce the risk of health crises, and improve their overall well-being as they grow older with diabetes.",

Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), participants performed a vowel categorization task under a subtle lip perturbation. Classifiers trained to decode perceived phonetic categories from single-trial brain responses showed significantly reduced accuracy when tested on perturbed trials, indicating that sensorimotor representations support phonetic categorization in a state-dependent manner. Regions with highest contribution to decoding accuracy, including auditory and speech motor areas, showed the greatest perturbation-related disruption. Sensorimotor activity also revealed marked individual differences: participants clustered into two subgroups, one showing perceptual shifts congruent with the lip posture and the other showing opposite shifts. By linking neural activity patterns to perceptual outcomes, our findings demonstrate that articulatory representations engaged during speech perception contribute functionally to phonetic processing and help explain individual variability in sensitivity to articulatory inputs.",

We measured the competition rates of participants in each condition of the prisoner’s dilemma games and their performance on social cognition (hostile attribution bias and empathy) and psychological measures [depression, (social) anxiety, impulsivity, interpersonal difficulties]. We assessed their relapse 6-months post detoxification.\nResults: Patients with SAUD displayed a competitive bias during the games (resulting in higher outcomes) and a less efficient adaptation to their opponent’s strategy. Patient and control groups were equally sensitive to the type of opponent (computer vs. human beings). We observed no link between the competitive bias of patients with SAUD and their social cognition difficulties. Critically, we observed that patients’ competitive bias was positively linked with relapse rates at six months follow-up. \nConclusions: SAUD is characterized by a competitive bias during social decision-making.",

Sixty-six participants underwent a virtual reality FBI paradigm with synchronous/asynchronous visuo-tactile stimulation after being instructed to interpret the virtual body as either integrated with (integration condition) or separate from (separation condition) their physical body. Both groups received the fundamental instruction to “consider the virtual body as your own body.” Contrary to our hypothesis, no significant group × synchrony interaction emerged for either skin conductance responses or questionnaire measures, although exploratory analyses suggested potential group-specific patterns warranting future investigation. These findings suggest that fundamental ownership attributions dominate over conceptual distinctions, and that the precision of sensory evidence may outweigh subtle top-down modulations in body ownership, consistent with hierarchical predictive coding accounts of embodiment.",

          "abstract": "The rapid advancements of generative AI (GenAI) technologies have brought the issue of data manipulation to a whole new level. Now individuals can easily create highly realistic fabricated media, including videos, audio, and images, that are increasingly difficult to detect. These developments raise broad societal concerns, particularly in legal contexts, where authenticity of evidence is central to ensuring fairness. This review links documented legal cases to psychological research on memory distortion and false confessions to explore how AI-generated evidence affects individuals’ perception and sense of self and the consequences in a legal context. Decades of research have shown that memory’s vulnerability to suggestion, especially highlighting the power of personalized misinformation. Even in the pre-AI era, studies have shown how false memories have been induced using suggestion and simple media manipulations and how these have led to false confessions. GenAI adds another level of concern, yet no research directly examines its potential to distort memory and to elicit false confessions. This paper identifies urgent questions: How does AI-generated evidence impact memory? How can individuals ensure authenticity of the evidence confronting them? And how can legal systems prepare for the erosion of trust brought upon by this uncertainty? Proposed solutions like watermarking and implementation of authenticity protocols offer partial relief; however, the rapid advancements make sure that no definitive safeguards can be implemented. Understanding how GenAI interacts with our memory vulnerabilities is critical not only for legal psychology but for safeguarding the integrity of justice in today’s digitally mediated society.\n\nKeywords: Generative AI, deepfakes, memory distortion, legal psychology, false confessions, trust in evidence",

          "abstract": "Background:\nReading comprehension is critical for academic success, yet many children with persistent decoding difficulties struggle to achieve it. Although decoding typically becomes less constraining as reading develops, struggling readers may continue to face a decoding bottleneck into later primary years. Few randomised controlled trials have tested whether intervention-induced decoding gains translate into longer-term comprehension improvements. This study examined whether a multi-component literacy intervention can produce immediate and sustained benefits, and whether decoding gains mediate later comprehension outcomes.\nMethods:\nIn a randomised controlled trial, 285 English-speaking children aged 7–9 years with reading difficulties were assigned to a waitlist control group or the Research Informed Literacy with Language (RILL) intervention—a structured, multi-component programme targeting decoding and language comprehension. Literacy outcomes were assessed at baseline (t1), post-intervention (t2), and at four-month follow-up (t3). The trial was pre-registered (ISRCTN18940975).\nResults:\nChildren receiving RILL showed significantly greater gains in decoding (d = .19, p &lt; .001) and reading comprehension (d = .23, p = .011) immediately post-intervention. These effects were sustained four months later, with continued advantages for decoding (d = .17, p = .004) and comprehension (d = .25, p = .010). Notably, comprehension gains were stronger at follow-up than at post-test. Mediation analyses indicated a significant indirect effect of the intervention on comprehension at t3 via decoding at t2 (y-standardised indirect β = ..19, 95% CI [.13, .25], p &lt; .001); the direct effect was not significant (y-standardised β = .01, 95% CI [-.20, .20]).\nConclusions:\nThis is the first trial to show, in older struggling readers, that intervention-induced decoding gains mediate lasting improvements in reading comprehension. The findings highlight the persistence of decoding constraints in later primary years and show that strengthening word-level reading skills can produce enduring comprehension benefits.",

After learning object categories, participants were assessed on categorisation of learned and novel objects across four cue conditions: shape-only, shape-visual motion, shape-tactile motion, and shape-visual and tactile motion. We also assessed if accuracy was influenced by blocked versus interleaved cue-conditions at test. In Experiment 1, we found more accurate categorisation and generalisation when all cues were available at test. In Experiment 2 we replicated this effect even when the reliability of the shape-only cue for predicting category membership was reduced. In Experiment 3, we found that the absence of motion cues during learning removed the benefit of motion cues at test. Overall, our findings suggest that multisensory motion cues benefit the formation of novel object categories and allow for better generalisation. The results have implications for our understanding of the underlying dynamic and multisensory nature of object categories and the predictive role of multisensory features on category formation.",

While cash-outs have been suggested to intensify problematic gambling behaviors, empirical studies to date have been correlational, leaving a gap in determining causal evidence. In the present Registered Report, the proposed study will investigate the direct impact of the perceived availability of cash-out feature on various facets of gambling behavior in an online experiment. Hungarian residents with online gambling history will be informed that they will have the chance to gamble real money on sports events. Following random allocation, half of the participants will be told that they will have the option to cash out their bets before the outcome of the sports event is known, while the other half will not. The study will compare the proportion of participants placing bets, bet sizes, and bet risks between the two groups. Furthermore, the study will explore the differential effects of the cash-out feature on specific high-risk subgroups. The findings are likely to have significant implications for the design of online betting platforms, contribute to regulatory frameworks, and inform the design of interventions aimed at minimizing gambling-related harm.",

          "abstract": "Frustration is a universally experienced yet understudied emotional state, frequently examined in isolated, controlled laboratory environments that neglect the intricate interaction of internal and situational factors. This exploratory research extends beyond such isolated settings by investigating how individual differences, including personality traits, behavioral tendencies, and situational triggers, influence the onset, severity, and reactions to frustration. A total of 145 participants (100 women), aged between 14 and 66 years, completed the Frustration Induction Task (FIT), which was designed to elicit frustration through factors such as time constraints, disruptive notifications, ambiguous feedback, and keyboard manipulation. Based on participants' self-reported experiences of frustration, three distinct response profiles were identified: High Frustration, Mid Frustration, and Low Frustration. The findings suggest that individuals exhibiting high levels of neuroticism, emotional dysregulation, and discomfort intolerance are more predisposed to the High Frustration profile. Conversely, higher emotional intelligence and robust personal standards of perfectionism serve as protective factors against frustration. Situational triggers, particularly time pressure, notably intensify frustration responses, especially among individuals with low impulse control and low discomfort tolerance. These results provide a more comprehensive understanding of individual differences in frustration responses and emphasize the importance of developing tailored emotion regulation strategies in both clinical settings and high-stress environments.",

          "abstract": "Life events have been theorized to elicit personality trait changes. However, the empirical evidence for event-related personality development remains inconclusive. Even comprehensive reviews and meta-analyses are limited by the availability of effect sizes, the control for relevant confounders, and the way time is treated in the analyses. To overcome these limitations, we conducted a coordinated data analysis and examined event-related personality changes across seven large-scale panel studies (Ntotal = 196,256). Furthermore, we investigated corresponding event-related changes in life satisfaction and self-esteem as benchmarks for the interpretation of effect sizes. Integrating the results across panel studies, we found several consistent changes in the Big Five personality traits in response to life events. For example, new employment predicted increases in conscientiousness and emotional stability, whereas marriage predicted a decrease in openness. However, event-related changes in the Big Five personality traits were small (average bstd = 0.06), with effect sizes similar to those of event-related changes in self-esteem but smaller than corresponding changes in life satisfaction. Building on these findings, future research should focus on the life events with replicable effects on personality development and examine how these life events lead to personality changes.",

However, the relevance of this phenomenon to clinical conditions, such as depression and eating disorders, is understudied. Therefore, we devised a questionnaire to measure hunger-related mood dysregulation.\nMethods\nWe developed and validated the Mood, Emotions and Appetite List (MEAL) using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis in adults and adolescents in the community, and adults with a history of mental health disorder (N = 1,119). We examined the association of MEAL scores with happiness, frustration and boredom during the frustration-inducing mood drift task, in which participants wait for six minutes and rate their mood every 30 seconds.\nResults\nThe MEAL showed good psychometric properties, capturing three factors for hunger-related ‘irritability’, ‘low mood’ and ‘somatic feelings’ (RMSEA = 0.03 in community adults, 0.05 in community adolescents, 0.08 in adults with mental health disorder history). Quantitative and qualitative responses evidenced that hunger-related mood dysregulation impacts relationships, work and other activities. MEAL scores were associated with irritability, depression, anxiety and menstrual symptoms. In the mood drift task, the irritability subscale (MEAL-i) demonstrated a significant interaction with time, such that individuals with higher MEAL-i scores reported steeper decreases in happiness (B = -0.11; 95% CI: -0.16–-0.06) and steeper increases in boredom (B = 0.06; 95% CI: 0.00–0.12) and frustration (B = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.05–0.19).\nConclusions\nThe MEAL measures individual differences in hunger-related mood dysregulation, is associated with mental health, self-reported functioning, and predicts faster worsening of mood during experimentally induced frustration.",

Our findings show no effects of daily adversity on selecting content with more or less semantic affinity, but exploratory analyses reveal that daily media coping strategies differentially relate to the selection of different entertainment genres.

          "abstract": "Frustration constitutes an affective state precipitated by the obstruction of goals or the failure to meet expectations, playing a crucial role in emotional regulation and the development of maladaptive behaviors. Despite its significance, frustration remains difficult to induce and quantify in experimental paradigms due to its multifaceted nature and overlap with related emotions such as anger, helplessness, and irritation. This study introduces the Frustration Induction Task (FIT), a tablet-based paradigm designed to evoke frustration in a controlled, reproducible, and component-specific manner. Across two experiments (total N = 160), participants were randomly assigned to complete a navigation task under either frustration-inducing or control conditions. The FIT integrated multiple triggers, including time constraints, ambiguous feedback, reward omission, keyboard manipulation, and interface disruptions, based on theoretical models of frustration. Participants reported their frustration after each trial and completed a post-task assessment of component-specific frustration. In Study One, the frustration-induced group reported significantly higher levels of frustration compared to the control group. Frustration levels increased progressively across trials, supporting the cumulative frustration design of the paradigm. In Study Two, time pressure, keyboard malfunction, and negative performance feedback emerged as the strongest contributors to frustration, whereas address familiarity played a minimal role. The FIT offers a paradigm for experimentally eliciting and measuring frustration. By enabling real-time, component-specific assessment of frustration dynamics, it provides a valuable framework for future research in affective science, cognitive control, neuroscience, and emotion regulation.",

Most PCOS studies are limited to individual outcome measures or domains of function as opposed to a holistic approach (e.g., considering the range of impacts/lived experiences of those with the condition). The present study sought to address this gap via in-depth interviews with eight women who had been formally diagnosed with PCOS. Reflexive thematic analysis resulted in four themes: Symptoms of PCOS, Impact of PCOS, Diagnostic and Treatment Experiences, and Misogyny. We argue that service users are receiving inadequate information about PCOS from their clinicians due to the limited evidence base and lack of knowledge. We also highlight a need for increased awareness and acceptance of reproductive disorders more generally. Further research is needed to ensure that those with PCOS are adequately informed and supported in a holistic manner.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity. To limit its damaging impacts, billions of people must take pro-environmental actions. However, these often require effort and people avoid effort. It is vital to identify psychological interventions that increase willingness to exert effort. 3,055 people from six diverse countries completed an effort-based decision-making task (Pro-Environmental Effort Task; Bulgaria: n=404, Greece: n=85, Nigeria: n=660, Sweden: n=1090, UK: n=482, USA: n=334). Participants chose whether to exert physical effort (50-95% of their maximum) to reduce carbon emissions, after experiencing one of 11 expert crowd-sourced interventions or no intervention. We applied computational modelling to precisely quantify motivation to help the climate, compared to a closely matched non-environmental cause. We found two interventions, which reduced the psychological distance to climate change impacts or promoted climate action as patriotic and protecting participants’ way of life, had consistent positive effects on increasing effortful pro-environmental behaviours, across measures and control analyses. At the individual level, motivation to benefit the climate was associated with belief in climate change and support for pro-environmental policies. In contrast, trait apathy and effort aversion were linked with reduced motivation to benefit both the climate and food cause. Together, our results have crucial implications for promoting effortful actions that help mitigate climate change.",

          "abstract": "Emotional experience and the regulation thereof are typically studied using picture inventories or short films to induce and modify affective states. These approaches, however, lack ecological validity due to their passive and receptive nature. Recent innovations in virtual reality and mobile neurophysiological technologies have enabled researchers to study the behavioral and neural correlates of more ecologically valid emotional responses. In this preregistered study, 58 healthy participants were randomly assigned to either use cognitive reappraisal (intervention) or to immerse themselves in their senses and surroundings (control) while walking across a wooden plank suspended 80 stories above the ground in virtual reality. We measured behavioral ratings, salivary alpha amylase and cortisol levels, as well as frontal brain asymmetries, captured using mobile electroencephalography (EEG). Across both conditions, we found decisive evidence of increased subjective fear and salivary alpha amylase, a marker of sympathetic activation. However, we found no increase in cortisol levels following the task suggesting that subjective fear alone is not sufficient to trigger an HPA-axis response. In contrast to our hypotheses, the reappraisal group did not show any difference compared to the control group for neither behavioral, endocrine nor neural measures. On the one hand, our findings may suggest that reappraisal might not be a suitable strategy to regulate realistic and intensely frightening situations. On the other hand, further analyses also indicated that the control group may have also regulated their emotions due to increased mindfulness of their inner states and their environment. Future studies are needed to confirm these observations and ascertain the efficacy of cognitive reappraisal on fear in realistic settings.",

These children and their families may greatly benefit from targeted interventions that facilitate the disruption of accumulating vulnerability. To facilitate these efforts, we need empirical evidence of the underlying dynamics of adversity and health problems throughout childhood.\n\nMethods\n\nWe investigated associations between three types of childhood adversities (material deprivation, experiences of loss or threat of loss and family dynamics) and hospitalizations for mental and physical health problems across four developmental periods among 12,446 children who experienced high rates of family adversity. We used data from the Danish Life Course (DANLIFE) register-based cohort study and applied cross-lagged networks models. Hospitalizations were identified through inpatient, outpatient, and emergency hospital contacts.\n\nResults\n\nWe found clear evidence for the co-occurrence of childhood adversities and health problems across childhood, partially resulting from feedback loops and direct effects between different types of childhood adversities, and between physical and mental health problems. We also observed strong autoregressive effects across childhood adversity and health domains indicating vicious circles of reinforcing adversity. Conditional on high health problems in infancy, childhood adversity was not found to be associated with additional health problems throughout the rest of childhood. Child health problems were, however, positively associated with subsequent adversity across childhood. \n\nConclusions\n\nDynamics of childhood adversity and poor health give rise to complex reinforcing patterns of vulnerability over time. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the emergence of vulnerability resulting from childhood adversity and poor health in children, highlighting the importance of embracing the complex nature of these emergent phenomena, both in research and intervention.",

We used self-reports of mate value, mate access, hostile sexism, benevolent sexism, and belief in sexism shift from 1,604 Finnish adults. We examined associations between these self-reports by using multivariate multiple regression, controlling for political ideology, sex ratio, and whether the respondent was searching for a partner. Higher mate value was associated with more benevolent sexism in women, but not in men. Contrary to predictions, frequent mate access encounters were associated with lower benevolent sexism in women, but not in men. We did not find associations between mate value or mate access and hostile sexism or belief in sexism shift in men or women.

Developmental changes in functional connectivity between cortical and subcortical regions may refine communication within reward-related circuitry, influencing learning and decision-making. Here, we compared reinforcement learning behavior and its relationship to resting-state functional connectivity in reward-related circuits in adolescents and adults. Fifty-eight healthy participants (32 adolescents aged 13-16; 26 adults aged 30-40) completed a probabilistic two-armed bandit task and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The learning-related parameters learning rate (α) and inverse temperature (β, an index of the randomness of choices) and their relationship to functional connectivity were modeled from behavioral data using Q learning in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. In the whole sample, learning rate was associated with functional connectivity in several cortico-subcortical pathways, particularly involving the anterior cingulate cortex. Adolescents exhibited lower learning rate and inverse temperature values than adults and had a stronger association between learning rate and fronto-striatal connectivity. Adolescents also showed less tendency to stay with winning options. These findings highlight the involvement of the ACC in reward learning and indicate that behavior in a reinforcement learning context is characterized by reduced feedback-driven learning and greater exploration in adolescents compared to adults, and suggest that adolescents rely more on fronto-striatal connectivity during learning.",

We designed an interactive immersive-reality experiment, where participants—either alone or in groups of five—foraged for rewards in environments with different resource distributions. Our behavioral results revealed that groups outperformed solitary foragers and even optimal Bayesian agents in environments with sparse rewards but large differences in patch quality—precisely as predicted by our numerical simulations from both frameworks. Computational analyses showed that reinforcement-learning and drift-diffusion models generated similar behav-\nioral predictions, with both frameworks accurately reproducing participants’ behavior across conditions. However, at the cognitive level, both frameworks partly diverged in explaining the process of social information integration, overall suggesting that participants integrated the choices and payoffs of others into their personal evaluation of the environment.

Rather than being ungrammatical, children's utterances appear to be structured by temporary grammars, which optimize the distribution of information in sequences. We show how semantic networks reorganize to support learning and suggest that English provides functionally ambiguous (multipurpose) categories to aid the reorganization of semantic spaces. These findings are somewhat counterintuitive, as they suggest that not knowing the exact meaning of words can facilitate both learning and communication.",

          "abstract": "Contemporary personality disorder diagnosis parses personality functioning (PF) as a general criterion for diagnosis and personality traits as the style in which the disorder manifests. There is ongoing debate about the distinctness of PF and personality traits, but research on core differences between PF and personality traits has been limited by an over-reliance on cross-sectional data that may be insensitive to these differences. We fit a continuous time model to five factor model (FFM) personality trait facets that parsed general correlated change and change that could be accounted for by FFM domains using ten years of longitudinal data from the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality disorders Study (N = 733). We found that the general change factor was very similar to lay and expert conceptions of psychological health and explained more variance in personality disorder symptom reductions over time than trait change factors. These results support the distinction between PF and personality traits, suggest that features of PF can be identified within change processes in personality trait assessments, and highlight the importance of designs that are sensitive to theoretical differences in these concepts.",

Costs such as the time and effort associated with \ncertain behaviours are integral to everyday decision-making and can significantly shape \npeople's motivation to act. In this preregistered study, we employed a novel experimental \nparadigm to quantify how people discount effort (measured via a grip-force device) and time \n(operationalised as waiting time) for self-benefiting and pro-environmental outcomes. \nParticipants (n = 74) could earn monetary rewards for themselves (in half of the trials) and for \nreducing carbon emissions (in the other half). We observed higher willingness to incur time \nand effort costs for self-benefitting than for pro-environmental outcomes, in particular when \nthe rewards offered were higher. Moreover, computational modelling revealed rewards were \ndiscounted nonlinearly by both time and effort: effort discounting was best described by a \nparabolic function, and temporal discounting by a hyperbolic function. While climate change \nbeliefs did not significantly predict the motivation to invest time and effort into benefiting the \nenvironment, participants who were more motivated to invest time and effort for the \nenvironment also showed a greater willingness to support costly climate change mitigation \npolicies.

          "abstract": "In recent years, social media has become increasingly fragmented, as platforms evolve and new alternatives emerge. Yet most research studies a single platform—typically Twitter/X, or occasionally Facebook—leaving little known about the broader social media landscape. Here we shed new light on patterns of cross-platform variation in the high-stakes context of news sharing. We examine the relationship between user engagement and news domains’ political orientation and quality across seven platforms: Twitter/X, BlueSky, TruthSocial, Gab, GETTR, Mastodon, and LinkedIn. Using an exhaustive sampling strategy, we analyze all (over 10 million) posts containing links to news domains shared on these platforms during January 2024. We find that the news shared on platforms with more conservative user bases is significantly lower quality on average. Turning to patterns of engagement, we find—contrary to hypotheses of a consistent “right wing advantage” on social media—that the relationship between political lean and engagement is strongly heterogeneous across platforms. Conservative new posts receive more engagement on platforms where most content is conservative, and vice versa for liberal news posts,  consistent with an “echo platform” perspective. In contrast, the relationship between news quality and engagement is strikingly consistent: across all platforms examined, lower-quality news posts received higher average engagement even though higher quality news is substantially more prevalent and garners far more total engagement across posts. This pattern holds despite accounting for poster-level variation, and is observed even in the absence of ranking algorithms, suggesting user preferences – not algorithmic – bias may underlie the underperformance of higher-quality news.",

Universities worldwide are now concerned with the smart allocation of their resources to maximize the outputs in the form of community services and skilled graduates who are suitable for practice, research, and development to advance local industries. Efficiency signifies a peak level of performance that uses the least amount of inputs to achieve the highest amount of output. Academic efficiency can be external or internal. External efficiency is related to the private and social benefits derived from investment in education, while internal efficiency is concerned with achieving the institutional goals set by academic leaders, within the allocated resources. There is a growing need in higher education programs to achieve the intended program outcomes and prepare graduate professionals with marketable skills in their field of specialization.

          "abstract": "Understanding moment-to-moment therapeutic change is critical for advancing clinical science, yet existing tools rarely capture these dynamics. Dynamical systems theory offers a transtheoretical framework for modeling how therapeutic microprocesses shift and stabilize, but few methods can quantitatively link features such as stable states (“attractors”) and shifts (“transitions”) with empirical data, especially when governing equations are unknown. We introduce Temporal Mapper, a topological data analysis (TDA) method that detects these features and represents their organization as attractor transition networks. As a proof-of-concept, we apply Temporal Mapper to psychotherapy microprocess data, examining interpersonal behaviors and alliance ruptures. The method revealed that therapist warmth stabilized dyadic states within and between sessions, whereas confrontation ruptures stabilized states within sessions but diversified and destabilized them across sessions. Beyond this example, Temporal Mapper offers a generalizable approach for uncovering fine-grained dynamic patterns in psychotherapy and identifying mechanisms of change to inform more effective interventions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Emotion regulation is a transdiagnostic factor in psychopathology. However, the field is primarily dominated by research in explicit emotion regulation. Understanding of implicit emotion regulation as well as its relationship with explicit emotion regulation is limited. Here, we investigate whether explicit and implicit emotion regulation exist on a continuum of the explicitness of the emotion regulation goal at the neural level.\n\nMethod: We conducted a coordinate-based neuroimaging meta-analysis with activation likelihood estimation. We focused on neuroimaging studies that investigate explicit (i.e., reappraisal, suppression, distraction, selective attention, psychological placebo) and implicit emotion regulation strategies (i.e., extinction, affect labelling, emotional go/no-go, emotional stroop) in either healthy individuals or individuals with mood and/or anxiety disorders.\n\nResults: There were more studies of explicit emotion regulation (75 experiments, 2811 participants) than implicit emotion regulation (28 experiments, 1292 participants). Results of the neuroimaging meta-analysis revealed that explicit emotion regulation strategies recruit more frontal and temporal lobe compared to implicit emotion regulation. Implicit emotion regulation strategies recruit more subcortical and limbic areas compared to explicit emotion regulation strategies. Insula, inferior frontal gyrus and extra-nuclear in the subcortical area are responsible for both explicit and implicit emotion regulation. \n\n\nConclusion: Explicit and implicit emotion regulation are associated with different neural correlates. Explicit emotion regulation recruits more regions responsible for goal-directed behaviors while implicit emotion regulation targets regions related to emotion and affect processing, instead of goal-awareness. \n\n\nPre-registration: This study was pre-registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024505144).",

These practices now need to be carefully evaluated for safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness. We aimed to investigate key data to inform future economic evaluations in this area via a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of the Australian population.\nMethods We compared quality-of-life scores across groups using regression analysis to account for group differences. Self-reported health service use (general, mental, complementary) was compared across groups (not needed, unmet need, used service) and index-scores. Self-reported practice cost estimates were investigated across contemplative practices (e.g. meditation, yoga) for a range of cost types (e.g. classes, travel, donations). \nResults The sample included 445 meditators, 1034 other contemplative practitioners and 586 non-practitioners, with large demographic differences between groups. Unadjusted quality-of-life was significantly higher for non-practitioners compared to practitioners. Differences were maintained when demographic variables were added to the model, but not when mental health service use was included as a covariate. We estimated that 8.9% of the sample had unmet mental-health service use and that this was highest in the meditation group (13.9%) compared to the non-practitioner group (2.4%). The average cost of any contemplative practice (including meditation) was $1,281 per person. \n \nConclusions This study provides preliminary evidence on potentially suitable variables for estimating costs and effects towards conducting cost-effectiveness studies of contemplative practices. EQ-HWB-9 index scores performed well as an outcome measure in this population.",

          "abstract": "Real-world memories often include our internal thoughts and feelings, yet memory research has largely centered on experimentally controlled external stimuli. As a result, it remains underexplored how such internal experiences are preserved or transformed in naturalistic autobiographical recall, and whether they serve functional roles. To address this gap, we analyzed a large-scale dataset of autobiographical narratives in which crowdsourced participants recalled a specific memorable life event twice, several weeks apart, and rated their memories along multiple dimensions. We combined manual annotation with natural language processing to identify and analyze individual memory details, categorized as either observable external experiences or subjective internal experiences. We found that internal experiences were more prone to distortion or forgetting over time compared to external ones. However, those with higher emotional intensity and stronger semantic connections to external event\nfeatures were more likely to be retained. Memories richer in internal experiences were also judged as more important, and semantically precise reinstatement of internal experiences across recalls predicted increased importance over time. Together, these findings show that although memories of internal thoughts and feelings are relatively fragile, they nonetheless play a meaningful role in shaping the subjective significance of autobiographical memory.",

          "authors": "Michael L DeKay",
          "abstract": "People’s preferences in choices involving money, health, and other matters can often be steered toward safer or riskier options by framing the options as potential gains or potential losses. This risky-choice framing effect is well established, but its direction and magnitude depend on whether the options are described completely or incompletely and whether the descriptions are matched or mismatched in the gain and loss frames. In a recent experiment involving 18 combinations of option descriptions (nine in each frame), DeKay and Dou (2024) found that the valence or gist of the descriptions accounted for substantial variation in risk preferences, favoring categorical theories of framing over more mathematical theories. However, a residual framing effect and a framing effect in choices between completely described options contradicted the categorical theories and previous results. The effect for completely described options was especially surprising, but it was based on data from only 97 participants. The experiment reported here replicated all these effects in a large sample (N = 1,697) well-matched to U.S. Census data and with many more participants (477) making choices between completely described options. Risky-choice framing effects do stem partly from mismatched option descriptions, but a framing effect persists even when descriptions are matched and complete. The latter results expand the effect’s relevance to situations where it was thought to be absent. Among several theory specifications, a new rescaled version of the explicated valence account is the only one that explains these effects in the replication and in DeKay and Dou’s online and student samples.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive stability and flexibility are often conceived as two antagonistic modes of cognitive control. While stability supports the maintenance of a stable task focus and resistance against interference, cognitive flexibility facilitates adaptive responses to changing demands. In a pre-registered electroencephalography study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying adjustments in cognitive stability and flexibility by examining neural signatures of cognitive control adjustments. Specifically, we tested whether deliberate enhancements in cognitive stability and flexibility levels were associated with a facilitation of goal shielding and shifting, respectively. Participants completed a task-switching experiment in which they received explicit strategy instructions that aimed at promoting either cognitive stability or flexibility in a within-subjects design. We assessed mid-frontal theta power as an indicator of cognitive control recruitment and effort mobilization. Participants succeeded in adopting the instructed control states and behaviorally exhibited inverse adjustments in indicators of cognitive stability and flexibility. However, we did not find any differences in theta power in response to shielding or shifting demands between conditions. Consistent with previous studies and subjective effort ratings, more stable control states were further not associated with a generally increased recruitment of cognitive control. We thus did not find that adjustments in cognitive stability and flexibility were linked to modulations in effort or cognitive control recruitment. Potential processes that may have promoted more effective task shielding and shifting are discussed, providing directions for future research.",

          "abstract": "Every day, we face the opposing requirements to flexibly shift between goals and to shield them against distractions. Context-dependent adjustments of cognitive stability and flexibility are a prerequisite for adaptive behavior. A current debate centers on whether these two functions of cognitive control involve a tradeoff, manifesting in reciprocal performance benefits and costs, or if cognitive stability and flexibility can be regulated independently. This study aimed to test the assumption of a stability-flexibility tradeoff and investigate determinants of control regulations. We examined whether cognitive stability and flexibility can be regulated voluntarily and whether these adjustments are modulated by the task relevance of distracting information. In two task-switching paradigms with varying distractor relevance, we instructed participants to either focus on the current task or to switch flexibly between tasks in within-subject designs. Monetary rewards were contingent on how well participants succeeded in implementing these instructions. Across both experiments, participants adjusted their cognitive flexibility but not stability according to the instructions. The distractor relevance further did not moderate control adjustments. Multilevel analyses revealed no correlations between changes in task-switch costs and interference costs in both experiments, providing no evidence for the expected tradeoff between cognitive stability and flexibility. Our results provide evidence that adjustments in cognitive flexibility are partly under voluntary control. However, they do not support the notion of an inherent stability-flexibility tradeoff, at least in the task-switching paradigms we used.",

          "abstract": "Americans overestimate the extremity of differences between, and homogeneity among, the (non-political) characteristics and preferences of Republicans versus Democrats. We propose that everyday self-presentation contributes to these misperceptions: signaling motives lead people to represent themselves as more ``sorted'', i.e. as having preferences and characteristics that are closely aligned with what is perceived as typical of their party. This leads observers to have miscalibrated (and exaggerated) perceptions of differences between the groups. We present two studies testing the hypothesis that signaling motives exaggerate public expressions of partisan sortedness.  Study 1 examines how social media users' profile descriptions vary in sortedness across social media platforms using two multi-platform datasets (N=740,055; 10,224).  Study 2 (N=3,013) demonstrates a causal effect of signaling opportunities on sortedness using a pre-registered economic trust game experiment where participants write a self-description. We randomize whether this description will be shared with a co-partisan who is deciding how much to trust the participant.  Across both studies, we found that people present themselves as more sorted when returns to signaling in-party status are larger.  \nFurthermore, people perceive sortedness of fellow partisans as a signal of trustworthiness - and sortedness is indeed a signal of trustworthiness, but only in the absence of signaling motives. \nTogether, these findings shed light on how misperceptions of the extent of differences between political groups may be rooted in strategic self-presentation practices. This work has implications for disentangling performative and substantive polarization, and designing practical and effective depolarization interventions.",

Across several follow-up experiments, we unpack possible factors which limited the effectiveness of social observational learning. Overall, the results suggest that social decision rule inference (inferring a partner's decision rule from observed choices) was a key bottleneck for observational learning.

While automatic speech recognition (ASR) models offer potential solutions, current ASR systems, including OpenAI’s Whisper, were primarily trained on adult-directed speech (ADS) and have not been systematically evaluated for infant-directed speech (IDS). IDS differs from ADS in prosody, phonetics, utterance structure, and lexical patterns, posing unique challenges for ASR transcription. In this study, we benchmarked Whisper’s transcription accuracy on a dataset of naturalistic caregiver infant recordings, comparing ASR-generated transcripts to human-annotated gold-standard transcriptions. We evaluated Whisper’s performance using word error rate (WER) and accuracy, and conducted a failure analysis to identify systematic errors made by Whisper, including utterance segmentation mismatches, high error rates in short and repetitive speech and inconsistent filler word handling. Results indicated that Whisper struggles with short, contextually ambiguous utterances and fails to reliably segment IDS utterances. Based on these results and early user experience, we propose a preliminary pipeline for integrating ASR technology with human transcription workflows to enhance the efficiency of processing large-scale naturalistic speech data in developmental research.",

This capability is often attributed to a folk theory of mind, which rationally links inferences about the beliefs and desires of another person to their observed behavior through a form of inverse planning. Evidence suggests, however, that people do not consistently exercise this capability. One reason may be that theory of mind is computationally costly. Heuristic methods can circumvent some of these computations, particularly when reasoning about routine behavior. We explored the conditions under which people engage in full inference versus heuristic approximations. We found that participants selectively neglected the beliefs of other agents when inferences about these beliefs were not necessary for predicting behavior. This “belief neglect” appeared to be the default behavior; participants exhibited belief sensitivity only with training on a task where belief inference was necessary. These findings suggest that people are capable of adaptive cognitive resource allocation in social reasoning.",

Results showed the presence of labels, their iconicity and online presentation significantly affect non-linguistic cognitive processing, leading to more rapid and accurate visual recognition of newly acquired semantic categories.

          "abstract": "The production effect refers to the finding that words read aloud are remembered better than words read silently. Historically, this phenomenon has been explained with reference to distinctive features encoded at study (e.g., auditory and motor elements) being retrieved at test to discriminate between studied and unstudied items, with emphasis placed on features stemming from the act of production itself. Across two experiments, we demonstrate that even anticipation of reading a word aloud is sufficient to improve its memory over silent items. Using a recent variant of the production paradigm involving pupillometry, participants were instructed to withhold their response until a “Go” signal appeared. On “catch” trials this signal never occurred. Despite having not produced the word on a catch trial, participants nonetheless demonstrated both a behavioral (Experiments 1 and 2) and a pupillary (Experiment 2) production effect, although both were of lesser magnitude than on trials requiring actual production. For “Go” trials, the behavioral production effect was evident for both recollection and familiarity; for “catch” trials, the effect was evident only for recollection. These results support recent claims that motivational or attentional factors play a role in the emergence of the production effect, connecting this effect to a broader framework of action-oriented memory enhancement.",

Yet when used to assess psychological constructs in text, they are generally not evaluated for the types of validity, reliability, and standardization typically expected from traditional questionnaires with rating scales. This study bridges that gap by demonstrating how to evaluate the psychometric properties of text-based models, which we call Text Psychometrics.\n\nWe first review different NLP methods, compare their ability to address key challenges in psychological research such as explainability, and outline methods for evaluating them on many desirable psychometric properties. We then demonstrate this through two empirical studies. Study 1 classifies thousands of crisis counseling conversations and Reddit posts into different types of mental health issues and introduces a novel method to evaluate text models for content validity —the extent to which a test captures the full range of expressions of a construct. Study 2 examines prospective criterion validity by estimating how 49 known suicide risk factors predict imminent risk in crisis counseling conversations.\n\nIn sum, NLP studies in psychology often rely on only a few validation metrics; here, we demonstrate the need for broader psychometric evaluation and provide a practical blueprint and future directions for achieving it.",

          "abstract": "Everyday experiences can evoke positive feelings that differ among individuals and guide their behavior. Although reward processing is often linked to positive feelings, few studies have assessed the mechanisms underlying subjective positive affect. Whether varied positive experiences share brain mechanisms that are predictive of subjective positive affect is unclear. Here, we used fMRI and predictive modeling to investigate how multiple dynamic, personalized positive experiences are encoded in the brain. Neural representations and functional integration of brain areas during experiences of monetary reward, social media, music, and positive autobiographical memories were used to predict participants' affect ratings of each experience. We found that, across experiences, positive affect was encoded in multivariate neural patterns and functional coupling of distributed cortical and subcortical brain areas, as well as some canonical value-linked brain regions, like the orbitofrontal cortex. We also found that more restricted sets of brain representations and functional connections linked to sensory processing were involved in encoding type-specific subjective positive affect. Our findings suggest that positive affect may be computed and communicated throughout the brain.",

Like other forms of inference, mediation analyses are susceptible to false positive results. This is particularly true when analytic decisions are based on the data, rather than a priori hypotheses. To assess the collective evidential value of mediation analyses in marketing, we used an approach first implemented by Götz and colleagues (2021) that (1) measures the relative proximity of confidence intervals to zero (RP) and (2) aggregates a related set of RP scores into a single distribution. For our analysis, we compared the RP distribution of top marketing journals (2018-20) to simulations of low power, adequate power, and null effects. We also compared the marketing journals to real-world data from Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (JPSP) (2018-20). We found that, in terms of evidential value, mediation analyses in marketing substantially deviated from simulations of adequate power and JPSP but  were similar to simulations of low power and null effects. We propose study preregistration, corrections for multiple testing, and increased statistical power as solutions to increase evidence quality going forward.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity. To limit its damaging impacts, billions of people must take pro-environmental actions. However, these often require effort and people avoid effort. It is vital to identify psychological interventions that increase willingness to exert effort. 3,055 people from six diverse countries completed an effort-based decision-making task (Pro-Environmental Effort Task; Bulgaria: n=404, Greece: n=85, Nigeria: n=660, Sweden: n=1090, UK: n=482, USA: n=334). Participants chose whether to exert physical effort (50-95% of their maximum) to reduce carbon emissions, after experiencing one of 11 expert crowd-sourced interventions or no intervention. We applied computational modelling to precisely quantify motivation to help the climate, compared to a closely matched non-environmental cause. We found two interventions, which reduced the psychological distance to climate change impacts or promoted climate action as patriotic and protecting participants’ way of life, had consistent positive effects on increasing effortful pro-environmental behaviours, across measures and control analyses. At the individual level, motivation to benefit the climate was associated with belief in climate change and support for pro-environmental policies. In contrast, trait apathy and effort aversion were linked with reduced motivation to benefit both the climate and food cause. Together, our results have crucial implications for promoting effortful actions that help mitigate climate change.",

Traditional emotion regulation models conceptualize\nregulation as a sequential modulation of emotional responses.\nHowever, they do not fully explain how emotions are\nconstructed in a way that allows such regulation to occur.\nPredictive processing (PP) provides a mechanistic framework\nfor understanding emotion generation by proposing that the\nbrain minimizes prediction errors (PEs) to optimize perception\nand behavior. Yet, standard PP accounts reduce valence to PE\nminimization, failing to explain how PEs can generate different\nsubjective feelings. To address these limitations, we propose a\nvalence-focused model of emotion regulation that integrates\npredictive processing with self-referential cognition. We\nincorporate emotional valence as interpretative processes of\nthe self-model, which assigns emotional significance based on\ngoals, values, and autobiographical context. This model\nbridges the gap between emotion generation and regulation,\nhighlighting the dynamic interplay between prediction errors,\nsubjective valuation, and self-referential processes.

          "abstract": "Matthias Mahlmann’s Mind and Rights (M&amp;R) argues that the mentalist theory of moral cognition—premised on an approach to the mind most closely associated with generative linguistics—is the appropriate lens through which to understand moral judgment’s roots in the mind. Specifically, he argues that individuals possess an inborn moral faculty responsible for the principled generation of moral intuitions. These moral intuitions, once sufficiently abstracted, generalized, and universalized by individuals, gave rise to the idea of human rights embodied in such conventions as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I am sympathetic to this argument. I thus take my comments on M&amp;R as an opportunity to preempt topical challenges to the mentalist theory arising in statistical machine learning. I make clear the foundations of mentalism (generativism) in language and morality. These foundations are used to argue against the use of computational models as theories of human cognition and to limit the scope of models as proxies for theories. Focuses include the format of the input to models, the sequence of learning trajectories, the constraints on learning, and the means of data collection. These arguments are tied back into M&amp;R’s core themes, in particular concerning the necessity of a rich descriptive account of morality and the theory-dependence of data-interpretation.",

          "abstract": "Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) students often lag behind their hearing peers in STEM classes. This delay maybe caused by a variety of factors, including delayed access to language, and a lack of STEM learning resources available in American Sign Language (ASL). Current efforts to create STEM resources in ASL either emphasize connections to English using strategies like fingerspelling, or emphasize connections to concepts through signs that use visuospatial elements to depict the idea. Past research suggests that hearing students show improved learning when using gestures that clearly depict and embody STEM concepts. Our research investigated whether signed lessons that emphasized connections to English, or visuospatial concepts, would lead to increased learning and more embodied understanding of STEM topics. In Study 1, we developed and validated pairs of video lessons for four topics, using iterative feedback to create equally clear videos in two distinct signing styles: English-motivated (EM) and Concept-motivated (CM). In Study 2, we used these video lessons to compare within-participant learning from the two signing styles. Our results showed participants’ scores increased from pre- to post-test, indicating learning, but there were no differences based on signing style. However, when we examined participants’ signed summaries, we found that production of more CM signs was related to higher post-test scores, whereas the production of more EM signs was not. This result suggests the benefits from embodied learning occur when the signs are closely linked to the concept and that those benefits are maximized when learners produce the signs themselves.",

We find that people resolve this conflict with ‘value pluralism,’ preferring a balance of life pursuits across several value domains, where aesthetic pursuits are viewed as affording freedom from convention. We then adapt a personal change paradigm from prior work and develop a novel paradigm to examine whether people’s intuitions about the true self also reveal that a broader set of values—not just moral ones—inform judgments of the true self. We find no differences in true self judgments following the loss of an aesthetic versus moral quality. However, when directly comparing life paths, the pursuit of aesthetic excellence is sometimes viewed as offering greater access to one’s true self compared with moral excellence, in part because aesthetic pursuits are seen as less rule bound.

Next, a wide range of research literatures investigating information disorders guided the selection of risk factors to include in a risk-based framework (e.g., target, actor, content, form, manner of distribution, consequences). Moving from the abstract to the concrete, the criteria and risk factors were examined with reference to current real-world examples of information disorders drawn from a variety of setting (e.g., academic research, advertising campaigns, cyberattacks, peer-to-peer corporate transactions, public weather warnings). One of the main challenges exposed through this process was evidencing impact (tangible losses, intangible losses). This, and other limitations that were revealed through real cases are discussed in the concluding section which stress the need for an incident database of information disorders. Having a shared resource of real-world cases could better inform the development of a risk assessment methodology, as well as advancing theory development and closing some evidence gaps through future empirical research.",

Similar to theists, non-theists in different cultures may share overarching narratives about morality and what it is founded upon – a possibility that remains to be systematically researched. In the present study, we utilised open-ended survey data to explore what non-religious non-theists from ten countries (N = 996) described as the basis of their views on right and wrong. We furthermore investigated how different beliefs about morality clustered together. The findings point towards cross-culturally recurring non-theistic beliefs and belief clusters pertaining to 1) important moral principles and 2) non-theistic ways to view the source of morality. We furthermore discuss country-specific findings, such as the importance of ‘conscience’ for Turkish and Czech participants and ‘cultural Christianity’ in the Danish sample. Altogether, the results support research indicating that a lack of belief in God does not entail moral relativism and question views on non-theists primarily seeing morality as self-constructed. Instead, our findings point towards a more prominent role of social interaction and ‘social contract’ in non-theistic views about right and wrong. We suggest that predominant ways of measurement in moral psychology may currently engulf the diversity of non-theistic moral outlooks and communal moralities in particular. To our knowledge, the study provides the first data-driven examination of non-theists’ views on right and wrong in different cultures.",

In the correlational study, moral anti-realism showed a positive correlation with moral leniency, whereas no relationship was found between leniency and moral relativism. In the experimental study, we replicated the finding of a signifi-cant positive correlation between anti‑realism and moral leniency and again observed no signif-icant correlation between relativism and leniency. Our meta‑ethical framing manipulation pro-vided no evidence of a causal link between anti‑realism and moral leniency. Another finding was that CRT scores were unrelated to moral leniency in both studies.

Specifically, we discuss a) how estimates of PAT efficacy are confounded under functional unblinding and b) uncertainty surrounding whether subjective or neurobiological effects are causal therapeutic MOAs of PATs. We then review methodological solutions to address these challenges.\n\nRecent Findings: Several novel methodologies have been discussed in the literature. For testing PAT efficacy under functional unblinding, potential solutions include improved active placebo conditions, expectancy-focused recruitment and consent procedures, better measurement of expectancies and blinding, and more rigorous statistical modeling. For testing whether subjective effects are causal MOAs in PATs, strategies that disentangle the subjective and neurobiological effects of psychedelics are needed. Potential methods include administering psychedelics under general anesthesia, developing non-psychoactive psychedelic analogues, leveraging Mendelian randomization, and studying psychedelic microdosing. Participant safety and ethical considerations are critical for many of these strategies. Ultimately, combining multiple innovative methods may offer the most robust insights. \n\nSummary: Future empirical efforts to develop these strategies will be crucial for advancing our limited understanding of whether and how PATs achieve clinical benefits in psychiatry.",

          "abstract": "It is commonly assumed that people can use advance cues to proactively prepare for conflict from distracting stimulus features, yet empirical findings remain inconsistent. We hypothesized that that nature of stimulus-response (SR) mappings may be a key determinant of cue effectiveness, as vocal Stroop tasks (with non-arbitrary color-naming responses) have shown reliable cue benefits while manual Stroop tasks (with arbitrary key-press responses) typically have not. Across five experiments, we tested this hypothesis by using a spatial Stroop task with non-arbitrary SR mappings, where participants responded to the direction of arrow stimuli using spatially corresponding keys, while trying to ignore the spatially congruent or incongruent location of the stimuli. Despite robust congruency effects and optimal preparation conditions (100% valid cues, 2000ms preparation time), we observed no cue benefits in four experiments. Only when task difficulty was increased substantially (50ms stimulus presentation, Experiment 4) did cue benefits emerge, but exclusively for congruent trials. These findings document that non-arbitrary SR mappings are not a sufficient condition for ensuring cue-based engagement of proactive control, and suggest that cost-benefit calculations about control exertion may be a more promising candidate factor.",

          "abstract": "The present research examines how intersecting social categories shape first impressions of competence, focusing on Black women. Across seven online studies (total N = [884]), we investigated whether competence judgments toward Black women reflect additive effects of race and gender stereotypes or stem from a distinct intersectional stereotype. Across studies, we consistently found an intersectional pattern of competence judgments: Participants rated Black men and White women as more competent than White men, but this was less true for Black women. This pattern was modulated by individual differences in bias control—specifically, motivation and executive function (Studies 5–7). While internal motivation to control prejudice predicted pro-minority responses, this effect was insufficient to produce an overall response tendency favoring Black women equally to White women and Black men. A meta-analysis of Studies 5–7 further revealed that cognitive control efficiency (assessed by a Stroop task) significantly predicted competence ratings for Black women only, suggesting that applying pro-minority control for Black women is more difficult compared to their constituent groups. In study 7, emphasizing race over gender did not restore pro-Black bias toward Black women, further supporting intersectional models that posit emergent or unique stereotypes. These findings challenge additive models of stereotyping, emphasizing the distinct psychological representation of intersectional targets. They also underscore the difficulty of regulating stereotypes for multiply marginalized individuals. Together, these results offer insight into the interplay between social categorization, motivation, and executive control in real-world impression formation.",

Concern about demand effects is pervasive in psychology. Experimenter demand may be especially acute in studies relying on experienced participants recruited online (e.g., via Prolific), who may readily guess hypotheses, or using common paradigms (e.g., vignette studies and interventions) where study goals are transparent. We conducted three preregistered experiments (N = 2,254) examining whether explicit demand cues influence online participants’ behavior across three paradigms commonly used in psychology: a dictator game, replicating prior work on demand effects (Experiment 1); a moral dilemma vignette (Experiment 2); and an intervention on group attitudes (Experiment 3). We randomly assigned participants on Prolific to receive information about the study’s hypothesis or to a no-information control. As expected, we find that receiving such information significantly shifts participants’ beliefs about the study’s hypothesis, creating an experimenter demand. Yet we find no evidence that learning any study’s hypothesis alters participants’ behavior, judgments, or attitudes, suggesting that demand effects may be elusive in online samples. These findings offer important insights for the design and interpretation of modern psychology experiments.",

What we define as the observed residual correlation(ORC) matrix can give insight as to whether, when a given indicator is above the indicator-average scores across all indicators for that individual, what other indicators might be anticipated to be above that individual’s average score as well. What we define as the relative excess correlation(REC) matrix, when reported, can give insight,for each pair of indicators, whether the strength of that particular correlation is above or below what might have been anticipated based on the correlation of each of those two indicators with all of the others.The ORC and REC matrices will, generally,have numerous negative entries even if all of the raw correlations between each pair of indicators are positive. We discuss the relation between these correlation matrices,their analogues for covariances, along with the interpretation of the correlations they reportand the insights they can provide in understanding the relation of indicators with one another.The analogue of the REC matrix for covariances has the attractive property that its entries have an expected value of zero under a classical test theory model.

          "abstract": "Individual learners often show a tendency to engage in self-reinforcing avoidance, a pattern referred to as a learning trap.  Across five experiments, we investigated the extent to which previously trapped learners can escape via social observational learning. While social observational learning did help a significant number of trapped learners escape, the majority of trapped learners remained trapped even after observing a partner demonstrate an optimal decision rule. Across several follow-up experiments, we unpack possible factors which limited the effectiveness of social observational learning. Overall, the results suggest that social decision rule inference (inferring a partner's decision rule from observed choices) was a key bottleneck for observational learning. Simulations show that these results were unanticipated by a leading model of social reward learning, and highlight a central role for inference in social learning.",

          "abstract": "Communication with artificial agents (e.g., animated characters in virtual reality, social robots) is becoming increasingly common. Understanding how to design these agents&apos; behaviours to best support social interactions is therefore essential. One key communicative behaviour that supports human-human interactions is eye gaze, which can signal an agent&apos;s focus of attention, goals, and intentions to interact. Previous research has demonstrated that beliefs about whether an agent is human- or artificially controlled influence the perceived significance of gaze at subjective, behavioural, and neurophysiological levels. The present study specifically examined how these beliefs shape the evaluation of gaze dynamics as signals of an agent&apos;s communicative intent---an essential process for recognising and responding to communication opportunities. Participants (n = 160) completed a semi-interactive online task with a virtual agent that displayed dynamic gaze sequences. In each trial, we manipulated whether eye contact was established and whether the agent looked at the same object twice. Participants decided whether the agent was communicating a request for assistance to access an object or privately inspecting it. Across two task blocks, we also manipulated whether participants believed the agent was human- or AI-controlled. We found that believing the agent to be human-controlled increased perceived communicativeness when gaze cues were ambiguous, but this effect was attenuated in the second block of the experiment. This pattern may reflect a learned adjustment specific to the experimental setup that involved relatively consistent agent behaviour. Nevertheless, subjective ratings indicated a preference for human- over AI-modelled data. Our findings provide insights into the complexities of gaze-based communication and highlight the role of user expectations in shaping interactions with artificial agents.",

          "abstract": "Children’s well-being is partly shaped by the neighborhoods in which they grow up. While past research has focused predominantly on deficits in disadvantaged neighborhoods, this systematic review synthesizes evidence on neighborhood resources that positively influence children’s well-being, adopting a strengths-based, interdisciplinary perspective. Drawing on 32 empirical studies across disciplines including psychology, sociology, health, and urban planning, this review explores how social, physical, and institutional neighborhood resources support children aged 6–12 years. Findings reveal that social cohesion, perceived safety, peer relationships, and adult support enhance emotional and social well-being. Physical resources such as parks, green spaces, and walkable infrastructure foster physical activity and life satisfaction, while institutional supports, including libraries, after-school programs, and community centers, contribute to subjective well-being and academic engagement. The review highlights the importance of context: effects vary by age, gender, socioeconomic background, and cultural setting. Mediators such as lower parenting stress, neighborhood satisfaction, and family resilience elucidate the mechanisms through which neighborhood resources affect well-being. Notably, participatory and qualitative research underscores children’s own perspectives and agency, revealing valued but often overlooked informal neighborhood features. This review calls for equity-oriented, transdisciplinary approaches that integrate children's voices and foster neighborhood environments as active supports for well-being and development.",

In Study 1, across three samples, we explored correlational relationships between primals and attitudes toward the arts and arts engagement behavior, finding that key primal world beliefs were consistently linked with the arts items. In Study 2, we conducted a five-week long visual art intervention experiment to examine potential changes in primals based on psychoeducational priming for certain methods of engaging with the art (i.e., focusing on art technique, social connections, or perspective taking). Although the experimental conditions did not differentially change primals, Good world belief increased and Hierarchical decreased. Further, key individual differences (i.e., openness to experience, aesthetic appreciation) predicted who was more likely to exhibit changes in primals following an art intervention. These studies provide initial evidence of the relevance of the arts in the study of primal world beliefs and provide suggestions for future work on this topic, including practical ways for changing primal world beliefs via arts engagement.",

However, when successfully resolved, it can also stimulate cognitive flexibility and adaptation. This raises a question: Can cognitive conflict positively influence subsequent cognitive processes and human behaviour, or is it inherently deleterious? We designed three independent experiments to investigate behavioural changes after congruent and incongruent Stroop items in speeded motor reactions, response inhibition and implicit memory retrieval. Results revealed that cognitive conflict had a beneficial impact selectively on response inhibition, while no impact was observed on speeded responses or memory. Our studies highlight the positive consequences of cognitive conflict in boosting human cognition and behaviour, beyond the classic conflict adaptation, but only when both tasks involve conflict.",

The primary outcome was perceived stress; secondary outcomes included anxiety, depression, sleep, well-being, and life satisfaction; moderators were treatment expectancy (TE) and general self-efficacy (GSE). \nResults: Both OLP arms reduced perceived stress vs. waitlist; effects maintained at follow-up.

We examined this claim by comparing the acceptability of clitic doubling in three different speaker groups: monolingual and heritage speakers of European Spanish, and Rioplatense Spanish monolinguals. Accusative clitic doubling is grammaticalized in Rioplatense but not in European Spanish, consistent with Rioplatense Spanish being a more diachronically innovative variety. If heritage speakers mirror diachronic change, they may perform more similarly to Rioplatense than European monolinguals. The results of an acceptability judgement task showed that heritage speakers had robust knowledge of clitics but did not show evidence of progressive behavior with accusative clitic doubling. We propose that grammatical innovation may crucially depend on the demographic characteristics of heritage speakers, and on the grammatical properties of the phenomenon tested.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Posting results to clinical trial registers is encouraged and even mandatory for certain trials. This study assessed the feasibility of using structured results data from ClinicalTrials.gov for meta-analyses on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) using two exemplary approaches. \n\nMethods: In study one, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov for studies employing CBT for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and extracted posted results. We evaluated whether the data were sufficient for running a meta-analysis. In study two, we selected a published meta-analysis on digital interventions for depression, extracted all registrations of the primary sources, and assessed if the meta-analysis could be reproduced using posted results.\n\nResults: For study one, we identified 179 completed studies on CBT for MDD from ClinicalTrials.gov. 16 of 179 studies had posted results and 15 had reported depression outcomes, using various psychological scales, such as the BDI-II. This low number of posted results and the heterogeneity of reported scales made running a meta-analysis infeasible. In study two, using 83 primary sources of a published meta-analysis, we obtained 59 registrations. Only three studies had  posted results, all to ClinicalTrials.gov. Again, this made running or reproducing the meta-analysis infeasible.\n\nConclusion: The potential for clinical trial registries to support meta-analyses is substantial, yet few studies on psychotherapy post their results. Core results of clinical trials should be openly available in a timely manner and in a structured format. Currently, it seems that the posting of results data is so uncommon that running meta-analyses using structured results data from trial registries is practically impossible.",

          "abstract": "Although fasting—abstaining from food for several hours to days—is generally considered safe and potentially beneficial for long-term health, concerns persist about its acute effects on cognitive function. Given the importance of sustaining adequate levels of cognitive performance for professional and personal activities, this potential side effect warrants careful examination. Here, we synthesize evidence from experimental studies comparing cognitive performance between fasted and satiated healthy adults using standardized psychological tasks. Analyzing 222 effect sizes across 3,484 participants (median fasting duration: 12 hours), our hierarchical random-effects model revealed no meaningful difference between fasted and satiated participants (g = 0.02, 95% CrI = [-0.05, 0.10]), with low between-study heterogeneity (τ = 0.17). Notably, we observed modest reductions in cognitive performance for longer fasting intervals, and for younger (vs. older) participants during fasts. Differences across cognitive domains (e.g., attention and inhibitory control) were negligible. These findings suggest that cognitive performance remains remarkably stable during short-term fasting, supporting the feasibility of fasting practices while highlighting nuanced considerations for implementation in health interventions.",

While previous research has examined family characteristics from either the patient’s or relative’s perspective, this study systematically compares patient-family dyads using genogram analysis and attributional bias assessment. We investigated the relationship between symptom severity, attributional biases, and perceptions of emotional relationships and risk behaviors (ERRB) from both perspectives. Six female patients with BPD receiving outpatient treatment in Brazil and six family members participated. Data were collected remotely and included a BPD symptom measure, an attributional bias task, and semi-structured interviews for genogram construction exploring family ERRB. Patients showed higher intentionality scores (p = 0.0357) and more reports of physical abuse (p = 0.0235), whereas family members reported more distant/poor relationships (p = 0.0198). Categorical symptom severity correlated with suspected alcohol and drug use (p = 0.0117), and personalization bias predicted continuous symptom severity (β = 0.16, p = 0.0283). Qualitative analysis identified significant relationships within each dyad and the family members involved. These findings highlight how attributional biases and ERRB shape BPD symptoms and suggest that integrating family narratives with cognitive assessments enriches clinical understanding of underlying mechanisms.",

Behavioral science, and environmental psychology in particular, is thus well positioned to contribute knowledge to guide impactful climate action.

Formalizing theories (i.e. expressing them in the precise language of mathematics or computer code) offers many benefits to the field: it increases conceptual clarity; advances cumulative science; allows integration with other disciplines; and guides future research. Theory formalization is especially important to give substance to thinking about complex systems, where it can help evaluate the effects of candidate interventions. We illustrate how environmental psychologists can start incorporating theory formalization in their work.",

We argue that these concepts are identical  both conceptually and mechanistically, despite much VR research defining presence as something which much necessarily take place in VR. We then introduce specific instances of converging evidence between the fields, suggesting that presence and reality are likely to be constituted by the same integrative theoretical models, psychophysical mechanisms and neural architecture. Evidence from neuroimaging supports this claim, revealing overlapping brain regions involved in both presence and reality perception. This reconceptualization of VR presence as reality has implications  for research on consciousness, psychiatric disorders involving reality perception, and the use of virtual reality as a tool for studying and modifying perceptual experience. Future research should directly compare presence and reality mechanisms to explore their functional and neural equivalence, potentially redefining how we study consciousness and perception.",

          "authors": "Rotem Avital-Cohen; Nurit Gronau",
          "abstract": "Studies of visual long-term memory (VLTM) increasingly focus on how object features are stored and interrelated, with object-based accounts proposing integrated representations and feature-based views emphasizing independent feature storage and retrieval. More recent hybrid models suggest graded levels of interdependency, yet the role of semantic meaning in shaping these dependencies has remained underexplored. The present study advances a graded perspective by examining how semantic content, manipulated at the individual feature level, modulates relations among visual details. Specifically, we investigated whether color, when meaningful to an object’s identity, enhances memory for arbitrary, surface-level properties such as location or size. A preliminary survey established which object-color pairings were perceived as semantically meaningful versus meaningless. Participants showed superior memory for meaningful colors (Experiment 1a), regardless of verbal suppression (Experiment 1b), validating our manipulation. We then used conditional dependency analyses to assess whether memory for location (Experiment 2a) or size (Experiment 2b) was contingent on memory for color. Across both immediate and delayed tests, we found significant feature interdependency in both color conditions, but critically, dependency was greater when color was meaningful (although only in the delayed test for size). These findings support continuous accounts of VLTM, showing that memory representations are neither wholly integrated nor fully fragmented. Instead, semantic information strengthens both memory for individual features and their binding to otherwise arbitrary details. By manipulating semantic value at the feature level, our results demonstrate how conceptual meaning shapes the coherence of VLTM representations, providing new evidence for graded models of object memory.",

Most research has been conducted in contexts with clear societal and heritage languages, leaving open questions about language mixing in environments with two societal languages. Montreal provides a unique opportunity to examine this question, as both French and English hold societal status, while many families also maintain heritage languages. Using archival data from 398 bilingual children (7–34 months), we looked at French-English bilinguals (representing societal bilingualism) and heritage-language bilinguals within the same sociolinguistic environment. We assessed the prevalence, predictors, and motivations of parental language mixing, and its relationship with vocabulary development. Results revealed that mixing was less frequent among French-English bilinguals compared to heritage-language bilinguals in the same city. The direction of mixing differed between groups: French-English bilinguals mixed based on language dominance, while heritage-language bilinguals mixed based on societal language status. Primary motivations included uncertainty about word meanings, lack of suitable translations, and teaching new words. Mixing showed minimal associations with vocabulary size across participants. These findings suggest that parental mixing practices reflect adaptive strategies that vary by sociolinguistic context rather than detrimental influences on early language acquisition.",

Interventions for cannabis use problems could improve through personalization with ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and derived personalized feedback including idiographic networks. To study preliminary efficacy and feasibility, this pilot preclinical randomized controlled trial compared a short version of treatment as usual (TAU) to the same with the add-on of EMA and personalized feedback.\nDesign. We conducted a pilot parallel two-arm randomized controlled trial.\nSetting. Data were collected at the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands (March to November 2023).\nParticipants. We included participants aged 18-30, with good English proficiency, owning smartphones, using cannabis flower at least weekly, and wanting help to stop or diminish use. Current treatment for or diagnosis of a substance use or psychotic disorder were exclusion criteria. We recruited through flyers, social media, peer-to-peer recruitment, and the University of Amsterdam lab. We used block randomization stratified by gender; participants were blind to condition.\nIntervention. Both groups received TAU, additionally, the experimental group received EMA and personalized feedback (TAU+).\nMeasurements. Main outcomes were self-reported cannabis use and cannabis use disorder (CUD) DSM-5 symptoms. Secondary outcomes were mental health variables. Predictors were time, condition, and their interaction. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with TAU+ participants and practitioners giving the intervention and analyzed with thematic analysis.\nFindings. 90 participants were screened, 76 were randomized, 13 per group were included (target sample size), other randomized participants either declined participation/had to be excluded or were in the waiting list. Two experimental and one control participants dropped out (23 participants included in the analyses). Average cannabis grams smoked per day, days smoking cannabis, and CUD symptoms decreased in both groups (p &lt; .001). However, only TAU+ participants maintained the change for the three main outcome measures at three-months follow-up (p = .038, .035, .056 respectively). Both interventions diminished depression, stress, and negative emotions. No adverse events occurred. Participants reported high perceived usefulness, ease of use and motivation regarding the personalized feedback, but some difficulties and negative emotions in answering EMA. Practitioners’ interview results suggested the need to simplify the tool for practitioners and give more training on communicating feedback. \nConclusions. Adding personalized EMA and feedback to TAU seems feasible and may reduce relapse rates in problematic cannabis use compared to TAU alone. A larger trial is needed to support these results.",

          "authors": "Jill de Ron; Donald Robinaugh; Denny Borsboom; Olga Perski",
          "abstract": "Psychological systems are complex, exhibiting nonlinear behavior, emergence, adaptation, and feedback loops. To better capture this complexity, researchers are increasingly using mechanistic computational models (i.e., computer code designed to represent explanatory principles or rules of a target system from which data can be simulated). Despite this growing interest, there is little guidance on how to most effectively develop and use computational models in psychological research. Other scientific disciplines, such as ecology and chemistry, have used computational modeling extensively for decades and may offer valuable insights from which psychologists can learn. This scoping review synthesizes methodological steps used in developing and evaluating computational models across disciplines, spanning physical and biopsychosocial phenomena. We identified 53 computational modeling roadmaps and conducted a narrative synthesis with frequency analyses. The narrative synthesis is organized according to three research questions: i) what is the general purpose of computational modeling?; ii) what are the proposed modeling steps?; iii) how should researchers move through the modeling steps? For each of these research questions, we also examined whether roadmaps aimed at modeling physical phenomena differ from those that aim at modeling biopsychosocial phenomena. Our narrative synthesis identifies critical gaps in the existing modeling roadmaps and offers a foundation for developing more comprehensive how-to guides for psychologists seeking to integrate computational modeling into their research.",

          "abstract": "Short-term isolation studies indicate that social isolation increases sensitivity to social rewards, yet ethical constraints limit the translation of this finding to prolonged isolation in humans. To address this, we investigated social reward processing during prolonged isolation by modelling Twitter activity during COVID-19, when online spaces substituted for in-person contact. By fitting computational models to US Twitter users (n=535 and n=553,945 tweets), we found that social media posting was driven by both reinforcement learning (receiving more ‘likes’ decreased time between posts) and habitual processes (time between posts was influenced by previous behaviour). During prolonged social isolation, users were more sensitive to social media social rewards: ‘likes’ more strongly influenced the decision to post more or less frequently. These findings provide the first large-scale study of social reward processing during prolonged isolation, using ecologically valid data and more representative samples to translate principles of social reward processing into human prolonged isolation.",

          "abstract": "Children learn to represent the world around them in meaningful categories that allow them to generalize past experiences. Understanding how these categorical representations develop is fundamental to cognitive science. However, capturing the structure of human conceptual knowledge is a challenging experimental task. The most prominent approach, Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), usually requires participants to produce many similarity judgments, leading to long experiments. Moreover, the representations found by MDS are limited to the fixed set of experimental stimuli and have to be reconstructed for every new item. In contrast, we present a more flexible machine-learning method that can generalize to novel stimuli. This method uses a child-friendly task that allows researchers to uncover the development of categories with fewer participant judgments. We evaluate our approach on simulated data and find that it can accurately reveal representations even when trained on data generated by groups that categorize differently. We then analyze data from the World Color Survey and find that we can recover language-specific color organization when aggregating languages that only share the same number of basic color terms. Finally, we use the method in a developmental experiment and find age-dependent differences in how complex fruit stimuli are organized. These differences were consistent with participants' reasoning and additional experimental measures. Our results suggest that our approach is applicable in psychological tasks and opens the possibility of examining children's developing psychological spaces in new detail.",

          "authors": "Jianghao Liu",
          "abstract": "Subjective imagery refers to one’s quasi-perceptual experience in the absence of direct external input. Yet around 4% of individuals with “aphantasia” report an inability to voluntarily generate such experiences. This phenomenon provides a natural experiment that challenges current theories of imagery, which typically assume that reactivation of the visual cortex in imagery generation is sufficient for imagery experience. In fact, neuroimaging evidence shows that aphantasic individuals can reactivate visual cortex normally during imagery tasks, indicating that additional, as-yet-unspecified, processes are required for subjective experience to emerge. \nIn this theory paper, I propose an attention-based model of subjective imagery (“the attention model”) with two aims: (i) to outline a hierarchical processing, in which generation provides initial sensory reactivations, integration binds these features into coherent perceptual-like content, and amplification enhances them for conscious access, capturing both voluntary and spontaneous imagery; and (ii) to specify a putative neural implementation in a fronto-parietal-fusiform network shaped by two interacting attention systems. Aphantasia primarily reflects deficits in top-down modulation, with preserved generation but impaired integration and amplification of internal representations, linked to altered interactions between frontoparietal attention networks and the fusiform gyrus.\nOverall, this model reframes imagery as an active, constructive process shaped by the dynamic interplay of attention, sensory, and memory networks, rather than a passive reactivation of memory traces. It offers a testable mechanistic account of the neural substrates of subjective imagery and aphantasia, motivating future research on unconscious and conscious processing of internal representations.",

          "abstract": "Higher education institutions globally are trying to decolonise their curricula, aiming to make them more inclusive and representative. Some departments are also seeking to redress the colonial structures engrained within higher education. Students are central to this work. However, research exploring students’ views on curriculum decolonisation is limited. To address this, we interviewed 21 psychology students at a UK university and, using a critical realist lens, analysed contextual factors and mechanisms that may explain why students engage (or not) with decolonial initiatives, under what circumstances, and how. We analysed four contextual layers. At the individual layer, engagement was influenced by prior knowledge and beliefs, sense of agency, educational mindset and priorities, and teacher influence. At the interpersonal layer, peer influence, comfort and openness, class diversity, and teaching style influenced engagement. Within the institutional layer, factors including student workload, faculty diversity and training, and organisational emphasis shaped student engagement. The infrastructural layer involved historical exposure and knowledge, legacies, and perceived zeitgeist as influencing student engagement. Mechanisms including psychological safety, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and teacher enthusiasm appeared as key drivers influencing these contexts. We propose 11 Context-Mechanism-Outcome statements hypothesising how the learning environment, student and teacher identities, workload, prior beliefs and organisational support affect engagement with decolonial learning. Finally, we discuss how meritocratic ideals in education undermine student participation in decolonial initiatives.",

While both research traditions consider binding as an important mechanism for action control, they conceptualize this mechanism differently. Here, we argue that a comparison and synthesis of both research traditions might lead to a better understanding of the conceptualization of bindings. We first provide a brief overview of recent frameworks developed in the respective research traditions: the BRAC framework (Frings et al., 2020) and the procedural working memory (WM) model (Oberauer, 2013). We then analyze the similarities and differences between the BRAC and WM perspectives. As a first step toward fostering an integrative model of action control, we present an extension of the procedural WM model that can account for the main empirical findings investigated within the BRAC framework and that might serve as a blueprint for future integration.",

          "authors": "Guido Alessandri; Lorenzo Filosa; Richard Robins",
          "abstract": "Prior research examining the impact of job loss on personality change has yielded inconsistent findings. The present preregistered study extends prior research by analyzing longitudinal data from 1,111 predominantly 1st generation Mexican-origin adults, who reported on their employment status and Big Five personality traits up to eight times over 16 years. We explored the influence of both individual and spousal unemployment on three forms of personality trait stability and change: rank-order stability, Big Five profile stability, and mean-level changes. Job loss had no significant effects on rank-order stability, whether experienced by self or spousal. However, job loss was associated with lower profile stability; those who experienced unemployment showed lower stability in their personality profiles than those who remained employed. Job loss was associated with a wide range of mean-level personality changes; collectively, the findings suggest that the experience of unemployment can disrupt the normative process of maturation, leading to decreases in conscientiousness and agreeableness and impeding the typical decline in neuroticism. Our study is the first to establish a spillover effect of spousal job loss on partners' personality dynamics, demonstrating that personality changes can occur in response to a partner's job loss. In some cases these changes paralleled those found for one’s own job loss (declines in agreeableness and openness), whereas in other cases we found evidence of a compensatory effect (where individuals whose partner lost their job increased in conscientiousness). These findings highlight the importance of studying the effects of major life transitions on personality change in diverse samples.",

          "abstract": "Nosology, the classification of diseases or disorders, represents the systematic effort to organize diverse and complex clinical phenomena into meaningful and standardized descriptions of illness. In the field of psychopathology, the evolution of psychiatric nosology reflects the changing paradigms in our understanding of mental disorders. From the primordial attempts to categorize disorders based on spiritualistic perspectives to a more standardized approach influenced by clinical observations and scientific understandings. The 20th century witnessed the publication of the International Classification of Disease (ICD) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which have defined the constructs we study and treat for decades. Nevertheless, as the chapters in this book will no doubt serve to remind us, this journey is not without controversies and challenges. The inherent complexity and diversity of mental health conditions present difficulties in creating discrete categories that fully capture individuals’ experiences. Issues such as cultural variability and dynamic changes in mental health over time further complicate the task of constructing a reliable organization of psychopathology. \n\nGiven the shortcomings of traditional classification systems like the ICD and DSM, the field has recently witnessed the emergence of alternative approaches to classification, such as the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP; Kotov et al., 2017). The goal of this chapter is to briefly review important features of a useful nosology, describe the origin and structure of HiTOP, and discuss its implications for clinical practice, research endeavours, and the broader understanding of mental health within the context of an ever-evolving scientific landscape. Additionally, we will address some of the major criticisms of the quantitative approach to classification represented by HiTOP and describe ongoing efforts to address them.",

We conducted the experiments in classrooms in Northern Italy, the study employed an ecological design with real-world stimuli and a digital cellphone-based platform, engaging 2,288 students. Participants evaluated Instagram posts containing scientific and pseudoscientific content before and after the interventions. While previous research shows the efficacy of these techniques in controlled environments, this study found no significant improvement in students’ ability to discern accurate information. However, COR indirectly enhanced accuracy by promoting lateral reading and click restraint, albeit among a small subset. Conversely, the INOC approach increased generalised scepticism, leading to reduced trust in scientifically valid content. We observe that unlike in non-ecological environments, the classroom environment poses challenges, including distractions and varied engagement, highlighting the difficulty of scaling interventions from controlled to real-world settings. Despite these results, the study underscores the importance of refining educational strategies and adapting them to dynamic, real-world contexts to enhance digital literacy.",

          "abstract": "Brain regions differ in the intrinsic timescales over which they integrate, shaping the information they encode; and these differences change with development. Here we used EEG to investigate how intrinsic timescales develop from infancy to toddlerhood and how they compare to adults. A recent rs-fMRI study found sleeping neonates had longer timescales than awake adults. However, fMRI is affected by hemodynamics, has limited temporal resolution, and timescales may be affected by sleep. Therefore, EEG was used to measure intrinsic timescales in infants longitudinally from 6 to 16-months-old (exploratory cohort, N=45; validation cohort, N=45) and adults (N=10). Infants were awake and engaged in visual stimulation, and adults were recorded under comparable (vs. different) conditions. Six-month-olds’ timescales were longer than those of adults in comparable conditions, and they shortened from 6 to 16-months-old. Finally, in younger infants, brain timescales correlated to alpha rhythm self-predictability. Longer intrinsic timescales early in infancy, a finding which generalises across fMRI and EEG, might act as an inductive bias favouring the learning of holistic abstract representations. Delineating the mechanisms underlying brain processing timescales in infants is a crucial step towards understanding the neural mechanisms which could allow infants to extract and learn patterns from the environment.",

While loneliness is a primary driver for seeking AI companionship, these systems are not designed for mental health support and can pose risks like failing to identify distress, expressing stigma, or even facilitating suicidal ideation.\nThe clinical concern is whether these frictionless AI relationships displace human connection and inadvertently exacerbate existing psychopathology. Clinicians must assess the function of AI relationships and understand the conditioning cycle.\nImplications for practice include integrating AI companion questions into assessments, formulating their role in the client's psychological world, leveraging the human therapeutic alliance, intervening to build real-world social skills, and providing ethical guidance on AI mental health tools.

Data were collected using studio cameras and accelerometers. We found significant interactions between visual contact, activity type, and trial on various behavioral markers. Visual contact between singers increased head and hand movements across all activities. Hand synchrony was significantly higher during musical activities vs chat. Also, structured musical activities (monophony and polyphony) increased head synchrony, tone onset energy, and tone onset synchrony compared to free-form activities (chat and improvisation).

Statistical techniques such as paired sample t-tests, correlation analysis and multiple regression were employed.\nFindings: Results indicated that OB significantly and positively correlates with EI (r = 0.582, p &lt; 0.001) and SI (r = 0.537, p &lt; 0.001). Similarly, HB exhibits a significant positive relationship with EI (r = 0.340, p &lt; 0.001) and SI (r = 0.418, p &lt; 0.001). By contrast, AB demonstrates a significant negative relationship with EI (r = −0.209, p &lt; 0.001) and SI (r = −0.171, p &lt; 0.001).\nOriginality: This work extends research on decision-making biases beyond financial and investment contexts by examining their role in workplace settings. It contributes to behavioural economics and organisational studies by offering empirical evidence from Singapore, a context underrepresented in existing literature.\nResearch limitations/implications: This study focused on only three biases within a cross-sectional quantitative design, which may be affected by survey errors and outliers. Future research should test additional biases, stages and moderating factors across industries, regions and disciplines to build a more comprehensive understanding of workplace decision-making.\nPractical implications: The research contributes to a better understanding of organisational decision-making practices for employees in the workplace when heuristics and biases are present.

Building upon a comprehensive systematic literature review (Ohms 2025g), which identified key research gaps and prominent cognitive biases, and a subsequent paper detailing the research framework and hypothesis development (Ohms 2025f), this study aimed to holistically assess the complex interplay between biases, decision-making stages, and moderating factors. The robust methodological design (Ohms 2025e) and data validation procedures (Ohms 2025a), including outlier detection, normality assessment, and reliability testing, provided the essential foundation for advanced statistical analysis. This paper specifies, estimates, and systematically refines the SEM model through a backward elimination strategy. It elaborates on the choice of a robust estimator, the interpretation of various model fit indices (e.g., Chi-square, CFI, TLI, RMSEA, AIC, BIC), and the iterative selection of the most simplified yet well-fitting model (Model 15). By thoroughly documenting the rigorous SEM model selection methodology, this paper contributes to establishing a strong analytical basis for subsequent empirical investigations into direct and moderated relationships, ensuring the reliability and validity of the holistic insights derived from the research.",

Building from the theoretical foundation established by Ohms (2025h) and the significant research gaps noted by Ohms (2025i),  this study uses a cross-sectional, mono-quantitative survey methodology (Ohms (2025g) of 365 employees in Singapore. Additionally, Ohms (2025a) documented the data validation and preliminary analysis, which provided a concrete basis for more complex analyses. Hence, this paper builds upon the analysis of direct effects reported by Ohms (2025b, 2025c) and applies the specific methodological procedures for moderation detailed by Ohms (2025e). Results from multiple regression with robust standard errors show that time pressure does not significantly moderate the strong effects of overconfidence and herding biases on either stage of information processing. However, time pressure moderates the relationship between decision avoidance and information evaluation by weakening the negative impact of avoidance. These results contribute to behavioural economics and provide helpful information for organisational decision-making in the Singaporean workplace by emphasising the selective nature of time pressure as a contextual stressor.",

(Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review. doi:10.3758/s13423-023-02448-2, 2024) argued that findings which suggest that memories for items become less accessible over time conflict with categorisation findings where exemplar performance improves across training. To reconcile this, they highlighted that under real-world conditions items tend to reappear less frequently over time, thus preferentially maintaining new items can improve performance. Typical categorisation experiments instead distribute exemplars uniformly across trials. Instead, under a power-law stimulus distribution Devraj et al. showed worsening fit for exemplar classification models across trials. They used this as evidence that forgetting behaviour adapted to task demands, reducing exemplar were accessibility and encouraging prototype use for classification decisions. By re-analysing the same data, we argue instead that this pattern can be produced with exemplar-forgetting in both conditions. By systematically increasing in the delays across which stimuli were tested, their Experimental condition exaggerated the effects of forgetting on performance in later trials compared to the Control condition. This resulted in a reversal of performance growth across trials – instead leading to a steady decline in performance. As exemplar model-fit advantage is expected to vary with performance, we suggest that trends in this advantage are not diagnostic of a shift in classification strategy. We found that a forgetting-function improved exemplar model fit to Devraj et al.’s data, and under reasonable parameters could predict the observed patterns of performance and model-fit a-priori. Compared with a strategy-shifting mixture model, exemplar-forgetting provided equivalent fits despite being more theoretically parsimonious. We suggest power-law memory decay does not produce a tension between categorisation and memory findings, as increased forgetting is found across longer retention intervals whereas the delay between exemplar learning and classification remains constant across typical categorisation experiments.",

          "authors": "Adam Lockwood; Jeffrey Brown",
          "abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into school psychology is evolving rapidly, presenting both opportunities and challenges. AI has the potential to enhance educational and mental health services by facilitating data-driven decision-making, streamlining administrative tasks, and offering personalized interventions for students. However, biases inherent in AI systems—reflecting the prejudices of developers and historical data—pose significant risks of exacerbating systemic inequalities. This paper examines AI’s historical context, current applications in education, and specific uses within school psychology. It also discusses the socio-political factors contributing to algorithmic biases, data privacy concerns, and language/cultural inequities in AI systems. Recommendations are offered to mitigate AI biases, emphasizing the importance of diverse representation in AI development, comprehensive policy formation, transparency, and community involvement. Addressing these concerns is crucial for ensuring that AI contributes equitably to student success.",

          "authors": "Wenyue Gao; Yoko Nagai; Juha Silvanto",
          "abstract": "Aphantasia (the inability to voluntarily generate mental imagery) has traditionally been studied as a congenital or neurological condition. However, historical and clinical reports also implicate affective and stress-related factors in the onset of imagery loss, which are themselves associated with disrupted interoception and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. To investigate these links, we surveyed individuals with self-identified acquired aphantasia (N = 59) using structured questions and validated questionnaires assessing early adversity (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire), anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), autonomic reactivity (Body Perception Questionnaire–Short Form; Atrial Fibrillation Symptoms Questionnaire), and neurodevelopmental traits (AQ-10, ASRS-6). 62% of participants reported psychological triggers, 41% cited neurological or physiological events, and 30% identified pharmacological factors. Notably, nearly half of the participants described a combination of these influences, with psychological factors frequently co-occurring with medication use or physical events, suggesting that acquired aphantasia may often arise from a multifactorial interplay rather than a single isolated cause. Compared to typical imagers, individuals with acquired aphantasia reported significantly higher levels of childhood trauma and increased supra-diaphragmatic autonomic reactivity. People with acquired aphantasia also showed significantly elevated scores on measures of ADHD (especially inattention) and autistic traits. These findings suggest that acquired aphantasia may not only follow neurological injury but can also emerge in the context of affective conditions shaped by early adversity and neurodevelopmental vulnerability. Affective disturbances may contribute to imagery loss by altering the subjective experience of autonomic signals and disrupting the integration of bodily, emotional, and cognitive information required to generate vivid mental representations. In conclusion, these results support an affective-autonomic pathway to acquired aphantasia.",

          "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) holds promise for addressing the global burden of mental health conditions by expanding access to care. This article critically reviews recent research evaluating Gen-AI chatbots for the treatment of common mental disorders. Methodological analysis reveals encouraging evidence for the formation of a therapeutic alliance between users and Gen-AI chatbots, but also underscores important ethical and methodological considerations, including potential selection bias, insufficiently diverse samples and the need for constant human supervision. \nEmerging reports of Gen-AI potentially triggering psychosis-like symptoms raise additional safety considerations, highlighting the importance of robust participant screening and clear clinical protocols. Building on these findings, we propose a novel approach to enhance Gen-AI's therapeutic effectiveness by having it mimic a user's psychological traits, thereby strengthening the human-AI affiliation, an example of socioaffective alignment. While the integration of Gen-AI into clinical practice requires rigorous testing, ethical oversight, and interdisciplinary collaboration, this article suggests a path toward developing psychologically-informed Gen-AI models to improve accessibility, personalisation and mental healthcare outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Purpose of Review: This commentary summarizes how the intense and distinctive subjective effects of psychedelics complicate tests of the efficacy and mechanisms of action (MOAs) of psychedelic-assisted treatments (PATs) for mental-health conditions. Specifically, we discuss a) how estimates of PAT efficacy are confounded under functional unblinding and b) uncertainty surrounding whether subjective or neurobiological effects are causal therapeutic MOAs of PATs. We then review methodological solutions to address these challenges.\n\nRecent Findings: Several novel methodologies have been discussed in the literature. For testing PAT efficacy under functional unblinding, potential solutions include improved active placebo conditions, expectancy-focused recruitment and consent procedures, better measurement of expectancies and blinding, and more rigorous statistical modeling. For testing whether subjective effects are causal MOAs in PATs, strategies that disentangle the subjective and neurobiological effects of psychedelics are needed. Potential methods include administering psychedelics under general anesthesia, developing non-psychoactive psychedelic analogues, leveraging Mendelian randomization, and studying psychedelic microdosing. Participant safety and ethical considerations are critical for many of these strategies. Ultimately, combining multiple innovative methods may offer the most robust insights. \n\nSummary: Future empirical efforts to develop these strategies will be crucial for advancing our limited understanding of whether and how PATs achieve clinical benefits in psychiatry.",

          "authors": "Maggie Toplak; Adam Burnett; Peter Bieling",
          "abstract": "Research training has been an integral part of training requirements for the professional practice of psychology since the original scientist-practitioner Boulder model.  The field of psychology can attribute its productivity and progress to the systematic empirical study of human behaviour. This unique feature of our discipline ensures that the professional practice of psychology is based on a solid foundation. However, since its inception, the professional practice of psychology has been compelled to manage the dialectical struggle between advancing science and training clinicians. There is also what has come be called the Two Hat Problem, whereby research and clinical training have never been fully integrated in training for professional practice, neither in the original conceptualization of the Boulder model nor in subsequent competency-based models. For example, the conceptual separation of foundational and functional domains of competency-based models may have inadvertently further separated research from clinical training. In addition, several practical considerations have also emerged, such as the growing demands of training programs, absence of evidence showing that research training transfers to clinical practice and concerns regarding shortages in practitioners to meet mental health demands in our society. Given these issues, we need to sharpen our definition of what kinds of scientific and research training best support the professional practice of psychology. This paper proposes several recommendations and a working taxonomy of the types of concepts and illustrative empirical studies that integrate research and scientific thinking with clinical competencies for professional practice. If training integrates research and scientific thinking, it will reveal a unifying strategy to define competencies and coherence in the profession. Such integration will require some new thinking for training programs, but it will preserve our profession’s distinction from other mental health care professions, ones that do not have research and scientific thinking built into the core of their training.",

While prior research established the model using a large sample (N = 4,000) and a long assessment (27 items), practical applications require guidance on whether DFSM can be reliably used with fewer students and shorter assessments. A fully crossed Monte Carlo simulation varying sample sizes (N = 250, 500, 1,000, 4,000) and assessment lengths (J = 9, 18, 27) was conducted where we evaluated item parameter, facet structure, and student latent profile recovery. Results showed that assessment length most strongly influenced item parameter recovery, with at least 18 items necessary to obtain unbiased estimates even for small samples. In contrast, facet sparsity and profile recovery were more sensitive to sample size, requiring at least 500 students for accurate estimation. We provide recommendations for assessment developers and educators on using DFSM in applied contexts.",

We present a theoretical integration of meaning and attention, followed by five studies investigating their relationship in lab experiments and everyday life (total N = 1,654). Experimental findings indicate that meaning increased attention (Studies 1 &amp; 3), and attention increased meaning, but only when meaning could be found in a stimulus (Studies 2a, 2b &amp; 3). An experience-sampling study further reveals a positive meaning–attention association at dispositional, situational, and cross-levels (Study 4). Across varied daily activities, participants reported greater meaning when they paid more attention. These studies also explored the interplay of meaning and attention with boredom, negative emotions, and subjective well-being. Together, our results suggest that paying attention during everyday activities can, in some instances, enhance the experience of meaning.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated the role of perceptual learning in the composite face effect (CFE), which is characterized by reduced accuracy in recognizing the top half of a face when it is combined with the bottom half of another face—particularly when the composite is upright and aligned—compared to when the two halves are laterally offset (misaligned). The misalignment disrupts configural/holistic processing, affecting recognition performance. Experiment 1a (n=96) employed prototype-defined artificial stimuli—checkerboards—to investigate the presence of the composite effect. The advantage of using these stimuli is that expertise can be precisely controlled. Experiment 1b (n=96) aimed to replicate the composite effect using face stimuli, serving as a control and enabling direct comparison of the effect between face and checkerboard stimuli. Both experiments employed a full design that included congruent and incongruent, aligned and misaligned composites to measure the composite effect. Results from Experiment 1a indicated that the composite effect could not be obtained with checkerboard composites, whereas Experiment 1b confirmed the robust presence of the CFE in face stimuli. Based on these findings, we can interpret that perceptual learning does not significantly contribute to the emergence of the CFE.",

Adults based in China (N = 161) and the UK (N = 155) completed questionnaires assessing emotion beliefs and regulation. Chinese participants reported stronger beliefs in the controllability, usefulness, and acceptability beliefs of negative emotions and greater overall use of emotion regulation strategies than British participants. Across both cultures, controllability belief predicted the use of both antecedent- and response-focused strategies. Usefulness beliefs predicted greater situation modification and acceptability predicted increased suppression. Controllability beliefs also mediated cultural differences in the use of all strategies, while usefulness and acceptability beliefs mediated cultural differences in suppression. These effects remained significant even after controlling for self-construals. Both acceptability and controllability beliefs were stronger negative predictors of suppression among British than among Chinese. Our findings suggest that selection of emotion regulation strategies depends on emotion beliefs. They also highlight the role of culturally influenced emotion beliefs in shaping emotion regulation beyond self-construals.",

          "abstract": "The ability to process facial displays of emotion is a crucial aspect of everyday interpersonal interactions, yet the use of emotions as communicative tools for situational context information remains underexplored. This study, conducted in 2024, addresses this gap by using a novel dynamic display of targets’ reactions to a poker game to assess perceivers ' ability to detect contextual information from facial displays of emotion. We categorised targets’ dynamic facial displays of emotional reactions to game outcomes using MorphCast Emotion AI HTML5 SDK, an online machine-learning tool that detects emotions in recorded videos. Additionally, we investigated the role of perceivers ' covert facial mimicry during the categorisation task using facial electromyography (fEMG). Results indicate that while perceivers achieved above-chance accuracy in guessing targets’ outcomes (win, loss,or draw) from facial displays of emotion, they struggled to distinguish between losses and draws. Further, although emotions (positive vs. negative)appear to act as cues for outcome detection, fEMG data reveal no significant pattern of activation linked to outcome accuracy. These findings highlight facial display of emotion as a communicative tool for contextual information and the role of experience, societal and cultural norms in constructing subjective yet socially expected reactions across individuals. Most participants identified as white or Asian, limiting the sample variability and generalisability, particularly due to the underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minority participants. Future research should include a more diverse sample to understand the cultural influences on expression and interpretation of facial displays of emotion.",

Participants were recruited from Prolific, a crowdsourcing platform (N = 164), and completed four cognitive ability tasks, a narrative interview with an ICA, and a battery of survey measures. Our findings indicate that older adults can engage meaningfully with an ICA and provide enough textual cues to assess personality on par with previous studies on younger adult samples. These older adults also reported that they enjoyed the interaction and found it easy to use and concentrate throughout the interview. We were able to use the textual responses from the narrative interview to assess cognitive ability to a limited extent, primarily capturing aspects of verbal fluency; however, correlations of narrative-based cognitive ability scores with self-reported cognitive functioning and health outcomes were weak. Overall, these results suggest that ICA systems are not only feasible but also engaging and easy for older adults to use. This presents a promising first step towards the development of automated, scalable tools for cognitive evaluation.

While often considered antagonistic, recent evidence suggests they may also coexist as independent tendencies. Cultural norms may shape how these behaviors interact, yet few studies have directly examined their dynamics across cultural contexts. Building on differences in Eastern collectivistic and Western individualistic information-processing and thinking styles, we proposed an integrated model with four cultural regulatory pathways (Eastern Holistic, Eastern Dialectic, Western Analytic, Western Logistic) and examined prosociality-aggression dynamics at both country and individual levels. Secondary data were analyzed from 121 college students in Taiwan (N = 50, Mage = 21.10; representing a collectivistic culture) and the United States (N = 71, Mage = 20.01; representing an individualistic culture). Prosocial and aggressive tendencies to strangers were measured based on task-based paradigms, and individual cultural orientation were measured by self-reported questionnaires. Results revealed that Taiwanese participants exhibited a uni-dimensional, antagonistic relationship between reactive prosociality and aggression, whereas U.S. participants demonstrated a bi-dimensional pattern in which the two behaviors functioned independently. At the individual level, higher horizontal collectivism predicted a stronger antagonistic dynamic between prosociality and aggression, and especially in reactive subtype. Together, these findings provide support for the Holistic-Analytic information-processing framework, suggesting that collectivistic orientations may integrate prosocial and aggressive tendencies into an antagonistic relationship, while individualistic orientations allow them to coexist independently. This study highlights culture’s critical role in shaping social-emotional behavior across countries and individual levels, paving the way for future research and culturally tailored prevention strategies.",

          "abstract": "People differ in their ability to distinguish visually similar items, a domain-general ability known as o (Richler et al., 2019). While o typically involves extracting invariant object properties, we investigated whether it also relates to long-term memory for episodic information extrinsic to object identity, specifically, object location. We further examined whether this relationship is influenced by stimulus meaningfulness, a factor known to enhance long-term memory, by using both high- and low-meaning stimuli. Participants completed a location memory test, a series of visual object-recognition tasks assessing o, and other cognitive covariate measures. Results showed a positive correlation between o and location memory, which was stronger for high-meaning than for low-meaning stimuli. This suggests that semantic content may enhance the link between object recognition and episodic location memory. Importantly, these effects remained after controlling for age, gender, low-level visual perception, working memory, and general intelligence. Our findings indicate that domain-general object recognition ability contributes to episodic memory by supporting the binding of meaningful objects to their spatial context. This challenges traditional cognitive boundaries by integrating current knowledge about individual differences in perception and memory, with semantic meaning acting as a significant moderator.",

          "abstract": "Successful teamwork depends on interpersonal dynamics, the ways in which individuals coordinate, influence, and adapt to one another over time. Existing measures of interpersonal dynamics, such as CRQA, correlation, Granger causality, and transfer entropy, typically capture only a single dimension: either the synchrony/coordination or the direction of influence between individuals. What is missing is a psychologically meaningful representation that unifies these dimensions and varies systematically with behavior. We propose the context matrix as one such representation. The context matrix, modeled within a linear dynamical system, has psychologically interpretable entries specifying how much each individual’s current behavior is attributable to their own versus every other group member’s past behaviors. Critically, these entries can be distilled into summary features that represent synchrony and directional influence. Evidence for the context matrix as psychologically meaningful is provided in two steps. First, we develop a sequential Bayesian model that infers context matrices from timeseries data and show that it accurately recovers them in noisy simulations. Second, applying the model to human eyetracking data, we show that summary features of the inferred context matrices capture expected task-based differences in interpersonal dynamics (or lack thereof), predict task accuracy in psychologically reasonable ways, and show some correspondence with existing measures (CRQA and Granger causality). We conclude by situating the context matrix within a broader agenda for modeling interpersonal dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Value and affective valence are pivotal constructs in decision and emotion science that are commonly believed to be closely connected. However, there is no consensus on precisely how these constructs relate, with different researchers adopting substantially different views. Here, we sought to clarify this relationship by providing a critical test of two leading hypotheses: that affective valence tracks value, and that affective valence tracks value updates (i.e., changes in value). To accomplish this goal, we assessed the determinants of valence in a context where these hypotheses make clear and dissociable predictions – classical conditioning. Across three studies, we found consistent evidence that affective valence tracks value, rather than value updates. Additionally, we show that more optimistic expectations can lead to more positive affective responses to actual outcomes. Altogether, our results clarify the relationship between value and affective valence, and thus inform the broad range of psychological research that depends on an understanding of the connection between these constructs.",

          "abstract": "The healthcare sector, especially dentistry, contributes significantly to the environmental crisis. The behaviors and attitudes of dentists regarding sustainability practices may differ markedly; we applied the Stated and Revealed Preferences framework to compare these. Our aim was to assess a mixed method innovation, encompassing material use, digital technologies, and preventive measures in dentistry. We recruited 16 dentists based on two quotas: sex and the funding source of the clinic. Dentists’ behaviors were recorded through the structured observation of four patient sessions, while their attitudes were examined via structured interviews exploring barriers to more sustainable practices. Observation results were visualized for each dentist, depicting sustainable and unsustainable choices per session. Barriers were visualized in network graphs employing the Qualitative Network Approach. Observational data helped pinpoint (un)sustainable practices across cases and highlighted individuals whose practices diverged from the group. Qualitative networks helped identify frequent and rare associations between barriers, their types, directionality, along with themes in interview narratives. Triangulating the two data sources provided insight into case idiosyncrasies, prevalent rationales in decision-making, and apparent contradictions between intra-case behavior and attitudes. These, in turn, aided in refining data collection instruments and guiding further analyses. This novel method advances research by examining sustainable behavior on the level of individual choices, mapping the relationships between barriers, and triangulating data sources bidirectionally, thus offering the potential to inform targeted interventions that enhance sustainable practices in dentistry.",

          "abstract": "Antisemitism, a persistent form of cultural prejudice, is increasingly manifesting in subtle and modernized forms within contemporary society. This study examined how cultural representations of Jews are encoded in large language models (LLMs), which absorb societal discourse through training on vast corpora of human-generated text. To investigate these representations, we developed an indirect methodology: generating character biographies using Jewish and non-Jewish names, removing overt identity markers, and prompting the LLM to evaluate a range of psychological and sociocultural traits. Characters associated with Jewish (vs. non-Jewish) names were consistently rated as more competent, privileged, dominant, self-controlled, future-oriented, hierarchical, and obsessive—and as less likable and less collectivistic. When these trait profiles were mapped onto fictional characters, they aligned with archetypes historically associated with antisemitic tropes. These findings demonstrate how latent stereotypes can persist in AI systems despite explicit bias mitigation, highlighting the adaptability of prejudice and the structural embedding of cultural archetypes in contemporary technologies.",

          "abstract": "Musicians convey different timing ‘feels’ in groove-based performance by manipulating onset asynchrony between instruments (playing ahead/on/behind the beat) and the durational ratio of metrical subdivisions (non-isochrony, or ‘swing’). The present study asked whether listeners perceive such fine-grained timing deviations, which place demands on perceptual grouping, attentional allocation, and temporal prediction, in complex, multi-instrumental groove contexts. We measured just-noticeable difference (JND) thresholds of asynchrony and swing in a naturalistic funk pattern featuring guitar, bass, and drums (kick, snare, hi-hat). Sixty-four participants (32 musicians, 32 non-musicians) completed a 1IFC staircase task with uniform onset displacements (asynchrony: ±1–100 ms; swing: +1–71.5 ms). Pupillary responses were recorded throughout. These have been shown to index attentional allocation and sensory conflict, offering a useful physiological complement to behavioral measures of microrhythm. Thresholds varied systematically by instrument: for asynchrony, Kick, Snare, and Hi-hat yielded the lowest JNDs (≈19–24ms), while Bass and Guitar required the largest displacements (≈31–35ms). For swing, thresholds were lowest when Drums or All Instruments swung together (≈24–26ms), and highest for Bass and Guitar (≈32–34ms). An asymmetric effect of temporal direction was found, with late displacements (≈28ms) harder to detect than early ones (≈23ms).  Musical training generally conferred lower thresholds. We also found a linear relationship between pupil size and both asynchrony and non-isochrony, further indicating that the pupil indexes saliency in the processing of microrhythm.  The findings expand our understanding of perceptual boundaries for microrhythmic expression in multi-layered groove music and highlight how both acoustic and experiential factors shape sensitivity to timing nuances.",

We asked American owners of herding dogs to complete an online survey about their dog’s (n = 335) personality traits, behavioral traits, and herding ability. We grouped related personality traits together in a principal components analysis to create dog personality profiles. Next, we determined whether any dog personality profiles predicted herding ability. We partially replicate Wilson et al.’s (2022) findings, with similar personality profiles predicting herding ability. We then expanded on the previous study by creating a new set of profiles that also included behavioral traits. We found that both personality and behavioral traits predicted herding ability. We propose that herding dog handlers and breeders should focus on key personality and behavioral traits when making decisions about herding dog career paths and training efforts.",

          "abstract": "The integration of auditory and visual cues supports efficient speech and emotion perception, yet little is known about how emotional salience interacts with temporal congruency during audiovisual binding. In this study, 125 participants completed a synchrony judgment task using dynamic face–voice pairs varying in emotion (angry, happy, neutral), congruency, and temporal alignment. Temporal binding windows (TBWs), or the temporal offsets within which a stimulus pair is perceived as perceptually bound, were calculated for each condition. TBWs were significantly wider for emotionally salient (angry, happy) compared to neutral congruent pairs, indicating greater tolerance for temporal asynchrony in the presence of emotion. Moreover, across multiple analytic approaches, emotionally congruent pairs yielded narrower TBWs than incongruent pairs, demonstrating that emotional congruence influences low-level perceptual aspects of multisensory integration. These results suggest that emotion, as a higher-order cue to bind, interacts with low-level temporal information to bias causal inference toward integration. Our findings extend models of multisensory integration by highlighting the interaction of emotion and low-level stimulus properties as a dimension shaping audiovisual binding. This work has implications for understanding social communication and may provide insight into populations with known difficulties in both emotion perception and multisensory integration.",

Timeless books—popular well after publication—are a rare occurrence, standing the test of time and distinguishing themselves from the millions of books published each year. Is it possible to predict which books will be timeless, versus merely best-selling, based on word usage alone? We built two corpora of books, published between 1909 and 1923: (1) those that were best-selling (i.e., popular upon publication), and (2) those that have become timeless (i.e., popular a century later). Machine learning models were then trained to predict whether a novel was timeless or merely best-selling, based on mostly word-level psycholinguistic features. Our models were able to achieve approximately 70% classification accuracy and identified several key features of timeless books that distinguished them from those merely popular upon publication (e.g., fewer social words; more plural pronouns and words per sentence).",

Higher levels of religious identification, involvement, and coping, altruistic behavior, social support, optimism, and mindfulness, as well as lower levels of pessimism, were found in the group(s) with the highest PTG.

I describe the core strengths of CDA for personality development research, including its capacity to test lifespan theories and detect nuanced patterns of change, to address key limitations of traditional meta-analysis, to systematically disentangle substantive variability from artifactual variability, and to distinguish robust null findings from false negatives. I also highlight key challenges, such as false consensus, data availability, and preregistration constraints, and offer recommendations for addressing them. Finally, I showcase the broader impact of CDA for the personality development field, emphasizing its potential to inspire future research, uncover context-specific patterns, and promote more collaborative, open, and cumulative science.",

This finding has usually been attributed to the incorporation of distinctive sensorimotor information into the memory record of items read aloud, facilitating their successful retrieval during the memory test. Less research has explored other cognitive or motivational differences between the aloud and silent conditions. Here we used pupillometry to explore the time course of attention allocated during aloud, silent, and control (say “check”) study trials. Across four experiments, instructions were presented either concurrently with or preceding the word. To permit evaluation of preparatory processing independent of a verbal response, we explored the case where responses had to be withheld until a “Go” signal appeared. In addition to the typical behavioral production effect in memory, each experiment also revealed a pupillometric production effect (greater pupil dilation for aloud than for silent words) that—while separable from the act of speaking itself—was correlated with the size of the memory benefit. Critically, this pupillometric-behavioral correlation did not occur for control (say “check”) trials. We interpret these findings as support for an initial attention-focusing effect that comes from preparing for and executing vocalization during both aloud and control trials, followed by a phase of distinctive processing of target word features that is unique to aloud trials.",

This randomized-controlled experiment was an advanced followup-study of a Nextdoor-study (Katsaros et al., 2023) conducted a year before, showing mostly null effects of the intervention. In this study, the results showed a significant reduction in two target outcomes - views of offensive posts and comments - in the treatment group compared to the control group.

No one path into extremism has been identified in the literature, with no specific profile of those who engage in radicalisation, extremism and/or terrorism existing. The GLM allows for a focus on individuality and identity, accounting for the variation of individual’s found to hold extremist views.

          "abstract": "With the recent expansion of social networking platforms, we are increasingly presented with opportunities to evaluate others by reading their profiles without direct interaction. Uncertainty reduction theory (URT) posits that as an individual’s uncertainty diminishes, they are evaluated as more attractive. While past studies have predominantly examined the relationship between uncertainty and attraction by focusing on the amount of accessible information, little attention has been paid to qualitative aspects of information (i.e., how information is described). In light of this, the present study investigates the effect of expression abstractness in profiles on attraction to the target individual. Given that concrete expressions convey richer information than abstract ones, we hypothesized that (1) a person described in more (positive) concrete terms would be perceived as more attractive, and (2) the level of uncertainty would mediate this effect. To test these hypotheses, we conducted an online experiment with 1,003 native adult Japanese speakers. Participants were assigned to either a concrete or abstract condition and rated ten target individuals, each described in a profile consisting of five sentences; two of the five sentences were subject to the abstractness manipulation. Consistent with our prediction, the results demonstrated that participants in the concrete condition evaluated target individuals more favorably than those in the abstract condition. In addition, mediation analysis showed that this effect was mediated by attributional confidence (i.e., perceived uncertainty) regarding the target individual. These findings indicate that uncertainty reduction enhances interpersonal attraction even in online unilateral browsing situations, and that manipulating the abstractness of character descriptions can serve as an effective method of altering perceived uncertainty.

Seeing the broken pottery tells you something, but hearing the crash tells you even more. In this work, we explore people's inferences about the past from multimodal evidence. We present a physical reasoning paradigm called Plinko. In the prediction task, participants must determine where a ball that is dropped into a box with obstacles will land. A computational model that uses mental simulation in an Intuitive Physics Engine captures participant predictions very well. In the inference task, participants must infer which hole in the box the ball fell from. Across conditions, participants are presented with different combinations of visual and auditory cues, and must combine this information to determine what happened. We develop a sequential sampling model that selectively simulates from promising hypotheses, and demonstrate that this model accurately captures participants' judgments and eye-movements. By coordinating sensory evidence in an underlying causal representation of the physical world, this simulation approach is able to capture complex multimodal inferences that go beyond traditional approaches to multimodal integration.",

We investigated the relationship between symptom severity, attributional biases, and perceptions of emotional relationships and risk behaviors (ERRB) from both perspectives. Six female patients with BPD receiving outpatient treatment in Brazil and six family members participated. Data were collected remotely and included a BPD symptom measure, an attributional bias task, and semi-structured interviews for genogram construction exploring family ERRB. Patients showed higher intentionality scores (p = 0.0357) and more reports of physical abuse (p = 0.0235), whereas family members reported more distant/poor relationships (p = 0.0198). Categorical symptom severity correlated with suspected alcohol and drug use (p = 0.0117), and personalization bias predicted continuous symptom severity (β = 0.16, p = 0.0283). Qualitative analysis identified significant relationships within each dyad and the family members involved. These findings highlight how attributional biases and ERRB shape BPD symptoms and suggest that integrating family narratives with cognitive assessments enriches clinical understanding of underlying mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Behavioral flexibility—the ability to adapt behavior in response to changing conditions—is widely recognized as a key feature of animal cognition. It is often measured using reversal learning tasks, where individuals must inhibit a previously rewarded response and adopt a new one after contingencies shift. Despite its widespread use, the comparability of these tasks across species remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review of 206 empirical studies (2014–2023) spanning eight major taxonomic groups: invertebrates, fishes, amphibians and reptiles, birds, rodents, other mammals, non-human primates, and humans. For each study, we extracted variables related to taxon coverage, sampling, learning and reversal criteria, cue types, and outcome measures. Analyses included nonparametric tests to assess group-level differences, linear discriminant analyses to explore multivariate structure, and model-based robustness checks. Our findings reveal three fundamental obstacles to reliable cross-species inference. First, research effort is highly imbalanced: birds, rodents, and humans accounted for over half of all study cells, while most animal diversity—especially invertebrates and amphibians and reptiles—remains virtually untested, with less than 1% of described species included per taxon. Second, research is taxonomically siloed: 99% of studies focus on a single group, limiting opportunities for direct comparison. Third, and most critically, methodological standards diverge dramatically across taxa. Humans were consistently held to the strictest learning criteria (median threshold 90%), while birds, invertebrates, and fishes most often used lower thresholds (80–84%). Overtraining was implemented in two-thirds of amphibian and reptile studies but was rare (less than 30%) elsewhere. The number of reversal phases differed more than threefold among groups. Nearly all studies of amphibians, reptiles, fishes, and invertebrates used single-reversal designs, whereas multi-reversal protocols were much more common in humans and non-human primates. Sample sizes—both per cell and per study—, evaluation window lengths, cue types, and outcome metrics also displayed taxon-specific patterns. These systematic differences in experimental design introduce structural asymmetries that complicate cross-taxon comparisons, blurring the line between true cognitive variation and methodological artifacts. Although research to date has advanced our understanding, further progress will depend on greater methodological coordination and broader taxonomic coverage. Emerging large-scale collaborations are beginning to address these gaps, offering a promising path toward a more robust and equitable science of behavioral flexibility.",

          "abstract": "This chapter focuses on multidisciplinary teaching strategies for open qualitative research. It addresses open science values (transparency, reproducibility, and inclusivity), practices (preregistration, replication, data sharing, etc.), and class activities. Teaching qualitative open science is more effectively accomplished when researchers conceptualize scientific processes as expressions of human cognition and various types of labor with the goal of creating usable and reliable documentation for posterity. This chapter covers practices developed within qualitative paradigms (reflexivity, audit trails, negative case analysis, etc.) and offers suggestions for how to lead diverse populations of students through the logic and application of these paradigms. Emphasizing contextual integrity, the chapter explores how to ethically balance openness with participant confidentiality and cultural sensitivity. While this chapter focuses on qualitative perspectives, these perspectives and practices are also relevant and beneficial to those working with quantitative data and methods.",

          "abstract": "Music engages multiple brain networks simultaneously, yet most studies examine these networks in isolation. We investigated functional connectivity among auditory, motor, and reward networks during music listening in different contexts using fMRI data from two samples (N=39 each): focused music listening and background music during cognitive tasks. ROI-to-ROI, seed-based, and graph theory analyses examined connectivity patterns among 46 regions spanning the three networks. Both contexts showed enhanced within-auditory network connectivity compared to rest, suggesting this is fundamental to music processing. However, between-network patterns diverged markedly. Background music during cognitive tasks preserved reward-motor coupling while reducing auditory-motor and auditory-reward connectivity. Focused music listening produced widespread negative correlations between motor regions and both auditory and reward networks, potentially reflecting motor suppression in the scanner environment. Graph theory measures revealed context-specific hub reorganization: reward regions (nucleus accumbens, caudate) showed increased centrality during background music, while amygdala and frontal orbital cortex were selectively enhanced during focused listening. These findings demonstrate that music engagement involves context-dependent network reorganization beyond simple attention effects. The same musical stimulus engages different neural mechanisms depending on concurrent cognitive demands, motor requirements, and listening goals. Enhanced within-auditory connectivity appears consistent across contexts, but between-network interactions are shaped by the broader cognitive-behavioral context. These results highlight the importance of considering ecological context when studying music processing and designing music-based interventions, as network connectivity patterns during music listening reflect complex interactions between task demands, attentional resources, and musical engagement rather than music processing alone.",

We used multilevel models that incorporated childhood predictors simultaneously, with each model examining one outcome at a time. Better childhood family experiences and more frequent religious engagement were generally associated with greater religious participation in adulthood. Having frequent conversations about faith with one’s parents in childhood showed the strongest associations with adulthood outcomes (e.g., more frequent RSA, faith transmission to one’s own children, more forgivingness), but all childhood factors were associated with at least one adulthood outcome. These findings highlight the potentially lasting and complex role of childhood experiences in shaping subsequent faith and relationships.",

Mother–child and father–child play interactions were recorded in the home.\nResults: We found no differences between mothers’ and fathers’ use of recodes. A moderate positive association existed between child receptive language and total combined recodes from mothers and fathers. A weak positive association was found for expressive language and mothers’ recodes. \nConclusions: Our preliminary findings highlight the need for further research into how mothers and fathers recode their children’s communicative acts in ways that support later language development.

          "abstract": "As the world globalizes, a greater volume of cross-cultural interactions produces more opportunities for cultural transmission across group lines. How do psychological processes shape this transmission of cultural information between groups? We examine how people’s perceptions of other nations shape their willingness to transmit cultural information from individuals in that nation to others within their own nation. Drawing on theories of prestige-based cultural transmission, we tested whether people were more likely to transmit cultural information from individuals whose countries are perceived as internationally influential. We also tested whether this effect was shaped by two theoretically motivated moderators: the domain of information shared by a model (instrumental vs. value-oriented), and perceived competition with the model’s country. Across four studies using correlational (Study 1) and experimental (Studies 2-4) methods, and across samples from both the United States and New Zealand (Study 4), we found consistent evidence that international influence increases transmission of instrumental—but not value-oriented—cultural information across national borders. The role of competition is less consistent, sometimes moderating the effect of influence (Study 1), sometimes independently increasing transmission of instrumental—but not value-oriented—cultural information (Studies 3 &amp; 4), and varying across countries (Study 4). Together, these results suggest that psychological processes may support the transmission of norms from globally influential nations, but that this effect may be critically bounded by the type of cultural information in question, with implications for how cultural norms, practices, and traditions may flow across borders and ultimately shape large-scale cultural change.",

          "abstract": "Optimal stopping problems provide a framework for studying decision-making under uncertainty, balancing the trade-off between information sampling and decision commitment. We investigated deviations from normative strategies in human decision-making and examined the neural mechanisms underlying decision commitment versus sampling using electroencephalography (EEG). Forty participants viewed sequences of beads drawn from fictitious urns and attempted to infer the majority bead colour in each urn, while their EEG activity was recorded. After viewing each bead, participants could choose to sample more by drawing another bead (draw choice) or to stop sampling and infer the contents of the urn (urn choice). A Bayesian ideal observer model and parametrised models were used to predict participant behaviour. Participants undersampled relative to the ideal observer, particularly in the more uncertain condition where the proportion of bead colours was close to chance (60/40 or 0.6), with the model better capturing behaviour in the easier 80/20 (0.8) condition. P300 amplitudes showed larger responses for urn choices and a gradient of increasing amplitude as draws approached commitment. Larger frontal ERP responses were also observed under higher uncertainty (0.6 condition). Beta oscillatory activity was stronger for urn choices in the high uncertainty condition, with fast beta (20–30 Hz) activity driving final commitment to a decision. Beta power was further predicted by model-derived action values. By integrating behavioural, computational, and neurophysiological data, this study advances our understanding of active information sampling versus decision commitment in reward-related probabilistic environments.",

The openness of empirical concepts suggests that this selectionist\nconstituting does not characterise only the early stages in the development of a science because background\nand foreground shifts are potentially ongoing. The theory of psychological construction, which contends that\nemotional episodes are constructed on the fly out of shifting sets of components, exemplifies this selectionist\nsense of constituting to the extent that it advocates for a resemblance nominalism, similar to that of Locke, in\nwhich selection is involved in naming kinds. Examples of constituting can be seen in changing definitions of\nwhether animals experience emotion and in the choice of causal models.",

          "abstract": "The Self-Objectification Beliefs and Behaviors Scale (SOBBS) was adapted to the Czech context using multiple independent translations and subsequent cognitive interviews. Data were collected from a non-random online sample of 548 participants, including 72% women and 27% men, aged 18–75 years (M = 25.8, SD = 10.1). The analysis supported the two-factor structure of the scale (i.e., body surveillance and body as self-representation), although the data favored the removal of one item. The SOBBS demonstrated high internal consistency (α = .87, ω = .90 for the total scale; α = .87, ω = .87 for body self-monitoring; and α = .83, ω = .83 for body as a representation of the Self), and correlations with body shame and body self-monitoring scales provided evidence for concurrent validity. Measurement invariance was supported at the level of the parallel model, allowing for gender-based comparisons. The main analysis revealed a statistically significant but small difference in overall self-objectification between women and men (d = 0.22). An exploratory analysis showed a higher body surveillance in women (d = 0.48), with no significant differences in the body as a self-representation dimension. The Czech version of the SOBBS thus represents a valid and reliable instrument for further research on self-objectification in the Czech context. We conclude with suggestions for future research, mainly wording revisions and clarifications for the conceptual placement of body shame within the Objectification Theory (Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997).",

          "authors": "Camila Valenzuela-Moguillansky",
          "abstract": "This article proposes a contemplative research framework—the Multidimensional Approach to Presence (MAP)—for the scientific study of lived experience. Building on micro-phenomenological research, the proposal examines how cultivating presence –inhabiting one’s lived experience as it unfolds– can be integrated methodologically and epistemologically into experiential inquiry. Drawing on studies of pain and bodily awareness, it analyzes three moments in the generation of experiential knowledge: contact with experience, the description of experience, and the analysis of descriptions. From an enactive perspective that conceives experience as dynamic, self-referential, and transformative, the discussion addresses the strengths and limitations of the method, particularly regarding evocation and memory, dimensions of lived experience that exceed declarative language, and the intersubjective character of knowledge generation. MAP places the cultivation of presence at the core of the investigative process and operates on two levels: methodologically, by integrating tools that foster familiarity with bodily experience—such as micro-phenomenological interviewing, somatic practices, and artistic expression—and epistemologically, by contending that investigating experience requires transforming modes of knowing and thereby opening a process of self-transformation. In this way, the article highlights the need to broaden the methodological and epistemological repertoire of cognitive science, paving the way for a science of experience consistent with the very nature of what it seeks to investigate.",

          "authors": "Niyati Kachhiyapatel; Igor Grossmann",
          "abstract": "How can one bring wisdom into STEM education? One popular position holds that wise judgment follows from teaching morals and ethics in STEM. However, wisdom scholars debate the causal role of morality and whether presence of a moral blueprint is a necessary condition for cultivating and expressing wisdom. Some philosophers and education scientists champion this view, whereas social psychologists and cognitive scientists argue that moral features like prosocial behavior are reinforcing factors or outcomes of wise judgment rather than pre-requisites. This debate matters particularly for science and technology, where wisdom-demanding decisions typically involve incommensurable values and radical uncertainty. Here, we evaluate these competing positions through four lines of evidence. First, empirical research shows that heightened moralization aligns with foolish rejection of scientific claims, political polarization, and value extremism. Second, economic scholarship on folk theorems demonstrates that wisdom-related metacognition—perspective-integration, context-sensitivity, and balancing long- and short-term goals—can give rise to prosocial behavior without an apriori moral blueprint. Third, in real life moral values often compete, making metacognition indispensable to balance competing interests for the common good. Fourth, numerous scientific tasks require wise handling of ill-defined challenges, without a clear role of morals for such tasks. We address potential objections about immoral and Machiavellian applications of blueprint-free wisdom accounts. Finally, we explore implications for giftedness: what exceptional wisdom looks like in STEM context, and how to train it in the classroom via self-reflection exercises and exercises that highlight one’s knowledge gaps.",

          "abstract": "The sexuality of older people in long-term residential care remains a taboo topic, often met with uncertainty and prejudice among care staff. Many facilities lack clear guidelines and training, leading to restrictions on residents' sexual self-determination. Professionalization in this area can be improved through targeted education. This study investigates the effects of a profession-specific workshop on handling sexuality in long-term care. Using a pre-post mixed-methods design, 27 nursing staff members were surveyed before and after the workshop with a psychometric questionnaire (BS-SWE). Additionally, qualitative data was gathered through observations and content analysis. Findings show varied responses to the topic: some staff engaged openly, while others found it uncomfortable. Challenges included dealing with assaultive behavior, cultural differences, and ethical concerns. Participants emphasized the need for further training, increased privacy for residents, and better documentation of incidents. Quantitative results revealed a significant increase (p &lt; .001, d = .865) in job-specific self-efficacy expectations, shifting from a lower to an upper average range compared to norm values. Since sexual issues frequently arise in nursing care, systematic preparation and destigmatization are essential for professional practice. Sexual psychology workshops effectively enhance self-efficacy, though ethical issues such as documentation and sexually transmitted diseases require further attention.",

          "abstract": "Perceptual load theory (Forster &amp; Lavie, 2008) is a key framework in visual attention research, demonstrating that under high-load conditions, fully irrelevant distractors are no longer processed and do not disrupt task performance. In our recent work (Manini et al., 2025), we replicated this effect. However, we also found that under high load, the distractor not only failed to impair performance but actually led to faster reaction times (RTs) in distractor-present trials. In the broader attentional capture literature, this reversed effect is typically considered to reflect distractor suppression. However, in the perceptual load task, where the distractor is placed outside the relevant search array, suppression should not logically lead to faster responses.  Furthermore, the faster responses were accompanied by increased error rates, leading us to hypothesize that this reversed effect reflects spatially controlled attentional capture rather than distractor suppression. Specifically, the distractor may alert the attentional system, accelerating responses, while attention moving to its position remains somehow controlled, as the distractor is never the target. To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed the consistency of this effect across all available open-data resources using the Forster and Lavie (2008) task. We then reanalyzed the same data, incorporating the spatial proximity between target and distractor, observing that trials with the distractor near the target strongly drove the reversed RT effect, while trials with the distractor far from the target led to increased error rates. These findings challenge the idea that high perceptual load prevents attentional capture by irrelevant stimuli. Moreover, they suggest that faster RTs in distractor-present conditions do not necessarily indicate distractor suppression, as commonly assumed in attentional capture research, giving new insight into the interpretation of this reversed effect.",

Since 2018, gender-neutral/sensitive wording has been required in job advertisements (Antidiskriminierungsstelle des Bundes, 2024). The study examines whether gender sensitivity in this context is related to the skills and personality traits of employees and to what extent gender sensitivity is implemented in German-language job advertisements.\nMethod: Following a explorative cross-sectional study with a mixed-methods research design was conducted. The gender sensitivity, diversity competence and personality traits of test persons (N = 44) were correlated and the implementation of the \"TransVisible\" recommendations (2020) for the formulation of 60 job advertisements from a big data dataset from 2024 was analyzed.\nResults: There were correlations between gender sensitivity and diversity competence as well as diversity competence and openness among the respondents who are professionally involved with job advertisements. In addition, the implementation of gender sensitivity in German-language job advertisements could be characterized. For example, there are differences with regard to different professions and federal states. It was also found that there are still considerable deficits in the implementation of gender sensitivity in the German-language job advertisement market.",

We investigated the influence of the connectivity of words in the child’s lexicon (preferential attachment), the child’s environment (preferential acquisition), or between novel and known words (lure of associates) in the development of early phonological and semantic networks, using longitudinal data from 17-to-36-month-old Norwegian children. We compared the extent to which the different scenarios predicted individual children’s lexical\nacquisition whilst also examining the joint influence of form and meaning on vocabulary growth. Our results revealed a ‘rich?get-richer’ pattern whereby semantically well-connected words in children’s existing lexicons best predicted the likelihood of a word entering the lexicon earlier. Phonological connectivity tended to impede word learning, with leveraging effects only in early development when semantic connectivity was low. Our findings imply that words are learned more easily when they\nare similar to many words in meaning, but not, necessarily, in form. Furthermore, relative to previous studies examining the influence of phonological connectivity on word learning, our study highlights the importance of considering the interplay between semantics and phonology and accounting for individual\ndifferences in vocabulary development.",

          "abstract": "Social exclusion has been linked to increased risk for psychotic experiences; however, it remains unclear whether exclusion has a unique impact beyond general negative experiences. Across two studies run between April 2024 and May 2024, we tested whether recalling autobiographical experiences of exclusion leads to greater increases in psychotic experiences compared to recalling other negatively valenced experiences (i.e., sadness) using a within-subjects design and a novel momentary self-report measure. Participants completed the Momentary Assessment of Psychotic Experiences (MAPE) immediately before and after a five-minute recall task, during which they were randomly assigned to recall an experience of exclusion, sadness, inclusion, or a neutral event. Study 1 (N = 810) found that neither the exclusion nor sadness induction increased positive symptoms. Both conditions led to increased negative symptoms but did not differ significantly from each other. Study 2 (N = 836) replicated these findings in an independent sample. Across both studies, inclusion unexpectedly led to a reduction in negative symptoms, including amotivation and anhedonia, and social anhedonia. These findings suggest that exclusion contributes to short-term increases in psychotic experiences that reflect negative symptoms, but its effects are not distinguishable from other negatively valenced life experiences. In contrast, inclusion may have a protective effect, reducing specific negative symptoms. Together, these findings highlight the need to consider both negative and positive life experiences when evaluating social risk and protective factors for psychotic experiences.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Neurocognitive ability (NCA) deteriorates with increasing age, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in midlife is a major risk factor for the later development of dementia. This study aimed to assess the neurocognitive status of middle-aged individuals in an industrialized area and to examine associations with demographic and lifestyle factors that may contribute to cognitive vulnerability.\nMethods: Ninety-four participants (27 males and 67 females), aged 40–65 years (mean age = 50), were recruited. NCA was assessed using the Bangla version of the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III).\nResults: The mean overall NCA score was 67.5, which falls below the cutoff point. The prevalence of MCI was 60%. Significant risk factors (p&lt;0.05) associated with MCI included age, sex, educational attainment, and low levels of physical activity.\nConclusions: Findings suggest that middle-aged individuals living in an industrialized city are in a vulnerable position regarding neurocognitive health. A substantial proportion are already experiencing MCI, placing them at elevated risk of progressing to dementia in later life. Targeted interventions addressing lifestyle and environmental risk factors are urgently needed to mitigate this risk.",

          "authors": "Henri Scott Chastain; A. David Redish",
          "abstract": "The ‘common currency’ hypothesis proposes that selecting between choices requires a centralized neural representation of value which combines the attributes of choice into a single metric of comparison. Conversely, the multiple decision-making systems theory posits competing decision-making algorithms that separately identify actions to take. These two theories have increasingly become central to how neuroscientists understand decision-making. However, these theories appear incompatible with each other, at least on the surface. This Perspective addresses how these theories interact with each other and points to unanswered questions about the intricacies of action selection. We find that it is unlikely that a single common currency arbitrates between decision systems, but that some algorithms can be described as containing a common currency mechanism. However, others are unlikely to be compatible with a common currency hypothesis. We also find that computational differences between individual common currency representations may have measurable effects neurophysiologically and behaviorally.",

          "abstract": "Moral motivation, the translation of moral judgments into actions, can result from many different processes including deliberate reasoning, emotional responses, and social pressures. Across existing literature, moral motivation is neither concretely defined nor consistently conceptualized, but instead attributed to diverse sources across disciplines. The objectives of this scoping review are to synthesize and examine how moral motivations are defined across the literature, how methodologies are used to study moral motivations, which populations the literature has examined, which cognitive mechanisms and moral domains are implicated in moral motivation, which theoretical frameworks and models are used to interpret findings, and where further research is needed to fill gaps in the current literature. An iterative approach to searching scholarly databases will be conducted using various search terms (e.g. “moral drive*”) in addition to “moral motiv*” to examine moral motivations and related terminologies that may be related or describe the same processes. Studies will be included if moral motivations or related terms are specifically addressed or measured. Studies will be excluded if they address moral motivations in a metaphorical or non-moral sense, as well as if they address moral motivation in contexts unrelated to psychology. A structured charting form was created to systematically extract data from the relevant literature. The main outcome will simply be a mapping of the literature on the topic. As a result, this scoping review will synthesize the widely dispersed accounts of moral motivation and inform the development of new frameworks and future research.",

          "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder is associated with severe suffering and insomnia disorder. The study aimed to explore the association between self-reported physical activity and the symptoms of borderline personality disorder with the severity of insomnia disorder acting as a mediator. The indirect relationship within the mediation analysis (n = 54) is not significant (β = 0.0503 [-0.1050 – 0.2250]). Furthermore, physical activity is not significantly associated with insomnia disorder (β = 0.0001 [-0.003 – 0.0005]). However, insomnia disorder is significantly associated with borderline personality disorder (β = 0.5601 [0.3006 – 0.8738]). Additionally, the direct mediating (β = 0.0003 [-0.0000 – 0.0007]) and total relationship (β = 0.0004 [-0.0000 – 0.0008]) independently of the mediation analysis between physical activity and borderline personality disorder show statistical trends. Accordingly, insomnia disorder does not appear to affect the relationship between physical activity and borderline personality disorder. However, insomnia disorder seems to be positively and potentially physical activity negatively related with the symptoms of borderline personality disorder in direct ways. Further studies should investigate the relationship between physical activity, insomnia disorder, and borderline personality disorder.",

Music-making in particular sets perceptions into motion that both creator and appreciator can experience. This establishes one’s identity within the community, and further emphasizes one’s voice within the collective. Group-based music-making’s ability to foster agency and belonging might be especially advantageous for those experiencing psychosis. \nMethods: Twenty participants with psychosis engaged in four sessions during which they wrote and recorded songs with four other participants and a music facilitator. This study builds on music therapy research in psychosis by incorporating symptom specific measures and adding linguistic analyses as objective measures of mental states. Symptom changes were assessed by administering paranoia and hallucination questionnaires before and after the music intervention. Fluctuations in the language participants use to describe experiences were quantitatively captured using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count 2022. \nStudy Results: Although a decrease in hallucinations was not observed, paranoia decreased in participants who experience less severe hallucinations as compared to those who experience them more frequently. Linguistic findings revealed a significant reduction in the usage of the first-person pronoun “I” and significant increases in the plural pronoun “we,” accomplishment, agentic, cognitive processing, and positive emotion language. \nStudy Conclusion: Suggestions regarding how these language shifts reflect the song-making activity and translate into participants’ lives outside of the song-writing workshop are discussed. Overall, this study highlights the potential of group-based song-making in promoting recovery from psychosis.",

          "abstract": "The sense of presence and the sense of reality are often treated as distinct phenomena—presence as the feeling of \"being there\" in a virtual environment and reality as the ability to discern ‘real’ from ‘false’ phenomena. We argue that these concepts are identical  both conceptually and mechanistically, despite much VR research defining presence as something which much necessarily take place in VR. We then introduce specific instances of converging evidence between the fields, suggesting that presence and reality are likely to be constituted by the same integrative theoretical models, psychophysical mechanisms and neural architecture. Evidence from neuroimaging supports this claim, revealing overlapping brain regions involved in both presence and reality perception. This reconceptualization of VR presence as reality has implications  for research on consciousness, psychiatric disorders involving reality perception, and the use of virtual reality as a tool for studying and modifying perceptual experience. Future research should directly compare presence and reality mechanisms to explore their functional and neural equivalence, potentially redefining how we study consciousness and perception.",

          "abstract": "The gambling industry tends to frame gambling harms as a matter of personal responsibility, which is implicit in their messages like “gamble responsibly” or “take time to think”. Jurisdictions such as Australia and the UK are replacing industry messages with a range of independently-designed ones, like in tobacco warning labels. Counter-industry messages have been proposed to challenge industry narratives, e.g., “gambling products are designed to be addictive”. Here we tested 10 potential counter-industry messages among UK gamblers (N=4,269) using a mixed-methods approach. Results showed that the three best-performing messages came from existing counter-industry campaigns. Participants believed the messages, and agreed that they were relevant to people experiencing gambling harm. Participants experiencing higher levels of gambling harm tended to see the messages as more personally relevant to them. Free-text analysis showed that “gambling products are designed to be addictive” received the most positive responses, and also that personal responsibility views were widespread among participants. Messages randomly shown later in the experiment were appraised more positively, suggesting that counter-industry messaging may become more effective when its core message is repeated in multiple ways. Continual design and testing will contribute to the development of best approaches and inform future implementation.",

To this end, we discuss reproducibility-related challenges of synthetic data and outline different approaches for generating synthetic data, including conventional and data-augmented MI (DA-MI) approaches to synthetic data. Furthermore, we conducted a case study using data from the PISA 2018 study, in which we aimed to address several challenges with synthetic data in educational research, such as missing data, multilevel data, and complex sampling designs. Our results indicate that these challenges can be addressed with relatively simple tools and that synthetic data can reproduce the results in a variety of statistical analyses.

          "abstract": "Modern neuroscience research faces critical computational bottlenecks. Neural recording\ntechnology advances allow for increasingly large, multidimensional datasets which contain\nnon-stationary signals and complex nonlinear interactions across multiple spatiotemporal\nscales. At the same time, classical computing approaches are reaching their physical\nlimitations. The convergence of these two factors creates an urgent need for alternative\ncomputational approaches. Here, we argue that quantum computing offers transformative\nsolutions in three different ways. First, quantum algorithms and their implementation on\nquantum computing hardware can reveal novel neural features, including subtle dynamics and\nemergent network properties, that remain computationally inaccessible to classical methods.\nIndeed, recent findings in other scientific fields have already uncovered properties that\nclassical approaches have failed to capture. Second, quantum systems provide exponential\nscaling advantages for analyzing high-dimensional neural data. This includes demonstrated\nsignificant speedups for network state evaluation and exponentially improved efficiency in\ndetecting correlations across sparse, noisy datasets which are typical of neuroscience\nresearch. Third, quantum formalism offers alternative mathematical frameworks for understanding neural information processing. These frameworks better account for context-\ndependence, probabilistic dynamics, and multi-pathway causation than classical deterministic\nmodels. While current pre-fault tolerant devices face limitations in scalability and decoherence,\ndeveloping hybrid quantum-classical approaches already show practical advantages in other\nareas of research. Therefore, beyond computational speedups, quantum approaches may\nfundamentally transform how we understand activity in the brain, neural information\nprocessing, and the resulting cognitive phenomena.",

Our preregistered study\naimed to investigate the relationship between cognitive and affective empathy and alcohol\nconsumption in late adolescence. Building on prior research, we predicted a dissociation of\ncognitive and affective empathy related to alcohol consumption. Specifically, we hypothesized\nthat whereas a negative association between affective empathy and alcohol consumption would\nemerge, no significant association would be observed for cognitive empathy. To test these\nhypotheses, we surveyed a convenience sample of U.S. college students (N = 116; ages 18-23;\n73.28 % women). The online survey comprised questions assessing drinking behavior\n(categorized as non-binge drinking, binge drinking, and extreme binge drinking), engagement in\nhazardous drinking behavior (continuous measure), and self-reported empathic traits.\nWe found that binge drinking categories and hazardous drinking scores were closely\naligned, suggesting that the two measures capture similar aspects of drinking behavior. Men\nreported more problematic drinking patterns than women, who also tended to show higher\naffective empathy. Age was positively related to hazardous drinking, with participants at the\nupper end of the age range reporting riskier alcohol use. Contrary to our preregistered\nhypotheses, we found no significant relationship between affective empathy and engagement in\nbinge drinking or hazardous drinking among late adolescents. Cognitive empathy, as predicted,\nwas not related to the extremity of alcohol consumption. Additionally, we observed a striking\npattern in our data: 20.69 % of our sample indicated extreme binge drinking (EBD), which is\nsignificantly higher than the 12% reported by a U.S. national survey conducted in 2020. While\nthe relationship between drinking behavior and empathy may be more nuanced than expected,\nthe observed disparity in EBD behavior emphasizes the importance of addressing its prevalence\nwithin U.S. college communities and implementing proactive measures to promote responsible\nalcohol consumption during late adolescence.",

The extent and causes of this suboptimality, however, remain poorly understood. Combining a novel Bayesian modeling approach with experimental data, we show that individuals adjust their reliance on advice based on the cognitive and metacognitive profiles of artificial advisers, and that advice generally improves performance. Nevertheless, decision-makers display systematic biases: they overweight self-generated judgments and confidence, and misapply knowledge of metacognitive skills by inconsistently translating global traits into local decisions. Strikingly, these biases persist even when both self and adviser attributes are fully transparent. Our findings reveal fundamental bottlenecks in advice integration, not stemming from ignorance, but from biased information processing. By identifying these limits, this work highlights concrete pathways for enhancing collaboration in human–human and human–AI decision-making.",

However, factors such as how math anxiety is operationalized, the specific mathematical domain, gender, and cultural context may influence this relationship. Still, these factors have not been considered together and the results in primary school students have been inconsistent. Thus, this study aimed to investigate how math anxiety is related to arithmetic fluency and number processing in fourth-grade students across three cultural contexts (Finnish- and Swedish-speaking students from Finland and Swedish-speaking students from Sweden). In addition, we investigated the dimensionality of math anxiety (i.e., cognitive and affective dimensions) and gender differences in the level of and relations between math anxiety and mathematics performance. The sample included 1022 fourth-grade students (52.6% girls) from Finland and Sweden. The participants completed a survey measuring their math anxiety and a mathematics performance test (arithmetic fluency and number processing). Confirmatory factor analysis supported a two-dimensional math anxiety construct for the Finnish-speaking sample and a unidimensional math anxiety construct for the Swedish-speaking samples. The negative math anxiety–performance relationship was demonstrated in each sample, showing a slightly stronger association for arithmetic fluency than number processing. On average girls experienced higher levels of math anxiety and boys had better arithmetic fluency. The negative relationship between math anxiety and mathematics performance, especially for number processing, was stronger for boys. The results highlight the relationships between math anxiety and mathematics performance in fourth-grade students in Finland and Sweden.

          "abstract": "This study addresses the potential benefits of eye-tracking to assess the relationship between people’s presuppositions about how liars behave and where people actually look when making deception judgements, and how these presuppositions and looking behaviours are related to judgement accuracy. Participants (N = 68) took on the role of either interviewer or observer in a 2×2 between-subjects design (face-to-face vs. video; active vs. passive role). Gaze data were collected using Tobii Pro Glasses 2 and mapped to predefined facial and bodily areas of interest, e.g. arms and hands, eyes and brows, forehead. Participants’ beliefs about nonverbal deception cues (e.g., gaze aversion, blinking, fidgeting) were collected via questionnaire. Veracity judgments were assessed using both direct ratings and indirect (intuitive) measures. The preliminary findings suggested that looking more often at someone’s legs and feet associated with more accurate deception judgements than when these areas were looked at less often. Looking at the forehead more often leads to lower deception judgement accuracy. Interestingly, while certain presuppositions about deception, such as the belief that liars avoid eye contact, were reflected in participants’ gaze behaviour (e.g., spending more time looking at the eyes), these beliefs and gaze behaviour did not translate into higher judgement accuracy. Looking the deceiver more in their eyes did not predict accuracy.  Instead, even when gaze behaviour aligned with such presuppositions, it offered no advantage in detecting deception and often had no predictive value for veracity judgments. Our findings demonstrate a new method for directly testing theoretical associations between people’s beliefs about deception and their actual behaviour when making judgements. Tentatively, our preliminary findings support theories that suggest nonconscious and indirect deception judgements are more accurate than direct deception judgements, due to people attending to unreliable cues to deception, such as eye contact, when making direct judgements.",

          "abstract": "Amidst escalating global environmental crises, understanding the psychological factors driving pro-environmental action is crucial. We argue that stewarding the Earth System away from instability requires an embrace of expansive perspectives that drive effective action. Past perspectives underscore the importance of ‘expansiveness’ for prosocial behaviour, including both a more inclusive moral universe and an extended self-concept. Across two studies (N = 546), assessed via the well-established Moral Expansiveness Scale (MES), and identification processes. Specifically, we employed a tailored version of the MES to scrutinize self-identity and its relative expansiveness. Study 1 revealed a significant relationship between moral concern and self-expansion, yet each exhibited distinct patterns, displaying discriminant validity. The degree of identification with an entity, especially nature-related ones, related to moral concern judgments associated with it, offering fresh insights into moral expansiveness. In Study 2, individuals demonstrating broader and deeper moral circles, alongside a more inclusive self-concept, exhibited heightened tendencies to identify as environmental activists and engage in pro-environmental activism. However, neither construct predicted signing the Climate and Ecology Bill, indicating the need for further investigation into factors influencing pro-environmental behaviour. This paper extends research into environmental activism by examining the unique contribution of expansiveness in moral circles and the self-concept, shedding light on individuals' prosocial engagement with the natural world.",

Here we survey participants in a convenience sample (n=187) and then in a pre-registered representative national-population sample (n=402). We find that participants were indeed greatly distressed at losing access to GPS, with negative initial and follow-up emotional reactions. Users reported turning to strategies such as route memorization or offline maps, and limiting their driving to new places. However they still continued to rely on GPS for navigation. This natural experiment, which hopefully will not repeat itself, offers a unique window into the effects of GPS navigation on human spatial capabilities and perceptions on a society level, with implications for spatial cognition theories, human navigation and societal preparedness for GPS disruptions.",

We investigated pattern relationships using their derived principal component, ‘Music Perception skill’, in line with the construction paradigm to understand how feature-based discrimination defines music perception and is modulated by the nature and duration of musical training (N=82). A heterogeneous group of participants including trained musicians and non-musicians performed Mini-PROMS. The Tempo discrimination threshold was found to be low resulting in a ceiling effect for the entire sample. Musically trained individuals performed better on the tuning sub-test compared to non-musicians. Further, music perception was found to be less informed by recognition of melodic deviations and most informed by deviations in tempo for those with no musical training. However, with short-term training, music perception was most informed by discrimination ability for tuning. For musicians trained in Indian instruments, it was the temporal features whereas for those trained in western instruments, the tonal (melody) features largely contributed to their music perception skill. We also examined the effect of duration and nature of training (training in Indian vs western instruments) highlighting the enculturation of music perception skills for both musically trained and untrained individuals.",

Active repetition, on the other hand, slightly impaired it. In 9-year-olds, active repetition also impaired performance, but free time provided little benefit. These findings demonstrate that providing more free time during instruction delivery improves performance in young adults but is far less effective in children, suggesting important developmental differences in the short-term maintenance of instructions and the (strategic) use of free time.",

          "abstract": "Episodic memory is shaped by event segmentation, which divides continuous experience into discrete episodes often marked by temporal gaps. Emotional learning can influence memory across these boundaries by prioritizing not only threatening events but also related information that is encoded shortly before or after the emotional episode, which in turn supports adaptive generalization. However, evidence for such cross-boundary modulation is mixed, possibly because conventional group-level analyses can mask systematic individual variability in the effects of emotional learning on nearby neutral memories.\n  \nWe reanalyzed data from a large-sample study (N = 285) combining emotional and episodic learning that had previously shown no consistent retroactive or proactive enhancement across event boundaries at the group level. Young adults incidentally encoded neutral images from two categories (animals, tools) across three temporally separated phases: pre-conditioning, conditioning, and post-conditioning. One category was partially reinforced with mild electric shocks during conditioning to create a category-level threat association. Memory was tested 24 hours later using a surprise old–new recognition task.\n\nA hierarchical Bayesian recognition model with a latent-mixture component revealed two profiles of memory modulation. One showed declining memory across phases, with modest enhancement limited to items from the shock-predictive category encoded during conditioning. The other showed strongest memory for items encoded during conditioning, with substantial category-selective enhancement extending into post-conditioning. These findings suggest that proactive, but not retroactive, enhancement is most evident in individuals whose memories are strongly anchored to the emotional episode, indicating integration of threat-related information across temporal boundaries.",

          "abstract": "Conscious awareness of actions is known to support the acquisition and skilled execution of motor skills, but its contribution to memory consolidation following initial learning remains unknown. In two experiments, we investigated the role of subjective action awareness within a dual-process framework of consolidation, distinguishing between memory improvement and stabilization. Participants practiced a motor-sequence task under action-awareness or yoked-control conditions, followed by 24-hour delayed retention and sequence-knowledge tests. In Experiment 1, individual levels of action awareness were positively correlated with delayed performance gains, suggesting a link to memory improvement mechanisms. In Experiment 2, action awareness heightened susceptibility to interference from competing learning, suggesting reduced memory stabilization. Findings reveal that conscious awareness of actions has a dual effect, enhancing early learning and differentially modulating consolidation pathways. Our results demonstrate that conscious awareness of actions shapes motor skill encoding and consolidation, thus highlighting the role of metacognitive processes in motor memory formation.",

While these debates have generated valuable insights, they have proceeded in parallel, without a systematic framework for understanding their relationships and implications. We contend that these parallel disputes reflect deeper, unresolved tensions in conceptualizing consciousness. These debates can be addressed by recognizing three fundamental dimensions that encompass models of consciousness at a meta-theoretical level: perspectives, scope, and explanatory medium. Along these dimensions, we show how clusters of extrinsic-local-functional and intrinsic-universal-structural approaches naturally emerge, transforming theoretical conflicts into tractable disagreements about dimensional priorities and offering new pathways for empirical investigation.",

          "abstract": "Musicians convey different timing ‘feels’ in groove-based performance by manipulating onset asynchrony between instruments (playing ahead/on/behind the beat) and the durational ratio of metrical subdivisions (non-isochrony, or ‘swing’). The present study asked whether listeners per-ceive such fine-grained timing deviations, which place demands on perceptual grouping, attention-al allocation, and temporal prediction, in complex, multi-instrumental groove contexts. We meas-ured just-noticeable difference (JND) thresholds of asynchrony and swing in a naturalistic funk pattern featuring guitar, bass, and drums (kick, snare, hi-hat). Sixty-four participants (32 musicians, 32 non-musicians) completed a 1IFC staircase task with uniform onset displacements (asynchrony: ±1–100 ms; swing: +1–71.5 ms). Pupillary responses were recorded throughout. These have been shown to index attentional allocation and sensory conflict, offering a useful physiological comple-ment to behavioral measures of microrhythm. Thresholds varied systematically by instrument: for asynchrony, Kick, Snare, and Hi-hat yielded the lowest JNDs (≈19–24ms), while Bass and Guitar required the largest displacements (≈31–35ms). For swing, thresholds were lowest when Drums or All Instruments swung together (≈24–26ms), and highest for Bass and Guitar (≈32–34ms). An asymmetric effect of temporal direction was found, with late displacements (≈28ms) harder to de-tect than early ones (≈23ms).  Musical training generally conferred lower thresholds. We also found a linear relationship between pupil size and both asynchrony and non-isochrony, further in-dicating that the pupil indexes saliency in the processing of microrhythm.  The findings expand our understanding of perceptual boundaries for microrhythmic expression in multi-layered groove mu-sic and highlight how both acoustic and experiential factors shape sensitivity to timing nuances.",

          "authors": "Johan Hennert; Dario Paape; Himanshu Yadav; Shravan Vasishth",
          "abstract": "A signature prediction of memory-based theories of sentence processing is that processing difficulty should increase with increased dependency distance. However, in addition to this so-called locality effect, an anti-locality effect has also been reported, where increased dependency distance leads to a reduction in processing difficulty. Anti-locality effects are a key prediction of expectation-based accounts; these accounts predict that increasing dependency distance can make the upcoming word more predictable, and therefore easier to process. A theory that has been argued to explain both locality and anti-locality effects within a unified framework is lossy-context (LC) surprisal (Futrell, R., Gibson, E., &amp; Levy, R. P. (2021). Lossy-context surprisal: An information-theoretic model of memory effects in sentence processing. Cognitive Science, 44(3)). LC surprisal extends the expectation-based account with a memory component that lets memory for the linguistic context degrade and be reconstructed, and this affects the surprisal computation. Locality or anti-locality effects can arise depending on how much the context has degraded, and how it is reconstructed. Although this claim has been investigated by Futrell and colleagues using data from English and German, it has not been put to the test against other cross-linguistic experimental data in which both memory and expectation effects are in play. We present an evaluation of LC surprisal theory against three empirical studies involving Russian, Hindi, and Persian, which found evidence for both memory- and expectation-based effects. We show that the lossy-context surprisal model as laid out in Futrell et al. (2021) has only limited success in explaining the observed patterns in these data. Alternative implementations of LC surprisal need to be developed that align better with the observed data.",

In response, analyses of social media (SM) language have gained prominence due to their high temporal resolution and longitudinal scope. Here, we introduce a method to determine the timing of users’ diagnoses and apply it to study language trajectories from 3 years before to 21 years after BD diagnosis - contrasted with uses reporting unipolar depression (UD) and non-affected users (HC). We show that BD diagnosis is accompanied by pervasive linguistic alterations reflecting mood disturbance, psychiatric comorbidity, substance abuse, hospitalization, medical comorbidities, unusual thought content, and disorganized thought. We further observe recurring mood-related language changes across two decades after the diagnosis, with a pronounced 12-month periodicity suggestive of seasonal mood episodes. Finally, trend-level evidence suggests an increased periodicity in users estimated to be female. In sum, our findings provide evidence for language alterations in the acute and chronic phase of BD. This validates and extends recent efforts leveraging SM for scalable monitoring of mental health.",

Leveraging a deep mobile event log and experience sampling dataset of German Internet users (N = 889), we probe the situational dynamics of smartphone habits. We investigate how moment-to-moment smartphone behavior corresponds to the perception of automaticity, with implications for the measurement of habitual behavior more generally. Contrary to expectations, duration – rather than frequency – of smartphone behavior emerged as the more consistent predictor of situational habit perception at both within- and between-person levels. However, these links varied by the type of behavior, with sessions and episodes (but not glances) relating to perceived automaticity. Additionally, home screen and gateway app use were not associated with perceived automaticity. Our results generate new insights – and deep questions – into the nature of real-world media habits.",

          "abstract": "Objective: To highlight lived experiences of Visual Snow Syndrome, and characterize its impacts on daily life. \n\nBackground: Visual Snow Syndrome (VSS) is neurological condition typified by persistent visual snow, or static throughout the visual field, alongside additional phenomena that impact night vision, visual perception, and visual processing. Only formally characterized in the last decade, little consideration has been given to the broader impacts of this condition on the lives of those who experience it. This study presents the first qualitative investigation of the subjective experience of Visual Snow Syndrome, to further inform clinical, research, and consumer communities alike. \n\nMethods: Forty-nine adults who self-identified as having Visual Snow Syndrome completed an online survey that queried the good and bad aspects of VSS, and its general impact on their daily life. Their qualitative data were analysed iteratively, to determine the key themes represented across and between individual responses. \n\nResults: The lived experience of VSS varied both inter and intra-individually across this sample. Responses endorsed several themes, related to mental health and psychosocial wellbeing, functional vision, the dynamic course of visual snow syndrome, clinical challenges, and medical system limitations. The majority of participants described their VSS as a negative component of their daily life, with impacts to mental health and psychosocial wellbeing, and functional vision the most commonly endorsed themes. Specifically, participants described how living with VSS worsened their mental health, cognition, sleep, daily routines, visual quality, and comfort in both natural and artificial light. However, one third of participants were able to identify some positive aspects of their visual snow experience, highlighting that it can bring unique meaning and fascination to their lives. \n\nConclusion: VSS has broad and varied impacts on the day-to-day lives of those who experience it. It can introduce substantial mental health and psychosocial wellbeing challenges and functional vision impairments, but also a unique, and sometimes beautiful perspective. These experiences, paired with its variability between and within persons, indicates a need for more holistic and individualised approaches to the long-term treatment and support of people living with Visual Snow Syndrome.",

Addressing two postulates—that we live in a four-dimensional block universe where all moments are embedded within spacetime, and that conscious experience of the present moment is real—in this essay, the multitrack consciousness conjecture (MCC) is advanced as a solution for this paradox. This conjecture suggests the existence of multiple identical instances of our conscious selves in time, each one only being capable of experiencing a single moving now. The implications of the MCC for self-identity, emotion, memory, and shared experiences are discussed within the block universe framework and in more heterodox physical scenarios. The MCC offers a new perspective on the relations among the subjective nature of time, consciousness and the structure of events in spacetime.",

          "abstract": "Successful teamwork depends on interpersonal dynamics, the ways in which individuals coordinate, influence, and adapt to one another over time. Existing measures of interpersonal dynamics, such as CRQA, correlation, Granger causality, and transfer entropy, typically capture only a single dimension: either the synchrony/coordination or the direction of influence between individuals. What is missing is a psychologically meaningful representation that unifies these dimensions and varies systematically with behavior. We propose the context matrix as one such representation. The context matrix is the transition matrix in a linear dynamical system, with entries specifying how much each individual’s current behavior is attributable to their own versus every other group member’s past behaviors. Its values can be distilled into psychologically interpretable summary features of synchrony and directional influence. Evidence for the context matrix as psychologically meaningful is provided in two steps. First, we develop a sequential Bayesian model that infers context matrices from timeseries data and show that it accurately recovers them in noisy simulations. Second, applying the model to human eyetracking data, we show that summary features of the inferred context matrices capture expected task-based differences in interpersonal dynamics (or lack thereof), predict task accuracy in psychologically reasonable ways, and show some correspondence with existing measures (CRQA and Granger causality). We conclude by situating the context matrix within a broader agenda for modeling interpersonal dynamics.",

Each dimension of sensitivity was significantly correlated with other measures of personality. These correlations were not so large as to suggest redundancy between measures. Further, sensitivity to emotional and physiological stimuli was related to the ways people changed expressions of narrative processing between the construction of positive-valence and negative-valence life stories.

Drawing on participant observation during the 2025 election season, we show that legitimacy at the grassroots hinged less on institutional reforms than on fragile performances of recognition, care, and reciprocity. Residents judged leaders through culturally resonant idioms like malasakit (concern), pagpapakita (visible presence), and loob (moral intent), evaluating sincerity and intent in everyday encounters. We conceptualize these dynamics as mutual recognition, moralized care, and the fragility of reciprocity, extending debates on trust, legitimacy, and affective governance. While reformist politics reshaped expectations and closed off older forms of patronage, they did not displace the cultural grammars of recognition through which authority is continually made and unmade. Authority in Pasig was therefore both durable and reversible, highlighting reciprocity as a constitutive feature of Philippine democracy.",

This dynamic emerges from everyday practices including editorial gatekeeping, strategic citation, and metrics that substitute institutional prestige for substantive judgment.

          "authors": "Ishan Durve",
          "abstract": "As global retirement ages rise in response to financial insecurity, demographic shifts, and increased life expectancy, questions emerge about how these changes affect the quality of later life. While much research has focused on the economic sustainability of delayed retirement, fewer studies have examined whether retiring at or after the statutory age impacts subjective well-being in comparison to early retirement. This study addresses that gap by investigating whether retirement timing, specifically early versus at statutory-age, shapes quality of life in later years. Using cross-sectional data from Wave 7 of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), retired individuals aged 50 and over were focused upon. The CASP-19 scale (Control, Autonomy, Self-Realisation, Pleasure), a validated measure of older adults’ quality of life based on control, autonomy, self-realisation, and pleasure, was used as the central outcome variable. Using non-parametric statistical comparisons and unsupervised clustering techniques, differences in CASP scores and associated social, financial, and health variables between early and timely retirees were examined. Analysis reveals that early retirees, despite potentially shorter working lives, tend to report better quality of life, particularly in the autonomy and pleasure subscales of CASP. Additionally, we identify distinct post-retirement profiles through cluster analysis, highlighting the importance of relational closeness and financial preparedness in shaping subjective well-being. This study contributes to ongoing debates in social gerontology by offering a nuanced understanding of how retirement timing intersects with psychosocial outcomes in later life. As policies increasingly favour later retirement, these findings underscore the need to consider not just economic sustainability but also the lived experience and perceived quality of life of older adults.",

Hence, this research aim is to study the effects \nof technology usage on students’ academic performance. Data were collected from 210 \nstudents from the Faculty of Physical Science, University of Ilorin to achieve this aim.\nThe research explores various aspects of technology usage and their effects on academic \nperformance through a detailed analysis, employing statistical methods such as descriptive \nstatistics, correlation analysis, and ordinal logistic regression.\nThe findings from the ordinal logistic regression analysis revealed that several factors \nsignificantly influence academic performance. Notably, the use of laptops for academic \npurposes, collaborative online study, and time spent daily using technology for academic \nactivities were found to positively influence academic outcomes. Conversely, the time \nspent daily on technology for non-academic activities showed a notable negative impact \non academic outcomes.\nThese results underscore the dual-edged nature of technology usage in educational settings, \nhighlighting the importance of promoting productive and collaborative use of technology \namong students to enhance their academic achievements.

Here we reflect on learnings from an eight-year, community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership in British Columbia, Canada that addressed the ongoing public health emergency of toxic drug-related deaths in a semi-urban and rural setting. This challenging research context provides a methodological petri dish from which to examine common ethical challenges inherent in CBPR work. Here we discuss how praxis aligned with the concepts of relationality, embeddedness and embodiment contain both tension and promise in complex research contexts. We depict how relational authenticity was facilitated by flexibility and informal interactions and was further enhanced by deeply-engaged, physical presence that enkindled hope even when hope was hampered by limited agency. We also present commensality as a promising methodological tool.",

          "abstract": "Background\nCanada’s OHIP+ program, implemented in 2018, provided free comprehensive prescription drug coverage to individuals under 25. Given that youths face elevated risks of suicide-related behaviors (SRBs) and frequently encounter cost-related barriers to accessing mental health medications, this study evaluated whether OHIP+ impacted emergency department (ED) visits for SRBs among Ontario youth aged 19–24.\n\nMethods\nWe used linked data from the 2016 Canadian Census and the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System, identifying SRB-related ED visits between April 2016 and March 2020. A single interrupted time series (ITS) and a comparative ITS (CITS) with Coarsened Exact Matching were employed to assess changes in SRB-related ED visits associated with the implementation of OHIP+. The CITS compared low- versus high-socioeconomic status (SES) youths, based on the assumption that low-SES youths are more likely to benefit from public drug coverage due to greater financial barriers.\n\nResults\nOHIP+ implementation was associated with an immediate reduction of 9.4 SRB-related ED visits per 100,000 youth per month (95% CI: -18.2 to -0.6). In the CITS analysis, low-SES youth experienced a significantly greater reduction compared to high-SES youth (difference: -19.6; 95% CI: -37.7 to -1.5). Sex-stratified models indicated that these effects were driven primarily by reductions among females.\n\nConclusion\nPublic drug coverage through OHIP+ was associated with a significant reduction in ED visits for suicide-related behaviors, particularly among low-income and female youth. Our findings underscore the potential of pharmacare to reduce acute mental health crises and promote health equity among vulnerable youth populations.",

          "abstract": "A publication is meaningful in different ways. It is more than objective materiality. A writer sees in a book a great achievement within a tradition of thinking. The corresponding reader finds in the same publication a hermeneutic device. For public discourse, the latest bestselling crossover book provides handy information to special interest readers. To philistine management, a publication is formal authorship in a research assessment exercise. And to varying degrees, all four such personas come together in the ordinary scholar, making the different types of meaning an imbricated whole. In this article, I provide a language for this meaningfulness. I make use of the structural hermeneutics of cultural sociology to demonstrate four key notions of meaning. This language helps to understand the way humanities scholars and other actors in contemporary academia deal with publications. I further illustrate what these abstract notions mean in practice with the recent monograph Also a history of philosophy by Jürgen Habermas.",

          "abstract": "How can resonance in the reception of poetry be understood sociologically? How does the subjective response to poetic works relate to more general social and symbolic structures? I combine Hartmut Rosa’s Resonance Theory with a cultural sociological perspective to illustrate how vertical spheres of resonance—art, nature, religion, or history—can be understood as structures of meaning. I demonstrate how actors transformatively adapt (anverwandeln) a segment of the world to sustain personal meaning and the possibility of resonance. Using Tomas Tranströmer’s poetry as a case study, I demonstrate how poetic reception embodies core elements of resonance—affect, self-efficacy, transformation, and uncontrollability. The cultural sociological reading of Resonance Theory helps to explain the broader cultural dynamics at play. Reception, thus, can be understood as a continuous process in which poetic work becomes a dialogue that reshapes both reader and text. I focus on three phenomena of reception: meaningfulness of form, elemental significance, and uncontrollability of the author’s voice. Ultimately, the case study reveals how poetry, as an iconic medium for existential inquiry, can foster a contemplative relationship to the world—one that resists the instrumentalization of modern society.",

          "abstract": "How can we hear the voice of American civil society in works of art? Civil society relies on solidarity—but when artistic expression becomes overly bound to solidarity’s demands, it may risk losing aesthetic complexity and collapsing into activist moralizing. How does contemporary American literary fiction navigate this tension? This article explores the question by combining a cultural sociological perspective on civil society with a close reading of Colson Whitehead’s work and his trajectory as a writer. I trace two transformations—of both the writer and his literary aesthetic—situating them in the broader social and political context, particularly the rise and fall of the symbolism of Post-blackness. Through an interpretive analysis of The Intuitionist, The Underground Railroad, and The Nickel Boys, I show how Whitehead’s increasing moral engagement paradoxically silences the very voice of civil society he seeks to amplify. This aesthetic shift reflects wider developments in the contemporary relationship between art and activism: as the public court of opinion falters—most visibly during Trump-era politics—art is increasingly compelled to abandon disinterestedness and assume a direct, urgent civil voice.",

Esta investigación examina cómo integran la IA los medios de comunicación del País Vasco, con el objetivo de conocer las prácticas innovadoras que desarrollan en este ámbito y comprender su impacto en las distintas fases del trabajo periodístico. Para ello, se ha adoptado una metodología mixta que combina entrevistas en profundidad a nueve responsables de seis medios vascos con una encuesta a 504 periodistas y profesionales en activo. El análisis se ha estructurado según las tres fases clásicas del proceso periodístico: búsqueda de información, producción de contenido y distribución. Los resultados muestran una adopción cauta de la IA en el plano informativo, pues su uso se orienta principalmente a tareas auxiliares, como la transcripción automática, la corrección de textos o la traducción. Aunque se han identificado iniciativas experimentales innovadoras por parte de los medios, como la clonación de voz en productos narrativos, estas se han desarrollado en contextos periféricos y no informativos. Asimismo, pese al incipiente desarrollo de estrategias corporativas, normativas internas y aplicaciones propias, la implementación de la inteligencia artificial continúa dependiendo en gran medida de las soluciones ofrecidas por las grandes plataformas tecnológicas y de la iniciativa individual de los profesionales.\n\n[EN] Artificial intelligence (AI) is profoundly transforming work in the media sector, reshaping not only production routines but also professional profiles and the internal organisation of newsrooms.

The analysis was structured around the three classic phases of the journalistic process: information gathering, content production, and distribution. The findings reveal a cautious adoption of AI in news related activities, as its use is primarily focused on auxiliary tasks such as automatic transcription, text editing, or translation. While some innovative experimental initiatives have been identified —such as voice cloning in narrative products— these have mostly emerged in peripheral, non-news contexts. Moreover, despite the early development of corporate strategies, internal regulations, and bespoke applications, the implementation of artificial intelligence largely continues to rely on solutions provided by major tech platforms and on the individual initiative of professionals.",

          "abstract": "Theories of legislative politics have long emphasized how a policy's traceability---whether and how voters connect legislative action with policy effects---shapes political incentives to legislate. Arnold (1992) emphasized how the ``nature of the causal chain that links a policy instrument with its policy effects” structures the logic of congressional action. Despite its prominence, this key theoretical claim has received little empirical attention. In this article, we use two survey experiments to test how several policy attributes - including traceability - shape legislators and public policy preferences. We find that elites are responsive to both policy traceability and problem traceability---whether a policy problem itself can be linked to elite actions. By contrast, prospective voters are indifferent to both forms of traceability. With respect to other policy attributes, elites and mass publics share similar preferences. Our results provide support for a previously untested theory of policymaking and describe the nature of strategic decision-making by legislators.",

The method measures changes in choice inconsistency with respect to a plain design. In a highly powered online experiment, we assess three dark patterns and one transparency-based remedy in decisions involving data protection. Compared to a placebo condition, dark patterns increase the likelihood of choice inconsistency by an effect in the range of 6-12 percentage points, depending on experimental conditions. The transparency-based remedy fails to mitigate these effects. A second study implements the transaction test in a market experiment. Here, one of the treatments from the online experiment increases inconsistency by 42 pp. Two additional deceptive designs are tested, respectively favoring consistent and inconsistent choices. The Dark Pattern version raises inconsistency by 18 pp while the Bright Pattern reduces it by 15 pp. Our findings demonstrate how the transaction test, by providing an empirical assessment of the legal concept of unfairness, offers a flexible tool for the regulation of dark patterns and other commercial practices.",

Findings show that Kolintang enriches worship through embodied and communal expressions of faith, nurtures an incarnational and participatory ecclesiology engaging members across generations and denominations, empowers congregations by strengthening identity, and fosters ecumenical dialogue across traditions. Recognition of Kolintang as part of UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage amplifies its significance and situates it within discourses on heritage preservation and cultural sustainability, while offering transferable insights for diasporic and intercultural churches in Asia and Africa. Overall, the study presents a model of contextual ecclesiology that integrates indigenous musical heritage into global theological discourse, demonstrating how churches remain locally rooted while engaging globally.",

          "abstract": "How do consumers react when their favorite product is removed? This paper investigates this question by analyzing individual purchase data from vending machines in Tokyo train stations. We find that the decrease in demand at a consumer’s favorite machine is largely offset by an increase in demand at nonfavorite machines. Surprisingly, demand also increased for products in categories different from that of the removed product. This finding led us to discover that the removal intervention boosted consumer exploration and learning: consumers became more likely to try new products and switch their choices. We posit that prior to the removal, consumers purchased their favorite product at least somewhat out of habit (i.e., an autopilot mode). We also find that high varietyseekers are more likely to choose a substitute at their favorite vending machine, whereas low variety-seekers tend to search for their favorite product at other locations. Although exploration behavior increased uniformly, product switching rose significantly only for low variety-seekers. This suggests that the boosted exploration may mainly benefit high variety-seekers, as it helps them find more products that match their preferences.",

          "abstract": "Despite housing supply shortages in financialised housing markets and acknowledgement of planning application (PA) assessment times as a supply side constraint, reliable and accessible information on PA assessment timeframes is limited. It is in this context that we built a model to predict and explain PA assessment timeframes in New South Wales, Australia. We constructed a dataset of 17,000 PAs (submitted over 3 years) comprising PA attributes, environmental and zoning restrictions, and features derived from PA descriptions using natural language processing techniques. Quantile regression was applied using machine learning modelling to predict probabilistic intervals for assessment timeframes. We then employed an advanced model explanation tool to analyse feature contributions on an overall and individual PA basis. The best performing model, an extreme gradient boosted machine (XGB), achieved an R2 of 0.431, predicting 60.9% of assessment times within one month of actual values. While performance is moderate, the model significantly improves upon previous studies and the current best practice in NSW, which is simply average estimates, by council area, for PA assessment timeframes. The paper concludes by outlining suggestions for further improving model performance and on the benefits of a predictive tool for planners.",

Trump (2017–2021) and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro (2019–2023), democratic backsliding intensified through institutional erosion, illiberal reforms, and growing political pressures on public administration. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 82 Brazilian and 79 U.S. civil servants, this study examines episodes of moral courage - defined as principled actions taken in the face of political pressure and personal risk. We identify the organizational and individual conditions that enable such acts. At the meso level, we find that supportive professional cultures and strong internal and external networks emerge as key facilitators. At the individual level, moral courage is associated with strong commitment to agency missions, a high sense of self-efficacy, long-term moral reflection, and civic engagement. Additionally, cross-national comparison reveals that Brazilian civil servants tended to mobilize through more collective and visible forms of acts of moral courage, whereas their U.S. counterparts often adopted more individualized and cautious strategies. Our findings contribute to public administration scholarship by offering a comparative perspective on bureaucratic resistance during democratic erosion. We also provide a conceptual framework to guide future empirical research and identify concrete enabling conditions and characteristics that support public servants in defending democratic norms under illiberal regimes.",

          "abstract": "It is increasingly recognised that Long Covid may have profound psychosocial implications for children and adolescents, yet systematic reviews have predominantly synthesised findings pertaining to the impact of Long Covid in adults and the COVID-19 pandemic more broadly. This systematic review aimed to synthesise evidence related specifically to the psychosocial impact of Long Covid in children and adolescents. Five academic databases (Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and PsycINFO) were searched for relevant studies using terms related to ‘Long Covid’, ‘children and adolescents’, and ‘psychosocial outcomes’. Grey literature and citation searches were also performed. Quantitative and qualitative studies which estimated the prevalence of, or described, psychosocial outcomes in children and adolescents with Long Covid were included. 41 studies were included, comprising 35 quantitative and six qualitative papers. Five key themes were identified: mental health difficulties, stigma victimisation, and disruption to school functioning, social functioning, and leisure activities. This review lays the groundwork for a new phase of research and practice that regards young people with Long Covid not merely as patients with persistent symptoms but as children, entitled to the same opportunities as their peers, whose developmental, social and emotional needs demand fully equitable attention.",

          "abstract": "Past research suggests that youth who identify with marginalized sexual identities can encounter hostility from their parents due to their sexuality. Such rejection could lead individuals to look to other relationships for material, social, and psychological support as they grow up. We assess this hypothesis by analyzing data produced from a probability survey of U.S. adults that asked respondents to identify the most important people who raised them. Multinomial logistic regression models find that gay or lesbian individuals are more likely than straight individuals to choose their grandmother as the most important person who raised them. Similarly, gay or lesbian individuals are more likely than straight individuals to choose a non-family member—such as a neighbor or teacher—as the second most important person who raised them. These findings provide support for past research that has mainly used qualitative or non-probability data to examine how sexuality shapes family relationships.",

          "abstract": "Despite widespread use in wellbeing research, little is known about whether the Cantril Ladder (CL) and Overall Life Satisfaction (OLS) questions (both 0–10 single-item indicators) capture the same construct in adolescent populations.\nWe analysed data from 6,445 students aged 11–18 in 38 International Baccalaureate schools across 24 countries. We compared CL and OLS using descriptive statistics, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), regression models, and subgroup analyses.\nMean CL and OLS scores were similar, but response distributions differed: OLS showed more extreme values and negative skew. In a CFA including other life evaluation measures, both OLS and CL items loaded on a shared life evaluation latent factor, but OLS showed higher loadings. OLS also showed stronger predictive validity than CL across measures of life evaluation, affect, and eudaimonic wellbeing. Subgroup analyses revealed interpretive differences across age, gender, and language groups (English, Spanish, and French).\nBoth CL and OLS are valid indicators of adolescent life evaluation, but they are not interchangeable. OLS may be preferable as a summary measure due to stronger predictive performance, while CL may offer more consistent subgroup comparability. Researchers should consider these trade-offs when selecting and interpreting single-item wellbeing measures.",

Market values thus arise as dynamic and collectively negotiated constructs,\nreflecting multiple, sometimes conflicting, norms of evaluation.

          "title": "Eco-digital Posthumanism: Definition, Genealogy, and Research Agenda within the EcoAI Framework",
          "authors": "Gianfranco Rubino",
          "abstract": "The concept of Eco-Digital Posthumanism stands as a theoretical horizon within the EcoAI (Rubino, 2025) Framework, envisioning a posthumanist orientation through which humanity, non-human entities, and technological infrastructures co-constitute shared worlds. \nGrounded in a relational ontology, this perspective refuses ontological separations between ‘human’, ‘environment’, and ‘technology’; instead, it frames them as intra-acting, constitutive elements in dynamic assemblages. Drawing on Karen Barad’s notion of intra-action (Barad, 2007), Donna Haraway’s concept of sympoiesis (Haraway, 2016), and Rosi Braidotti’s affirmative ethics of relationality (Braidotti, 2013), Eco-Digital Posthumanism offers a robust ontological and ethical basis for reconsidering human-technology-environment relations as fundamentally entangled.\nThe related EcoAI framework proposes that emergent eco-technologies — including sensing infrastructures, AI-driven environmental monitoring, and digitally mediated communal platforms — are not mere tools, but active mediators that shape both material reality and collective subjectivity. In this light, humans are reconceived as eco-technological intra-agents: their agency is neither purely individual nor detached but arises in dyadic and poly-nodal entanglements with environments and technologies. The ethical imperative intrinsic to this view is to design infrastructures and learning ecologies that foster mutual care, multispecies attentiveness, and distributed co-agency.\nA vital tension animates the formation of the Eco-Digital Humanism theory: on one side, the ecological system demands renewed forms of relationality between humans, environments, places, and presences. This demand emphasizes physical co-presence, material engagement, and practices that re-embed subjectivities in place-based knowledge, embodied awareness, and ecological responsiveness. Here, educational media play a key role: Antonio López defines ecomedia literacy as the critical capacity to comprehend and engage with the reciprocal ecological “footprint” and cultural “mindprint” of media systems (López 2020, DOI:10.4324/9780203731109). This socio-pedagogical pillar grounds the theory in media-ecological practice. It calls for pedagogies and practices that re-embed subjectivities in place-based knowledges, somatic awareness, and ecological attunement.\nOn the other hand, stands the rise of an immaterial relational geographies: social media, algorithmic platforms, influential digital narratives, ephemeral trend dynamics, and hyper-mediated connectivity craft relational spaces that lean toward an individualistic massification which often replace embodied interaction with curated digital self-expression and mediated connectivity with risks of disembedding relationality. These forces often substitute co-present engagement — with its embodied gestures, proxemics, and spontaneous nonverbal communication — with curated digital self-expression and algorithm-driven interaction. The communication shifts from embodied co-construction to performative self-branding, from tangible immediacy to mediated simulacra. José van Dijck and colleagues analyse how these platforms shape public life and values through infrastructural power (van Dijck, Poell &amp; de Waal 2018, DOI:10.23860/MGDR-2018-03-03-08). Moreover, scholars like Couldry and Mejias warn of data colonialism, where personal data are appropriated in ways akin to digital exploitation (Couldry &amp; Mejias 2019, DOI:10.1177/1527476418796632). These critical sociological perspectives highlight how algorithmic systems can erode embodied co-presence and place-based relationality. This tension must be at the heart of Eco-Digital Humanism: it calls for technologies, pedagogies, and AI systems that restore and augment embodied, place-rooted relational ethics, rather than further eroding them.\nEco-Digital Posthumanism therefore envisions a middle path: techno-ecological designs and curricular frameworks that honour the ecological imperative for reciprocity, material co-presence, and affective attunement, while resisting the flattening of relationality that results from algorithmic mass individualism. In this, Eco-Digital Posthumanism embeds both philosophical depth and sociological grounding (López, van Dijck, Couldry &amp; Mejias), extending ecological posthumanism (as developed by Oppermann, 2016;) and material ecocriticism (Iovino &amp; Oppermann, 2014), by providing a mediation-centred, operational lens for guiding education, ethical design, and the governance of AI-mediated environments.\nIn sum, Eco-Digital Humanism posits that humans, non-humans, and technological systems co-create worlds; that ecological instances of sustainability necessitate relational, place-embedded forms of being and that the rising immaterial relational geographies without proper literacy threaten to separate us from those embodied ecologies. The theory thus demands a reconfiguration — through EcoAI Framework — of pedagogy, policy, and design, so that the digital infrastructures serve ecological relationality rather than displace it.",

The effect is primarily driven by White Britons. Path modelling indicates that the ruling indirectly increased prejudice against immigrants ant anti-immigrant party voting intentions. The results suggest that declaring the Rwanda plan unconstitutional threatened the British public and made them more in favour of hierarchies between groups -- leading to electoral gains for anti-immigrant parties.

          "authors": "Charis Papaevangelou; Max van Drunen",
          "abstract": "The growing reliance of journalism on platforms has profoundly affected the political economy of journalism. In response to growing concerns over platforms’ discretionary power over journalism, the EU introduced a legally-binding media privilege’ with its European Media Freedom Act (EMFA), seeking to protect journalistic content from platforms’ unjust content moderation mechanisms. While the EMFA represents a significant affirmation of journalism’s normative value and the need for elevated legal protections, this article identifies a fundamental paradox at the core of the regulation: by entrusting critical procedural obligations to platform companies, the EMFA risks entrenching rather than mitigating platforms’ discretionary power over journalism. Using a doctrinal legal analysis of the EMFA, supplemented by a critical evaluation of its platform-press implications and the broader sociopolitical context, we foreground how the EMFA’s procedural reliance on platforms stop it short from realising its normative ambitions regarding journalism’s democratic value. Drawing on interdisciplinary scholarship, we identify two structural reasons for this paradox: the EU’s consistent underestimation of platform firms’ material interests and its misguided faith in procedural fairness and multistakeholder governance models. Ultimately, we contend that structural and not procedural changes are required to effectively protect journalism’s democratic value.",

Its extensive prevalence in low-income countries calls for a reliable method to measure the effectiveness of government expenditure in the area, especially because many countries underperform or overperform on maternal and child health relative to health spending. This review establishes the Basic Health Infrastructure Index (BHII), constructed from normalized indicators of hospital beds, physician and midwifery personnel distribution, as a better matrix towards the predictability of maternal and child health statistics compared to the mere traditional health expenditure as % of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) proxy in determining associations. Results and case studies from 7 countries support the thesis that basic health infrastructure is a vital determinant of constraints, targeting optimizes outcomes, and GDP serves as a context rather than an indicator of reduced maternal mortality and under-5 mortality. This study recommends a three-step investment strategy for low-income countries: ensuring countries meet their determined minimum infrastructure threshold, then layering targeting programs for high-risk populations, followed by monitoring return-on-investment metrics. These are justified by philosophical approaches for the least advantaged.",

Drawing on 41 Australian and international peer-reviewed and grey literature sources, the review identifies pathways of housing loss through economic coercion, safety threats, and actions from abusers that can prevent women from acquiring stable housing. Homeless DV survivors experience heightened trauma, poor mental health, and barriers to help-seeking. The evidence highlights the effectiveness of empowerment-based casework, safe-at-home programs, rental subsidies, and flexible funding in fostering resiliency. Based on these findings, policy recommendations focus on DV education before separation, as well as housing projects that are integrated with survivor-centred support services to prevent homelessness and promote recovery.\nKeywords: domestic violence, women, intimate partner violence, homelessness, economic coercion, housing services, Australia",

Three dynamics emerge: (1) moralized visibility, where leaders’ presence signals sincerity and authenticity; (2) conditional submission, where compliance is negotiated, reversible, and grounded in fairness; and (3) hybrid accountability, where digital reforms gain legitimacy only when accompanied by relational responsiveness. By foregrounding these everyday practices, the study develops a meso-level framework that complements but also departs from clientelism, coercion, and populism, while engaging perspectives on moral economy and democratic ambivalence. It highlights the cultural foundations of reformist politics and shows that modernization acquires meaning only when refracted through expectations of presence, fairness, and care.",

          "abstract": "How do consumers react when their favorite product is removed? This paper sheds light on this question by analyzing purchase behavior at vending machines in Tokyo train stations, where the majority of machines underwent product changes during our sample period. Using a synthetic difference-in-differences approach, we find evidence of consumers substituting both within and across vending machines. Notably, consumer demand expands at their non-favorite machines, driven not only by purchases of their favorite product but also of other products. Most interestingly, we document increased consumer experimentation: after removal of their favorite product, consumers become more frequently try new products and switch choices, consistent with learning behavior.  This implies that persistent choice of a “favorite” product may partly reflect habit, and its removal can disrupt one’s routines, and prompting exploration. We also show heterogeneous treatment effect by variety-seeking tendency: High variety-seekers are more likely to choose a substitute at their favorite vending machine, whereas low variety-seekers tend to search for their favorite product elsewhere. However, experimentation and learning behaviors are invariant to variety-seeking tendency.",

As devaluation rests on shared cultural beliefs, both demand and supply sides are analyzed. On the demand side, Study 1 applies word embedding–based text analysis to real-world Japanese job ads. On the supply side, Study 2 uses a factorial survey where participants evaluated fictitious job postings. The results suggest that both demand and supply sides share the belief that feminine meanings embedded in job ads—such as stereotypically feminine traits/skills and family-oriented WLB—do not deserve higher compensation.

We illustrate these approaches with detailed workflow examples from a large-scale ethnographic study and guidance for solo researchers.

To make this case, the\nessay begins with a methodological critique of orthodox economics through the lens of\nthe philosophy of science, in particular with respect to the definition of capital. George’s\nideas are situated in their historical context, reconstructing his ethical and scientific\nreasoning and his extraordinary, if often overlooked, influence in the Anglo-Saxon world\nand beyond.

          "abstract": "This study examined longitudinal associations between caregiver-child dyadic unpredictability, children’s verbal abilities, and externalizing problems, and the moderating role of temperamental surgency. Participants were 235 families with young children (Mage =2.97 years, SD = 0.38, range: [2,4], 55.3% female, ethnicity: 55.2% White, 21.3% African American, 16.2% mixed race). Mother-child dyadic unpredictability measured at wave one was linked to lower verbal development over waves one and two, which was associated with greater increases in externalizing problems over waves one and three. These effects were particularly salient for children with high surgency. In contrast, father-child dyadic unpredictability was linked to greater verbal ability for children with low temperamental surgency, although this finding did not hold after controlling for the variability in child dysregulation during father-child interaction. Furthermore, findings revealed a curvilinear association between father-child dyadic unpredictability in association with the development of children’s verbal ability. The present study has important implications for understanding unpredictability within parent-child interactions and its influence on child development. (©American Psychological Association, 2025.

          "abstract": "Abstract Zhihu.com, as a representative of the Social Question and Answer (SQA) community in China, currently has a very large user base. Experts, scholars and talent from all walks of life are brought together on this network. Compared with other social media websites, the education levels and quality of online users on Zhihu.com are generally high. Young people represent the largest demographic group of users. This dissertation took young people as the research object and analyses their knowledge contribution behaviour in the online SQA community. The study adopted an online observation approach and semi-structured interview methodology. The researcher observed the online knowledge contribution behaviour for an extended period, and conducted in-depth interviews with 25 long-term users. Users were grouped according to gender and age, and the differences in knowledge contribution among these different groups were analysed and compared. The study asked the questions: what characters and personalities do these participants have? Why do participants contribute to the SQA community, and how does contributing to an online SQA forum differ from offline knowledge contributions? Through investigation, the study found that knowledge contributors are enthusiastic and have a strong sense of social responsibility. They are willing to learn and self-motivated. However, even though they may not have a clear purpose in the contribution of knowledge, 6 they help to build their own reputations, broaden social networks and make money eventually. This dissertation attempted to apply Bourdieu’s theory of capital as a framework to explain how users go about accumulating symbolic, economic, cultural and social capital by contributing knowledge. To conclude the study, the researcher drew conclusions concerning the difference between online and offline knowledge contribution on SQA communities.\n\nKeywords: Knowledge Contribution, SQA communities, Social Capital, Prosocial Behaviour",

          "abstract": "This paper uses elements of fractal geometry to describe the distribution of income among individuals. It shows the existence of a stochastic fractal relationship between a country’s output and income inequality: the higher the level of income inequality, the lower the country’s output. The framework thus allows us to isolate the impact of inequality on output from that of average growth. A parallel between this framework and a welfarist approach to distributional analysis is also discussed. (Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality Working Paper)",

          "abstract": "Scholarship on journalism in the digital age has often pointed to a gap between audiences’ expectations of journalism and what journalists actually do in their work as one reason for the global decline in news trust and consumption. Much of this work has, however, evolved from studies of journalistic role perceptions to measure audiences’ expectations of these same roles. In line with the so-called audience turn in (digital) journalism studies, this study takes an audience-centric approach to better understand what it is that audiences want, in the hope of better informing journalistic work. Through an analysis of 35 observations and in-depth interviews with audience members in Austria, we examine audiences’ demands, beliefs, and assessments of journalists, and the relations among these expectation modes. Our findings demonstrate the complex nature of audiences’ expectations and reveal seven dimensions. Four of these aligned partially with normative journalistic roles: expectations of (1) information; (2) interpretation; (3) accountability; and (4) activism. The remaining three extend beyond them, including expectations of (5) emotional connection; (6) interaction; and (7) societal relevance. These insights highlight what audiences value in journalism, offering a foundation for news content that caters to their needs.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces Commoning Accessibility (CA) as a new framework for understanding and enabling equitable access to urban services within the context of the 15-minute city (15mC). While the 15mC promotes proximity-based access to everyday amenities, it often overlooks the social and relational processes through which accessibility is produced and maintained. Drawing on emerging debates about commoning mobility and mobilities of care, we argue that accessibility should not be understood merely as a function of spatial proximity or individual mobility, but as a collectively shaped resource that emerges through shared practices, infrastructures, and governance. Inviting for a reflection on a wide range of underexplored community-led initiatives—from shared mobility schemes and care services to locally run facilities—that actively reshape access in ways aligned with the principles of commoning and framing those under the umbrella of CA, the paper propose a new research agenda. The research agenda is structured around five key areas: firstly, mapping enabling conditions for CA practices; secondly, understanding CA practices; thirdly, supporting the development of CA as experiments; fourthly, assessing CA impacts; and fifthly, identifying supportive policy frameworks. With such an agenda, the paper calls for a shift in accessibility planning—from top-down, metric-driven approaches to ones that centre collective agency, everyday interdependencies, and community-led innovation. This reorientation has significant implications for how accessibility is governed, experienced, and sustained in the pursuit of just mobilities.",

We study the Tour de France (TdF) as a case of brief but highly visible exposure that combines economic activity with symbolic recognition. Using variation in the annual TdF route between 2002 and 2022, we show that exposed municipalities experience declines in far-right support of 0.03–0.04 standard deviations. The effect exceeds 0.1 standard deviations in recent elections and is strongest in poorer areas and in towns with high prior far-right support. We find evidence consistent with the symbolic mechanism and mixed evidence for the economic one. TdF exposure increases local GDP per capita, effects on voting are larger when French riders win stages, and a two-wave survey around the 2025 TdF provides suggestive evidence that residents in exposed towns report greater pride and recognition. These results contribute to research on geographic inequalities, symbolic politics, and the electoral consequences of place-based interventions.",

          "abstract": "Shifting toward plant-based diets is a crucial aspect of mitigating climate change. As part of this transition, growing the plant-based meat and plant-based dairy industries has significant potential to reduce the environmental impacts of food systems in Western countries. To date, little research has examined the systemic challenges faced by stakeholders involved in developing and supporting these industries. By applying a multi-stakeholder perspective, our study addresses this gap in the literature, exploring the drivers and barriers influencing industry growth. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 respondents representing consumers, manufacturers and retailers. Reflexive thematic analysis was applied, identifying seven overlapping themes applicable to both industries. Findings indicate that support for plant-based products is often grounded in sustainability goals and belief that newer plant-based alternatives can effectively meet consumer expectations. However, industry growth is restricted by structural challenges, including the influence of the meat and dairy sector, negative consumer perceptions, and the high financial risk of investing in emerging alternatives. Stakeholders identified two key changes needed: greater industry investment and more effective strategies to stimulate consumer demand. Applying the multi-level perspective (MLP) to interpret findings suggests that the plant-based meat and plant-based dairy sectors are still operating as niche industries, and that sector growth depends on changes at both the niche and regime levels to fully integrate plant-based meat and plant-based dairy into the food system. This research contributes original insights into the dynamics of sustainable food system transformation by foregrounding stakeholder experiences across multiple points in the value chain.",

Interviewer, Ditte Andersen (DA), probes Berman’s argument on how the economic style of reasoning is linked to specific values, especially the value of efficiency, in ways that crowd out other values (e.g. democratic participation, universal rights) and constrain social policy thinking in contemporary Western societies. Social investment policies epitomize the economic style of reasoning by orientating towards returns of public spending. In policy domains such as education, ‘social investment in action’ forefronts the value of returns (in the future) rather than, for example, the value of equality and universalism (in the present). The interview also turns attention to the role of sociologists in denaturalizing the taken for granted and aid the imagination of alternative futures.",

          "abstract": "I analyze how occupations are portrayed in contemporary popular fiction by coding the protagonists' and love interests' professions in 1181 bestselling novels from 2023--2024. Using large language model–assisted extraction with human oversight, I map which roles dominate across genres and compare them to real-world occupational data. The results show that fiction highlights a narrow set of archetypes---e.g., students, writers, detectives, athletes---while downplaying most everyday forms of labor. Overrepresentation is shaped partly by prestige: higher-status jobs are somewhat more likely to be emphasized, but many exceptions remain, with some prestigious professions underrepresented (e.g., tech executives and engineers) while low-prestige but narratively useful roles (e.g., hunters, antique dealers) are prominent. In romance titles, occupational portrayals diverge sharply by gender: men are written into positions of power, danger, or transgression, while women are more often portrayed in expressive or domestic roles. Comparing these fictional portrayals to survey and dating-app data on occupational desirability reveals consistent gaps, underscoring how cultural products use work as symbolic resources for storytelling and signaling desirability rather than mirroring labor markets.",

          "abstract": "This study introduces the Public-sector Chatbot Performance (PCP) framework, a novel and comprehensive approach to systematically assess AI chatbot performance in public administration. The framework evaluates both technical competence—factual accuracy, completeness, and source reliability—and normative integrity, including lawfulness, transparency, equality, and privacy. To demonstrate applicability of the PCP framework, we benchmark the full set of municipal chatbot systems currently deployed in Dutch local governments, alongside two leading proprietary large language models (LLMs): ChatGPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Using a pragmatic mixed methods approach, we developed 26 prompts with systematic user-based variation to explore algorithmic bias, resulting in a dataset of n=326 user-chatbot interactions. Quantitative analysis revealed that ChatGPT-4o achieved a composite performance score of 95.7%, significantly outperforming all municipal systems. Municipal chatbots exhibited notable shortcomings in competence and integrity, with some failing to meet basic standards of lawful and equal service provision. Exploratory qualitative analysis further uncovered algorithmic opacity, discretionary advice in violation of Dutch good governance regulations, and discriminatory responses based on “ethnic” usernames. These insights challenge assumptions about neutrality in public sector AI and underscore the need for ethical benchmarks in chatbot evaluation. The PCP framework offers actionable guidance for policymakers, technologists, and scholars committed to responsible digital governance.",

          "abstract": "Climate services and co-production efforts aim to support adaptation by making climate information useful and usable. Yet many services and research projects prioritize improving data quality over understanding decision-making needs. This limits insights into what we define as true demand: the actionable need for information that would improve decisions, if conditions allowed. Here, we present a systematic sectoral analysis grounded in behavioral theory exploring whether, where, and how better climate predictions could improve decisions. We apply this approach to two climate-sensitive sectors in Germany: agriculture and forestry. Using expert focus groups (N = 24), we identify key adaptation decisions and analyze current decision strategies. Drawing on the COM-B model for behavior (B) change, we examine the capabilities (C), opportunities (O), and motivation (M) necessary to use climate predictions in practice. Our findings reveal that foresighted adaptation is often constrained by gaps in knowledge, lack of opportunity, or limited motivation. These constraints diminish the perceived importance of climate predictions on the subseasonal to decadal timescale or prevent their use, with decision-makers instead relying on past experience and heuristics such as worst-case planning. Nevertheless, experts expressed interest in improved predictions---particularly for variability and extremes across intra-annual to multi-year timescales---that could inform decisions. True demand may remain masked, blocked, or unexpressed if decision-makers lack the capabilities, opportunities, or motivation to recognize, act on, or articulate it. Our approach provides a systematic way to assess where and how predictions could improve decisions, shifting the focus from better data to better decisions.",

Using a small sample of 15 posts on mental health issues from the social media platform Reddit, we explore how large language models interpret, organize, and communicate information based on researchers’ prompts. Prompting itself is a process in which researchers provide both a definition of the situation and of relevant identities for a GPT to assume, which directly shape its interpretive capacity and output. We compare ChatGPT-4o, the latest personal subscription version available at the time of writing, and Microsoft AutoGen, a more powerful API version capable of organizing multiple GPT agents to complete research tasks semi-autonomously. We describe and evaluate the structure and content of each model’s output, including how they engage with data thematically, empirically, and conceptually. We also highlight differences in depth and coherence of their analyses. We show how changes to prompts influenced the GPTs’ interpretative actions, yielding both expected and novel analytical insights. Our preliminary findings suggest that GPTs hold promise for advancing qualitative analysis of big data, albeit with some limitations in analytic depth and occasional hallucination errors. The study contributes to nascent symbolic interactionist scholarship on nonhuman agents in qualitative research, positioning GPTs as semi-autonomous research collaborators.",

Classical-regional music dichotomy is an omnipresent classification of the music in Iran, representing the notions of nationality and ethnicity, respectively. This paper aims to study how the dynamics between nationality and ethnicity in Iran have been reflected in the relationships between classical and regional music. I draw on Maria Sonevytsky’s (2022) and Tanya Merchant’s (2014) study of evolutionism in the former Soviet Union and Rasmus Elling’s study (2015) of the minorities in Iran. Focusing on the mostly Iranian musicologists’ and musicians’ published articles, essays, and interviews as well as my experience in the field as a student of Iranian classical music at the University of Tehran, I argue that the prevalent discourse has conflated the sociopolitical notion of Unity in Diversity with the previously established hierarchical mindset in music such that it resulted in the delineation of a hierarchical order of musical systems. I hope to show how the devastating implications of evolutionism can breach contemporary conceptualizations.",

          "authors": "Lutz Peschke",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Sextuple Helix Innovation Model as a novel framework for understanding the role of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in culture- and creativity-driven as well as sustainable innovation ecosystems. Building on the evolution from the Triple Helix (university–industry–government) to the Quintuple Helix (including the media-based/culture-based public and the natural environment), the proposed model adds GenAI as a sixth helix. Unlike previous views of AI as a mere tool, this paper conceptualizes GenAI as an independent knowledge producer with its own knowledge economy, engaged in mutual exchanges with human and institutional actors. The argument is grounded in a constructionist epistemology and knowledge economy theory, validated through a scoping review of scholarly literature across creative industries, cultural policy, and innovation studies. The review reveals that while GenAI augments human creativity by enabling co-creation, ideation, and democratization of cultural production, it simultaneously raises challenges such as curatorialization of labor, reduced diversity of outputs, and threats to artistic autonomy. The framework of mutual creativity emphasizes reciprocal influences: human creativity shapes AI outputs just as AI reshapes human creative processes. By positioning GenAI as an epistemic agent, the Sextuple Helix Innovation Model reframes discourses beyond the dominant narratives of disruption and regulation. It highlights opportunities for transforming labor markets, enabling sustainable cultural practices, and expanding innovation ecologies through “phygital” recombination of digital and traditional forms. At the same time, it underscores the need for critical awareness of biases, cultural sensitivity, and ethical implications inherent in AI-driven knowledge production. Ultimately, the paper argues that recognizing GenAI as a helix in its own right not only deepens our understanding of knowledge economies but also paves the way for creativity- and sustainability-oriented innovation paradigms where human and non-human actors co-produce knowledge.",

Analyzing data from a 2024 Pew Research Center poll, this visualization describes the views of U.S. survey respondents on the issue of declining birth rates, with about half (49%) of respondents expressing a negative view of the trend. Those most likely to offer this view are politically conservative, attend religious services more often, and they are more likely older, male, married, and more highly educated. Second, they are more likely to view climate change, racism, and gun violence as not serious problems, and to view illegal immigration and the state of moral values in the country as serious problems. Thus, the negative perception of falling birth rates is generally associated with right-leaning concerns and identities in the U.S. (with the exception of education).",

          "abstract": "The concept of Eco-Digital Posthumanism stands as a theoretical horizon within the EcoAI (Rubino, 2025) Framework, envisioning a posthumanist orientation through which humanity, non-human entities, and technological infrastructures co-constitute shared worlds. \nGrounded in a relational ontology, this perspective refuses ontological separations between ‘human’, ‘environment’, and ‘technology’; instead, it frames them as intra-acting, constitutive elements in dynamic assemblages. Drawing on Karen Barad’s notion of intra-action (Barad, 2007), Donna Haraway’s concept of sympoiesis (Haraway, 2016), and Rosi Braidotti’s affirmative ethics of relationality (Braidotti, 2013), Eco-Digital Posthumanism offers a robust ontological and ethical basis for reconsidering human-technology-environment relations as fundamentally entangled.\nThe related EcoAI framework proposes that emergent eco-technologies — including sensing infrastructures, AI-driven environmental monitoring, and digitally mediated communal platforms — are not mere tools, but active mediators that shape both material reality and collective subjectivity. In this light, humans are reconceived as eco-technological intra-agents: their agency is neither purely individual nor detached but arises in dyadic and poly-nodal entanglements with environments and technologies. The ethical imperative intrinsic to this view is to design infrastructures and learning ecologies that foster mutual care, multispecies attentiveness, and distributed co-agency.\nA vital tension animates the formation of the Eco-Digital Humanism theory: on one side, the ecological system demands renewed forms of relationality between humans, environments, places, and presences. This demand emphasizes physical co-presence, material engagement, and practices that re-embed subjectivities in place-based knowledge, embodied awareness, and ecological responsiveness. Here, educational media play a key role: Antonio López defines ecomedia literacy as the critical capacity to comprehend and engage with the reciprocal ecological “footprint” and cultural “mindprint” of media systems (López 2020, DOI:10.4324/9780203731109). This socio-pedagogical pillar grounds the theory in media-ecological practice. It calls for pedagogies and practices that re-embed subjectivities in place-based knowledges, somatic awareness, and ecological attunement.\nOn the other hand, stands the rise of an immaterial relational geographies: social media, algorithmic platforms, influential digital narratives, ephemeral trend dynamics, and hyper-mediated connectivity craft relational spaces that lean toward an individualistic massification which often replace embodied interaction with curated digital self-expression and mediated connectivity with risks of disembedding relationality. These forces often substitute co-present engagement — with its embodied gestures, proxemics, and spontaneous nonverbal communication — with curated digital self-expression and algorithm-driven interaction. The communication shifts from embodied co-construction to performative self-branding, from tangible immediacy to mediated simulacra. José van Dijck and colleagues analyse how these platforms shape public life and values through infrastructural power (van Dijck, Poell &amp; de Waal 2018, DOI:10.23860/MGDR-2018-03-03-08). Moreover, scholars like Couldry and Mejias warn of data colonialism, where personal data are appropriated in ways akin to digital exploitation (Couldry &amp; Mejias 2019, DOI:10.1177/1527476418796632). These critical sociological perspectives highlight how algorithmic systems can erode embodied co-presence and place-based relationality. This tension must be at the heart of Eco-Digital Humanism: it calls for technologies, pedagogies, and AI systems that restore and augment embodied, place-rooted relational ethics, rather than further eroding them.\nEco-Digital Posthumanism therefore envisions a middle path: techno-ecological designs and curricular frameworks that honour the ecological imperative for reciprocity, material co-presence, and affective attunement, while resisting the flattening of relationality that results from algorithmic mass individualism. In this, Eco-Digital Posthumanism embeds both philosophical depth and sociological grounding (López, van Dijck, Couldry &amp; Mejias), extending ecological posthumanism (as developed by Oppermann, 2016;) and material ecocriticism (Iovino &amp; Oppermann, 2014), by providing a mediation-centred, operational lens for guiding education, ethical design, and the governance of AI-mediated environments.\nIn sum, Eco-Digital Humanism posits that humans, non-humans, and technological systems co-create worlds; that ecological instances of sustainability necessitate relational, place-embedded forms of being and that the rising immaterial relational geographies without proper literacy threaten to separate us from those embodied ecologies. The theory thus demands a reconfiguration — through EcoAI Framework — of pedagogy, policy, and design, so that the digital infrastructures serve ecological relationality rather than displace it.",

          "authors": "Nguyen Thanh Trung; Truong Thi Hoai Linh; Nguyen Tri Khoa",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the bidirectional dynamics between credit growth and banking stability in the context of Vietnam, where the financial system is dominated by banks and the macroprudential framework is strongly strengthened over the period 2008–2024. Using a quarterly panel dataset of 29 Vietnamese commercial banks (Q1/2008–Q4/2024) and a Panel VAR (PVAR) model to handle endogeneity, the study quantifies the time-varying responses of credit growth (CRE) and the stability indicator Z-score to structural shocks. The main results show that: (i) a positive shock to banking stability increases credit in a statistically significant and persistent manner across multiple quarters; (ii) a credit growth shock does not have a significant impact on Z-score in the short–medium horizon; and (iii) the forecast variance decomposition (FEVD) shows asymmetry: Z-score variation is largely “autogenerated”, while CRE variation is increasingly explained by stability shocks (approximately 9–10% in the 10th quarter). Granger causality tests confirm a unidirectional relationship from stability to credit. The findings imply a “stability-first, credit-quality-later” policy priority order: strengthening capital and earnings quality, cross-cyclical provisioning discipline, and maintaining macroprudential tools that help expand credit supply sustainably without sacrificing systemic safety. The study contributes quantitative evidence in emerging markets, complementing the international literature that often emphasizes the credit-to-crisis channel, and suggests extensions to nonlinearities/thresholds and bank-specific heterogeneity.",

          "authors": "Abul Kalam Azad; Mahbub-ul Alam; Shamme Akter",
          "abstract": "Gender disparity remains a critical concern in sociological research and global policy discourse. In alignment with social mobility theories, the elimination of gender inequality has gained international attention, exemplified by the World Economic Forum’s Global Social Mobility Index (GSMI). Although gender equality is a core objective of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), its formulation from a social mobility perspective remains underexplored in the context of Bangladesh. This study aims to examine the impact of intergenerational social mobility on gender equality in Bangladesh. Using an explanatory research design, the study develops a social mobility model of the Gender Inequality Index (GII) and employs a household survey conducted through a multi-stage sampling technique. Findings indicate that the downward socioeconomic status (SES1) of parents reinforces gender inequality, whereas the upward mobility (SES2) of their children contributes to its reduction. The study concludes that fostering upward social mobility could be instrumental in addressing gender inequality across future generations in Bangladesh. These findings hold consistent across varied datasets, sample frames, and model specifications.",

          "abstract": "This research aims to examine the current state of integrating artificial intelligence into education and training processes from the perspectives of teachers, academics and students. The systematic review method, a qualitative research approach, was employed in conducting the research. An evaluation was conducted based on research theses in Turkey, focusing on education and training, and including artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) applications for teachers, academics, and students. As a result of the search in the Council of Higher Education (YÖK) thesis center, 71 theses were identified by searching the keyword \"artificial intelligence\" in the title and abstract sections of the theses related to \"Education and Training\". The data obtained from the theses were analyzed by the content analysis method. An evaluation was conducted on the use of artificial intelligence technologies in education by examining their distribution according to years, sample groups, study areas, topics, variables addressed, and the results of these variables. According to the findings, there has been a significant increase in the studies on the use of AIEd in the last year. Artificial intelligence is primarily used in language teaching, followed by studies in computer programming and science. Artificial intelligence supported teaching environments, creating course materials with AI, and using tools such as chatbots in teaching processes are among the popular topics. Studies on AIEd have examined numerous variables, examining students' cognitive, skill-based, and affective learning outcomes. While the use of AI has been found to positively impact academic achievement, metacognitive behaviors, and sustained learning, skill-based learning has also yielded positive results in variables such as writing and reading skills in foreign language teaching, problem-solving skills, and creativity, as well as affective learning outcomes such as attitude, satisfaction, and motivation. While teachers and academics' awareness of AI is high, their readiness and anxiety levels are moderate. While teachers stated that they need practical in-service training on the educational use of AI, they have been identified as having some pedagogical, ethical, and technical concerns regarding the use of AIEd. These results are thought to guide new research on the use of AIEd.",

          "abstract": "Background: In today’s world, one of the requirements is the urgent need to provide fast, low-cost, affordable, and high-quality medical services. These demands have led to the invention of ways in which medical services can be provided to patients in their homes. Methods: This study aimed to analyze patients’ experience of the implementation of telemedicine in Saudi Arabia (Riyadh City). Samples from different categories of patients were randomly selected following opportunity sampling techniques. The study population included 332 participants (male and female). For data collection, we used a questionnaire consisting of 8 items. The questions were rated using a 5-point Likert scale (agree, strongly agree, average, disagree, and strongly disagree). Results: A total of 67 (19.5%) participants reported that they use telemedicine only for medical consultation, while 47 (13.7%) said that they use it for diagnosis and treatment as well. The participants revealed that telemedicine saves them time and money. However, they admitted that telemedicine negatively affected their relationship with the service providers. Finally, patients described communication challenges and a lack of confidence in accessing telemedicine. Conclusions: The study concluded that the main barriers to the use of telemedicine services are a lack of confidence in accessing telemedicine, difficulty communicating due to the use of different languages and dialects, and the fact that these services are not suitable for uneducated people.",

Mining activities if not carried out properly can have negative impacts on the environment in the form of decreased land productivity, increased soil compaction, erosion and sedimentation, soil movement or landslides, disruption of flora and fauna, and disruption of coal mining health. Law Number 44 of 2009 concerning Minerals and Coal is still felt to not be on the side of the common people. The negative impact is felt in the environment and society. For this reason, Law Number 4 of 2009 must be understood substantively and progressively for community prosperity without damaging the environment. The function of the law in the field of environmental conservation is a social engineer. In this field, it is hoped that behavior will be created that is oriented towards environmental sustainability, natural biological resources, and their ecosystem for the benefit of the present and future generations.

          "authors": "Katerina Havrankova",
          "abstract": "This study presents a structured attempt at deciphering the Voynich Manuscript, focusing on folio 78r (from the so-called balneological section depicting bathing women), folio 70v (the Zodiac Capricorn or “Goat” folio from the astrological section), and three herbal folios. The central hypothesis is that the text represents an existing language—most plausibly an archaic form of Basque—recorded phonetically and written with unfamiliar symbols in place of ordinary letters.\n\nThe analysis combines identification of vowels and recurring letter patterns with systematic comparison to Basque vocabulary and morphology, yielding partial but consistent matches. Evidence also points to contact with Old French, Castilian, Gascon, and Latin, reflecting the multilingual environment of late medieval Navarre.\n\nThe herbal folios align with descriptive plant entries typical of medieval herbals, mentioning stems, joints, sap, bitterness, and preparations such as decoctions. Folio 78r, usually interpreted as part of the balneological section, is here read as a description of water channels, basins, and flowing currents, consistent with the illustrations of bathing women. Folio 70v, traditionally identified with Capricorn in the zodiac cycle, is interpreted as a text describing cyclical or seasonal processes, in line with its astrological imagery.\n\nAlthough the translations remain provisional, the findings suggest that the manuscript is unlikely to represent an invented language. Instead, it may be a distorted record of existing speech and knowledge, intentionally obscured through phonetic variation and a disguised script.\n\nThis version integrates methodological refinements and interpretive notes into the main text, while earlier draft material has been removed. The results provide linguistic leads, structural insights, and a testable framework that may serve as a foundation for further philological and contextual research.",

          "abstract": "In this paper I argue that there are many paths forward for a problem that often seems to have no solution at all: the methodological, theoretical, and analytical distinctions that drive the many distinct modes of doing anthropology. The approach I describe aims to help trace dense resonances between branches of anthropological theory that often seem categorically distinct and to add precision, depth, and ultimately generativity to the points at which they are in fact distinct. I do this by introducing a new metatheoretical framework and generative grammar for understanding the relationships between theories of ritual and social process. The starting point for this is the differences themselves between competing or distinct kinds of theory. By developing two multimodal axes, expressing high-dimensional rather than binary forms of differences, a much higher-dimensional, generative space opens up for finding productive resonances and tensions across wide domains of inquiry, ultimately helping to build generative forms of reflexivity for each.",

          "abstract": "Startups that import MVP-first logics into high-context African markets frequently stall not because products lack utility, but because ventures lack permission to operate. This paper proposes Minimum Viable Relationships (MVR) as a relational-readiness gate that precedes MVP in such contexts. MVR formalizes the conditions under which counterparties (customers, distributors, institutions) grant access without triggering social or organizational sanction. The paper defines the construct, situates it against adjacent ideas (design thinking, diffusion of innovations), and argues that where social sanction outweighs functional risk, relationship viability must be validated before product experiments can be considered valid.\n\nThe paper contributes three artifacts: (1) a seven-dimensional MVR diagnostic with go/no-go thresholds that scores embeddedness, trust, guardian vouches, and channel permission; (2) an MVR Investment Memo template that enables funders to assess relational risk alongside financial and operational risk; and (3) a practical design-lab of field tools for earning permission (pilot-site commitments, data-sharing agreements, compliance pathways, and referral loops). Comparative case vignettes (e.g., SafeBoda, KOKO Networks, Wave versus Dash, Sendy) illustrate how early permission artifacts are associated with durable traction.\n\nThe framework reframes early venture due diligence in Africa from “Can the product work?” to “Are we allowed to make it work here?” and offers testable propositions for founders, investors, and ecosystem builders. Limitations and avenues for empirical study are discussed.",

          "abstract": "As statutory retirement ages rise, predicting early retirement becomes crucial for workforce planning and policy. This study applies machine learning techniques to predict early retirement using Wave 7 of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), incorporating demographic, financial, social, and psychosocial predictors, including the CASP-19 quality-of-life scale. Four tree-based algorithms (CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest) were compared, with ensemble methods explored to optimize performance. XGBoost achieved optimal performance (ROC-AUC = 0.674, accuracy = 65%), while ensembles provided marginal improvements. Feature importance analysis revealed age as the dominant predictor, followed by aging attitudes, social connections, and financial stress. An ablation study showed CASP-19 adds minor incremental predictive value, with minimal performance decline when excluded. Application to working populations achieved 54% accuracy with self-reported retirement expectations, highlighting gaps between algorithmic predictions and individual intentions. These findings show comprehensive psychosocial assessment enhances prediction beyond traditional economic indicators, informing targeted workforce planning.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel framework for analyzing online offender mobility. Drawing on multidisciplinary insights, we extend two established criminological models for studying offline offending—the geometry of crime and crime journeys—by adapting their core concepts to cyberspace and developing a topology in which the cyber place is defined and becomes the unit of analysis. Just as offenders travel before, during, and after committing crime offline, we argue they also undertake trips before, during, and after committing cybercrime, and that like offline journeys these cybercrime journeys comprise identifiable and measurable components. We further distinguish between human journeys (what offenders perceive) and data journeys (what happens to the information they transmit). We explicitly demonstrate how concepts from the geometry of crime and crime journeys translate from offline to online crime and mobility. This approach enables the systematic formulation of research questions and the measurement of behavioral patterns, facilitating the generation and accumulation of knowledge on cybercrime offending. The paper illustrates the framework’s theoretical relevance within environmental criminology and its practical application for cybercrime analysis through concrete examples.",

          "abstract": "This article addresses a fundamental limitation in contemporary anthropological approaches to algorithmic systems: their reliance on representational frameworks that treat computation as mediating pre-existing social relations rather than participating in their ongoing constitution. Drawing on the ontological turn in anthropology, agential realism, and processual philosophy, I develop an analytical framework that recognizes algorithms as ontological mediators—entities whose operations participate directly in bringing into being the subjects, temporalities, and social relations they appear merely to process. I introduce three core concepts: ontological mediation, recursive capture, and algorithmic territorialization, supported by methodological innovations in processual ethnography. These tools offer anthropologists new approaches for understanding how computational systems participate in the ongoing constitution of social worlds while remaining attentive to lived experience and cultural meaning.",

          "abstract": "Scandal is often theorized as rupture: the exposure of wrongdoing that mobilizes outrage and restores accountability. Yet this revelatory model, rooted in liberal-democratic contexts, struggles to explain why scandals frequently deepen ambiguity, entrench polarization, or recalibrate legitimacy without resolution. This article develops the concept of scandal as ambivalent governance through three Philippine cases: the Dengvaxia vaccine controversy, Philippine Offshore Gaming Operations (POGOs), and corruption in flood-control projects of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). Building on recent work on trust cultures, relational sovereignties, and constructivation, I argue that scandals are communicative arenas where publics simultaneously affirm and contest authority, extending and withdrawing trust through cultural grammars. Ambivalence is not a democratic deficit but a constitutive condition of communicative life. By theorizing from the Philippines, the framework challenges liberal-democratic models while offering concepts that travel outward, rethinking scandal as a constitutive practice of governance across both South and North.",

          "authors": "WEI MENG",
          "abstract": "In open-source intelligence (OSINT) research, traditional risk identification methods reliant on expert scoring face growing challenges due to their high subjectivity, cost, and lack of scalability. This study aims to propose and validate an algorithmic framework that transcends expert judgment. Centered on truth discovery, weakly supervised learning, and learning-based ranking, it enables automated, explainable risk identification within complex, multi-source heterogeneous data. The study first constructs a hierarchical-quota sampling system, acquiring and deduplicating data from four source categories: institutional authorities, official statements, mainstream and international reports, and visual materials. Subsequently, a truth discovery algorithm estimates source credibility to replace expert weighting. Weakly supervised labeling functions generate initial annotations, which are then aggregated by generative models to form robust labels. Finally, a learning ranking model dynamically prioritizes risk trajectories, with explainability ensured through Explainable AI techniques (e.g., SHAP, Grad-CAM). Results demonstrate that this framework reliably identifies risk signals across multiple time windows and control conditions. The classifier achieves PR-AUC improvements exceeding expert baselines, with average absolute error in inflection point localization maintained below 1 hour. It exhibits high consistency and robustness across cross-domain datasets. The study concludes that algorithmic expert-scoring replacement not only excels in accuracy and efficiency but also significantly outperforms traditional models in transparency and reproducibility, offering a systematic, scalable, and cutting-edge approach for OSINT risk research.",

To address this gap, we analyze Reddit discussions of three major policies from Trump's early second presidency: the Department of Government Efficiency, Trump's tariffs, and the Big Beautiful Bill. Our approach combines three key elements: dictionary-based identification of policy considerations (developed with LLM assistance), permutation-based statistical testing to identify significant co-occurrences, and network visualization to map thematic clusters. These topic co-occurrence networks reveal the underlying structure of policy discourse on Reddit and illuminate how online political discussions are organized around predictable argumentative frameworks.",

          "authors": "Kajwan Ziaoddini",
          "abstract": "In November 2024, Iranian musicians Ali Akbar Moradi and Pejman Hadadi toured the US East Coast, performing compositions for the tanbur, a long-necked lute mainly used by the Yarsan followers in western Iran. Despite the largely identical musical content across the concerts, they were all labeled differently. In brochures, artists’ and emcees’ short introductions onstage, and more intimate chats after the concerts, their music might be identified as Iranian, Persian, Kurdish, and/or Yaresan. While some of these titles might be awkward or avoided in Iran due to sociopolitical concerns, they may be deemed suitable for promoting this music among American audiences or the Iranian diaspora in the United States.\nBy comparing the different labels used during Moradi’s 2024 East Coast tour and the way his recordings have been categorized in Iran, this paper examines how labeling processes reflect broader sociopolitical concerns and constraints. Drawing on theories of situational identity (Hall 1996), I argue that social contexts determine not only the way Moradi’s music has been categorized but also the connotations the same category may evoke among different demographics within and outside Iran. In this study, I use participant observation and unstructured interviews with artists and facilitators during and after the events, as well as investigating the labels used for Moradi’s previous recordings in online music streaming databases. This study shows how a seemingly innocuous concert series can serve as a lens for understanding Iran's complex sociopolitical landscape, ethnic/national factions, and ideological perspectives.",

However, achieving long-lasting behavior of this type has so far challenged policymakers. To make progress, we need a deeper understanding of the dynamics of people’s normative expectations regarding collectively beneficial behaviors. This study employs a controlled laboratory experiment to collect panel data on individuals’ normative expectations regarding contributions in a public goods (PG) game. Using the Krupka &amp; Weber’s 2013 method, we elicit participants’ normative expectations at three stages: before playing a repeated standard PG game, after completing the repeated PG game, and after playing a repeated PG game with social incentives activated through the threat of exclusion from non-financial group activities. By comparing these stages, we examine whether and how experienced group behavior in PG games within two distinct structured social contexts—one without and one with social incentives—shapes individuals’ normative expectations. Our findings indicate heterogeneity in how social norms are perceived and how normative expectations change in response to experienced group behaviors in the PG games. Normative expectations for socially beneficial actions tend to emerge when such group behavior conveys a normative signal (i.e., when non-financial social incentives lead to increased and sustained contributions), particularly when the social norm is initially perceived as being loose. This work contributes to the growing body of research on social norms by offering experimental evidence that advances our understanding of the factors that determine beneficial normative change.",

This challenging research context provides a methodological petri dish from which to examine common ethical challenges inherent in CBPR work. Here we discuss how praxis aligned with the concepts of relationality, embeddedness and embodiment contain both tension and promise in complex research contexts. We depict how relational authenticity was facilitated by flexibility and informal interactions and was further enhanced by deeply-engaged, physical presence that enkindled hope even when hope was hampered by limited agency.

          "abstract": "This essay employs a critical cultural analysis to examine Beres Hammond’s Putting Up Resistance as a thematically complete reggae composition. Grounded in Afro-Caribbean philosophy, Black radical thought, and Rastafarian epistemology, the analysis positions the song not merely as entertainment but as a cultural text and sonic archive of resistance. By engaging with Hammond’s lyrics, delivery, and thematic structure, the paper argues that the song exemplifies reggae’s emancipatory ethos through its synthesis of systemic critique, emotional and familial love, and a spirit of resilience. Methodologically, the paper combines lyrical close reading with historical and philosophical contextualisation, drawing on Caribbean and diasporic cultural studies to highlight reggae’s role as both critique and affirmation. Autobiographical reflection is incorporated not as a confession but as a methodological stance consistent with postpositivist traditions, situating the scholar within the interpretive framework of Caribbean intellectual praxis. Ultimately, Putting Up Resistance is presented as more than a song: it is a site of lived cultural production and a testament to reggae’s continuing capacity to articulate hope, resistance, and communal survival in the face of ongoing injustice.\nKeywords: Reggae music, Cultural resistance, Rastafarian epistemology, Caribbean cultural studies, Afro-Caribbean philosophy",

          "authors": "George Y. Nie",
          "abstract": "Markowitz (1952) asset risk (MAR) has long been challenged. First, as an impostor of asset risk, volatility captures the noise of asset risk over maturity that improperly reflects asset risk (which has to be measured over a unit of time length to be cumulative since asset holder’s risk approaches zero as the holding time length approaches zero). Second, we argue that asset risk approaches zero as distance approaches zero, and that asset risk drives volatility, but not vice versa, implying that asset risk cannot be diversified away. Third, support to MAR appears to arise from a confusion between asset value and wealth utility: the law of diminishing marginal utility supports that volatility reduces the latter. The above causes explain why CAPM and Fama-French models have long been struggling to price asset volatilities. To address the challenges, we propose that the gross volatility (variance), which includes the excess risk ALPHA, of realized (expected) asset value approaches zero as distance approaches zero. We delineate expected asset value (which asset risk impacts without a distribution) and risk volatility (which does not affect the former while following a blended normal distribution we proposed). Our asset risk for a specific asset excludes the macrorisk in Nie (2024a) that is tied to assets with a face value denominated by the currency. We show that equity price is the present value of a spanning bond, a payment spanning over the predictable lifetime of firm performance, and that options are equity bonds. Our examples show how to compute a firm’s debt and equity risk. Our asset risk, captured as risk premium, solves issues that have long been challenging agency theories, thereby redefining firm misvaluation theory.",

Expecting that the T-bill risk largely reflects a country’s inflation risk or macrorisk, we measure the risk as a one-year payment’s risk to be comparable across various assets. We suggest that the risk-free rate approximately reflects the expected inflation effect, and that the inflation risk reflects the unexpected inflation effect or investment opportunity cost. To simplify the formulas, we also examine if the two returns can be computed independently. We employ two factors to model the risk-free rate, which the market expects the current monetary policy to bring towards the neutral level over a certain period. The 4-factor models include a factor constant over maturity to capture the depreciation cost of inter-bank short-term lending. We thus use different models to split T-bill returns into the risk and the risk-free rate with repeated trials to minimize the prediction errors, thereby solving the model factors. The 4-factor independence model outperforms all the other models on average explaining 99.3% of the US T-bill returns. The T-bill metrics represent the gateway to the risks of various corporate assets.",

          "abstract": "Persistent macroeconomic imbalances, long‑run deflation, and entrenched inequality are often interpreted as outcomes of market incompleteness or failures. This paper offers an alternative perspective by developing a dynamic equilibrium framework for open economies that incorporates asset‑side mechanisms. Within this framework, and by re‑examining the transversality condition (TVC) as an asset‑valuation criterion, such persistent imbalances can emerge as structural outcomes of optimal behavior rather than anomalies. The model yields the relationship:Rt-ρ=n+Da-U(θa)/Uc; This relationship shows that the gap between the asset return (Rt) and time preference (ρ) is sustained by the combined effects of capital diffusion (Da), population growth (n) and preference terms (U(θa)/Uc). This reinterpretation explains how steady states with persistent differences in asset levels and external balances can coexist, and frames equilibrium as a dynamic configuration shaped by interdependence across economies and agents, beyond the traditional price‑clearing mechanism. The results align theory with observed realities and offer tools for policy design, including structural selection of the steady state, policy control of capital flows, and asset‑dynamics‑based policy reconstruction.",

          "abstract": "This paper, based on three research vignettes featuring methodological reflections from visual and multisensory research on international migrations conducted in Norway and Poland, introduces the concept of multisensory positionality. Grounded in the theoretical discussions around positionality developed in migration studies (Anthias 2002, 2008, 2020; Yuval-Davis 2006), and supported by sensuous scholarship (Stoller 2010; Howes 2020), multisensory positionality is a holistic, intersectional approach that recognises the body and senses as crucial aspects of positionality for both the researcher and participants. The paper highlights how these embodied experiences actively shape the negotiation of meaning between people and spaces, both in a research context and as part of the migration experience. As an analytical concept, multisensory positionality addresses the opportunities and limitations arising from the embodied, multisensory experiences of the research participants. It bridges migration and sensory studies by situating the sensory aspects of people’s identities within their broader life-worlds, including the impact of structures and power relations. \nKeywords: Multisensory Positionality, Migration, Positionality, Creative Research, Visual Methodologies.",

Women more often prioritized Ph.D. completion before age 30 and transitioned to parenthood after 35, whereas men tended to become parents during doctoral studies, often with three or more children by age 40. Early parenthood was associated with the largest gender gaps in long-term scientific citations, favoring men; these disparities disappeared among those who became parents after age 35. Men were also more likely to secure and remain in academic positions regardless of parenthood timing. These findings highlight persistent challenges for early-career mothers and underscore the need for institutional policies to better support parenting responsibilities alongside career progression.",

          "abstract": "Loneliness is a growing public health concern with a wide-range of impacts on mental and physical well-being. While most interventions adopt a uniform, one-size-fits-all approach, emerging evidence suggests that the effectiveness of loneliness interventions depends on individual psychological traits and the structure of social environments. Previous work has shown that mental health outcomes are shaped not only by personal vulnerabilities but also by complex feedback processes embedded in social networks. However, it remains unclear which types of interventions work best for which individuals, and how social context modulates these effects. We develop and apply an agent-based model that simulates mental health on a continuum with loneliness as a latent state at its lower end. The model is shaped by baseline resilience, self-reinforcement, and social influence mechanisms, across a realistic synthetic population. We target these mechanisms for specific individuals and varying proportions of their social networks. Outcomes for the individual and sequential neighbors are compared to a counterfactual. We use a random forest model and compute SHAP values that identify which features of the individuals and their social networks predict intervention success.\nWe show that interventions improving baseline resilience consistently benefit individuals, particularly those with low socioeconomic status embedded in moderately diverse networks. In contrast, interventions targeting self-reinforcement or peer influence exhibit greater variability and may produce adverse effects in overly homogeneous or fragmented contexts. Surprisingly, classical network centrality metrics fail to explain these patterns; instead, similarity in baseline and mental health traits across social layers emerges as a strong predictor of intervention efficacy.\nThese findings suggest that personalization based on social and psychological similarity is more informative than topological metrics when designing interventions for loneliness. The results challenge assumptions about “scaling up” interventions and highlight the importance of tailoring to social context and individual vulnerability. \nMore broadly, our approach demonstrates how computational models  can capture the complex interplay between individual traits and cumulative, self-consistent social feedbacks, offering a concrete framework for designing socially aware, targeted public health interventions.",

          "abstract": "Це препринт матеріалу, поданого для публікації в журналі «Empirio», що видається Національним університетом Києво-Могилянська академія.\n\nНа прикладі України стаття уточнює концептуальний підхід до стратегічного планування міжнародної допомоги поза межами гуманітарного реагування. Показано, що мотиви донорів не пояснюються однією теорією міжнародних відносин, натомість потрібна синтезована оптика, яка поєднує ліберальні, реалістичні, конструктивістські і критичні підходи з тристороннім нексусом (Humanitarian-Development-Peacebuilding: гуманітарно-розвитково-миробудівним). На цьому перетині формується портфельна логіка, що передбачає охоплення всіх трьох компонентів нексуса, мінімізуючи ризик ігнорування будь-якого з них. Теоретичний синтез ілюструється підходами ЄС, Північної Європи, Великої Британії, США та інших донорів, де темпи й масштаби підтримки визначаються поєднанням географії загроз, політичних циклів, оборонно-промислових спроможностей й умовності реформ. У цій моделі розбудову миру замінює «мирочутливість», яка пріоритезує програми, що зміцнюють соціальну гармонію та згуртованість.\nПрактичним внеском роботи є аналітична «матриця HDP × мотивації донорів», яка систематизує типи нелетальних інтервенцій на перетині чотирьох логік і трьох напрямів HDP. Вона демонструє, як операціоналізувати заявлені мотиви у результати, спрямовані на позитивну зміну: від правових послуг і прозорих реєстрів до захисту цивільних, розвитку людського капіталу, інклюзивних діалогів та локалізації проєктів. Ключова умова ефективності це поєднання невідкладних і структурних інтервенцій на основі довгострокового фінансування, локалізації та прозорого управління.\nСтаття також окреслює типові вузькі місця імплементації нексуса у воєнних і післявоєнних умовах, а саме фрагментацію координації, несумісність бюджетно-правових рамок, різні часові горизонти та дефіцит даних. Запропоновані механізми їх подолання через спільні очікувані результати, уніфіковані підходи до моніторингу, відкриті дані та залучення громад до рішень. Таким чином, робота пропонує cпосіб перетворення різнорідних мотивацій донорів на спільні траєкторії стабілізації та відновлення, підвищуючи довіру між донорами й реципієнтами та знижуючи ризики довгострокової залежності від допомоги.",

          "authors": "Kim yunwoo; Junhyuk Hwang",
          "abstract": "Existing ESG ratings have limitations like disclosure delays, inconsistencies, and uneven coverage,\nparticularly in non-English markets. This paper addresses these issues by establishing the first machine learning benchmark for ESG prediction in the Korean market using news-derived time-series features. A standardized dataset of 278 Korean firms was constructed, and monthly sentiment and ESG-relevance features were generated from news using Korean-specific language models. A mask-aware CNN explicitly handles missing data by distinguishing observed months from imputed ones. The model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 17.9, a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 22.0, an 𝑅2 of 0.12, and a Spearman’s 𝜌 of 0.38, demonstrating that temporal modeling and explicit handling of missing data are crucial for improving predictive accuracy.",

          "authors": "JOHN CHIWUZULUM ODOZI",
          "abstract": "The substantial number of food-insecure households in Nigeria and the problem of regional and socioeconomic disparities in food security are raising issues of food system transformation and justice. While knowledge of the gap is of public interest, the empirical validation of the gap is scant and the components of the gap linked to differences in socioeconomic characteristics and income inequality have not been investigated for Nigeria. This paper investigated the socioeconomic disparity in food security and a child’s diet quality. The specific objectives were (1) to profile the socioeconomic inequalities in food security and a child’s diet quality, and (2) to determine the relationship between food insecurity and a child’s dietary quality. The study employed Round 6 of the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS6) data for Nigeria. A model was specified using a two-stage least-squares (2SLS) regression and analyzed using Stata MP Version 14. Results revealed 80.53% of households were food insecure, with a more pronounced estimate for the rural sector (81.95%) compared to the urban sector (78.08%). This was found to be statistically significant. As wealth ranking of households increased from poorest to richest, the proportion of households in food insecurity declined for the rural sample and for the pooled. The regression result showed that food insecurity decreased the likelihood of children having a quality diet and was statistically significant for rural areas and for the pooled sample (National). Thus, promoting programmes that enhance food access, availability, and utilization, targeted at the rural and urban poor, as well as diverse diets for children, are paramount",

          "authors": "Takaaki Fujita",
          "abstract": "Graph theory has been widely applied across diverse scientific domains [1, 2]. Hypergraphs extend classical\ngraphs by allowing hyperedges to connect arbitrary subsets of vertices, while superhypergraphs further enrich\nthis structure through iterated powersets that capture hierarchical and self-referential relationships [3, 4]. An\nactor network links heterogeneous actants—humans, artifacts, texts, and rules—through directed associations,\nemphasizing relational materiality and performative agency [5,6]. An urban road network is a directed, weighted\ngraph of intersections and road segments, modeling connectivity, capacities, and travel dynamics. In this paper,\nwe extend actor networks and urban road networks by employing HyperGraphs and SuperHyperGraphs. These\nextensions are expected to provide clearer and more expressive representations of hierarchical structures in\nreal-world actor networks and urban road networks.",

          "authors": "Arvid Lindh",
          "abstract": "The study examines two dimensions of inequality acceptance in Sweden: income differences and welfare chauvinism, as well as their association with populist attitudes. Based on original survey data collected from 2019 to 2022 (three pooled cross-sections, random samples of the adult population), the study reveals substantial social (by class) and political (by partisanship) divides regarding how redistributive ambitious and socially inclusive the welfare state should be, challenging assumptions of strong sociopolitical consensus. Welfare chauvinism is found to be more politically divisive than approval of income differences, with the sharpest divides emerging in the exclusivist conceptions of social rights and welfare deservingness held by voters of the non-mainstream (radical) right party, the Sweden Democrats. The results suggest that conflicts over inclusivist versus exclusivist conceptions of social rights and welfare deservingness could become central in Swedish politics, potentially shifting away from the universalist principles that underpin its social democratic welfare state model.",

          "title": "Household Labour Productivity Gap in Rural Nigeria: Farm versus Non-Farm",
          "authors": "JOHN CHIWUZULUM ODOZI",
          "abstract": "The issue of labour productivity and the differential between countries and sectors is well established in the literature. The literature finds a wide gap in labour productivity between sectors, but there is limited empirical evidence for rural Nigeria. This paper examined the nature of labour productivity in rural Nigeria using Nigeria’s national data and a regression-based decomposition technique.  Overall, the paper found that labour use in the farm sector was 17% less productive than labour in the nonfarm sector.  From the regression results, factors such as years of schooling, age as a measure of experience, household size, land size, access to social infrastructure and urbanization, and technical change contributed to driving the labour productivity gap in rural Nigeria. From the results, education, social capital, and infrastructure matter for labour productivity and earnings convergence between farm and nonfarm sectors. Rural development programmes addressing these problems will significantly contribute to a better business environment to increase labour productivity.",

          "abstract": "This study aims to conduct a systematic assessment of the ‘red circle and white chairs’ incident at Wuhan University's 2025 commencement ceremony and its broader context within Sino-Japanese exchanges through open-source intelligence (OSINT) methodologies. The objective is to uncover potential cultural narrative risks and pathways of external influence. Methodologically, the study combines Competitive Hypothesis Analysis (CHA) with red team logic modelling, embedding the STEMPLES framework (Symbols, Timing, Events, Information, Processes, Leadership, Externalities, Structure) to conduct a multidimensional analysis of the event's symbolic risks, narrative imbalances, process vulnerabilities, and leadership behaviour. Findings indicate that the Wuhan University Party Committee's high-frequency exchanges with Japan between 2019 and 2025, coupled with the semi-autonomous operational mechanism of the Japanese alumni association, provided ‘soft influence pathways’ for cultural infiltration and misinterpretation of public discourse. The ‘red circle + white chair’ design, interpreted by the public as symbolising the ‘Japanese flag,’ exposed deficiencies in political sensitivity oversight during major ceremonies. Although no conclusive hostile intelligence networks or financial irregularities were identified, evidence indicates that uncontrolled symbolism and narrative gaps amplified opportunities for external narrative manipulation. In conclusion, this paper advocates establishing cross-departmental risk mitigation mechanisms to strengthen political security reviews of visual and narrative design. This should form a closed-loop system comprising ‘pre-event screening, in-process intervention, and symmetrical post-event responses’ to prevent symbolic missteps from strategic exploitation. Such measures offer valuable insights for universities' security governance in international cooperation and cultural exchange.",

          "authors": "Seth T. Kannarr",
          "abstract": "America’s ‘National Parks’ are natural landscapes of wild flora and fauna that serve as highly-desired recreational destinations for people from around the world today. However, we tend to be unaware that these protected areas have a forgotten history of domicide, or the deliberate destruction of homes and dwellings. Prior to formal establishment and designation as ‘National Parks’, these beautiful geographic areas were landscapes of home and housing across human time. In this work, I explore the notion of ‘National Parks’ as home and ponder the following three reflective questions: How has the establishment of ‘National Parks’ served as a form of domicide? Are protected areas being protected for all people or from certain people? How are people included and excluded from home in U.S. ‘National Parks’ today?",
