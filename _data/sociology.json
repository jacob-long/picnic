          "title": "How public benefits make citizens in Latino mixed-status families: self-efficacy, institutional engagement, and concerted citizenship cultivation",
          "authors": "Luis Edward Tenorio",
          "abstract": "Experiences with public benefits can shape recipients’ feelings (belonging) and enactment of citizenship (e.g., political, civic, or economic behaviors). However, we know less about how undocumented and lawful permanent resident (LPR) immigrants fit within this paradigm. This study, based on in-depth interviews with forty working-poor undocumented and LPR Latina immigrant mothers, reveals striking ways in which mothers described the meanings they attached to the benefits received and the social processes their experiences with benefit programs informed. Many mothers described an increased sense of self-efficacy as mothers and as immigrants, expanded notions of government responsiveness, and shifts in how they understood the citizenship (broadly conceived) of their children based on their experiences with benefits. This was even reported among mothers who used programs often seen as stigmatizing or who had challenges arise in petitioning for benefits. Moreover, mothers conveyed these meanings spurring legal, economic, and civic behavioral adaptations in their lives, deepening their engagement as citizens. They also described how the meanings derived from benefits use produced changes in their parenting practices, describing structuring their children’s time and engagement with institutions, as well as fostering reasoning skills and attitudes meant to benefit their children’s long-term integration. I term such practices concerted citizenship cultivation. For children with legal citizenship, concerted citizenship cultivation focused on developing comfort and entitlement within US institutions, socializing interactions with authority figures, and promoting expanded engagement in society. For children who lacked legal citizenship, concerted citizenship cultivation focused on developing positive identity and deepening engagement within protective institutions.",

          "title": "Equality takes work: a process to understand why women still do most of the household labor",
          "authors": "Inés Martínez Echagüe",
          "abstract": "In the United States, widespread support for gender egalitarianism in the household contrasts with the pattern that women continue to do more household labor than men in different-sex relationships. Existing scholarship has revealed the ways in which different-sex couples justify these unequal arrangements. However, we know little about why women do more labor even when they have egalitarian goals and few structural constraints. I address this question by examining whether and how couples attempt to achieve equality and why they so often fail. Data from 40 in-depth interviews with members of 20 cisgender, different-sex, college-educated couples show that, because unequal household labor patterns are so entrenched, having an egalitarian division of labor itself requires work. I theorize and provide evidence for a process I call “equality work,” the work of creating an egalitarian division of labor, which often falls on women. Equality work includes anticipating inequality, strategizing to avoid it, monitoring equality, speaking up about inequality, fixing unequal outcomes, and withholding work. When men don’t strive for equality, women preserve the relationship by doing the labor their partners do not and revising their ideals. Equality work helps us better understand why women do most of the household labor; paradoxically, doing less requires that women work as well. These findings suggest that women are not passively accepting unequal household arrangements but striving to change them.",

          "authors": "Xiaohan Wu, Margaret E. Roberts, Rachel E. Stern, Benjamin L. Liebman, Amarnath Gupta, Luke Sanford",
          "abstract": "Courts around the world are putting their data online, making information about caseloads, parties, and decisions available to the public. Yet, this data is far from complete, and often only reflects a portion of courts’ dockets. We offer and validate a set of tools for leveraging serialized bureaucratic data from courts to estimate the proportion of cases available to the public and the time courts take to make decisions. Using data from more than 3,000 courts in China, our methods allow us to assess patterns of missingness in court data across provinces and cities by type of case and to conduct the largest quantitative analysis to date on court delay in China. By providing an extensive validation of both new and existing tools for estimating missingness and delay, we provide a set of recommendations for researchers looking to augment incomplete bureaucratic data around the world.",

          "title": "Xenophobic and Islamophobic Rhetoric among Evangelical Opinion Leaders in the Age of Trump",
          "authors": "Joseph Roso",
          "abstract": "Filled with anti-immigrant and Islamophobic rhetoric and buoyed by overwhelming support from white evangelicals, Donald Trump’s campaign for the presidency shocked the world. Much media coverage and scholarship on Trump’s evangelical support implicitly bought into his populist myth of representing the “legitimate” people who ultimately forced the evangelical elite to come around to their point of view. However, little systematic research has been done investigating whether evangelical leaders changed their rhetoric on immigration and Islam following Trump’s rise to political power or if xenophobic rhetoric was already a feature of evangelical media. To address this question, the author collected a corpus of more than 45,000 articles from prominent online evangelical news Web sites and used text analysis techniques to analyze how evangelical opinion leaders discussed immigration and Islam. Evangelical opinion leaders were already using frames of threat and foreignness in their rhetoric around immigration and Islam even before Trump announced his candidacy for president, and there was little change in this rhetoric following his rise to power. These findings suggest that Trump did not instill xenophobic and Islamophobic views in his followers but instead tapped into ideas that were already prevalent in the evangelical subculture.",

          "authors": "Marion C. Harper, Laura McKinney, Michael Restivo, John M. Shandra, Jamie M. Sommer",
          "abstract": "The authors draw on environmental state theory to inform this study, examining the relationship between public payment for ecosystem services programs and forest loss from 2001 to 2015 in low- and middle-income nations. The authors analyze data for a sample of 79 low- and middle-income nations using a two-stage fractional regression model to address the potential issue of endogeneity on the public payment for ecosystem services program measures. The authors find support for environmental state theory that higher levels of payments to users as part of public payment for ecosystem services programs correspond to less forest loss in low- and middle-income nations. The authors also find that a composite variable, which measures key characteristics that may enhance the effectiveness of public payment for ecosystem services programs, has a similar relationship with forest loss in low- and middle-income nations. The authors conclude by discussing the theoretical, methodological, and policy implications of these findings.",
