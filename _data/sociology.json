          "authors": "Jonathan S Coley, Gabby Gomez",
          "abstract": "Do organizations that previously discriminated against one marginalized group go on to discriminate against other marginalized groups? If so, why and under what conditions? We address this question by developing a theory of transmorphic organizations, which suggests that organizations’ likelihood of discriminating against different groups over time will be contingent on their associated moral schemas and organizational identities. We test this theory by analyzing a unique, comprehensive dataset of discriminatory policies at 526 Christian colleges and universities in the United States, a set of organizations that has routinely been exempted from federal non-discrimination policies. Through logistic regression analyses, we uncover an association between schools’ historical policies on race and contemporary policies on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) students among certain types of Christian colleges and universities. Specifically, evangelical Protestant colleges and universities that discriminated against Black students typically formally discriminate against LGBTQ students, whereas mainline Protestant and Catholic colleges and universities that discriminated against Black students rarely formally discriminate against LGBTQ students. We attribute this divergence to the increasingly conservative, individualist moral schemas of evangelical Protestants in general and the relatively exclusive organizational identities of evangelical Protestant colleges and universities. Our study’s findings hold implications for organizational theories of inequality and contribute to ongoing research on religion, race, LGBTQ rights, and higher education.",

          "authors": "Artur Pokropek, Tomasz Żółtak, Eldad Davidov, Bart Meuleman, Peter Schmidt",
          "abstract": "Multilevel modelling (MM) is widely utilized in the social sciences, with over 20% of articles in leading sociological journals employing this technique. Despite its prevalence, few studies address whether the variables used in MM are invariant across groups or allow to construct reliable indicators. This study investigates the effects of both measurement noninvariance and random measurement error on MM using Monte Carlo simulations. Our findings reveal significant biases in MM results when random measurement errors are overlooked. Attaining high reliability in the indicators – above 0.94 – can mitigate these biases. While measurement noninvariance introduces bias in MM, its impact is smaller compared to that of the bias caused by unaddressed measurement error. Multilevel structural equation modelling (SEM), which controls for random measurement errors, performs effectively in complete measurement invariance (MI) scenarios. However, the absence of MI can create significant challenges. While multilevel SEM is a powerful analytical tool, it is not immune to the effects of MI assumption violations.",

          "abstract": "Age-period-cohort analysis is often done in the context of two samples. This could be samples for women and men or for two countries. It is of interest to ask if some time effects could be common across samples. We clarify how the well-known age-period-cohort problem for one sample carries over to the two sample situation. This is done through a reparametrization in terms of parameters that are invariant to the identification issues. The new parametrization shows which hypotheses can be tested and their degrees of freedom. Testable hypotheses can be formulated for non-linear effects, but not for the linear parts of the individual time effects. This conclusion remains when imposing cross-sample restrictions. The analysis is extended to the mixed frequency situation where age and period are measured at different scales. As an empirical illustration a study of Swiss suicide rates is revisited.",
