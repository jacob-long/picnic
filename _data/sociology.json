          "title": "Colonial legacy and contemporary civil violence: a global study from 1960 to 2018",
          "authors": "Christopher Kollmeyer",
          "abstract": "This study assesses whether the legacy of colonialism continues to influence patterns of civil violence in the contemporary era. A large and established quantitative literature attributes civil violence to low levels of economic development and limited political rights, but few quantitative studies consider whether colonial legacy plays an enduring role in such conflicts. This is surprising given the substantial evidence showing that colonialism impeded long-run development in many parts of the world. Drawing on ideas from macro-comparative sociology, institutional economics, and political science, the study develops several theoretical expectations regarding colonialism’s effect on contemporary civil violence. These ideas are tested with a global sample of 152 countries observed annually from 1960 to 2018. Results from logistic regression models support the contention that (1) post-colonial societies are more prone to civil violence than non-colonized societies, that (2) ex-British colonies are especially prone to ethnic-based civil violence while ex-Spanish colonies are especially prone to socio-economic-based civil violence, and that (3) these historical effects change and evolve but never fully abate. This latter finding implies that elevated levels of civil violence are a path-dependent legacy of colonialism. The study ends by running robustness checks and discussing the theoretical implications of the study’s findings, in particular reflecting on our understanding of the long-run consequences of colonialism.",

          "title": "Gentrification in small cities: growth coalitions, civic engagement, and political participation",
          "authors": "Richard E Ocejo",
          "abstract": "Most gentrification research uses large cities as cases to make sense of how the process unfolds, while studies of gentrification in nonmetropolises tend to focus on the process’s similarities across differently-sized municipalities. Unexplained is how the distinct characteristics of differently-sized places inform how the process unfolds. Based on interviews with eighty-five stakeholders and four years of ethnographic fieldwork in a small city experiencing gentrification, this article advances a new understanding of the process by analyzing and theorizing the role of scale in shaping the social and political dynamics behind it. It argues that gentrification in small cities is different from what the process looks like in other places for two reasons. First, they offer conditions that facilitate small-scale actors who wish to form gentrification stakeholder-led growth coalitions. Second, they offer opportunities for these actors to get civically and politically involved in municipal government in direct, influential ways. While in decision-making roles, they effectively help to advance gentrification in their neighborhoods to better suit their economic interests and cultural preferences. By focusing on how place characteristics structure urban processes, specifically conditions in gentrifying small cities, and this article reveals the distinct features of gentrification in nonmetropolises.",

          "title": "Breathing unequal air: environmental disadvantage and residential sorting of immigrant minorities in England and Germany",
          "authors": "Tobias Rüttenauer, Felix Bader, Ingmar Ehler, Henning Best",
          "abstract": "Despite ongoing debates on environmental justice, the link between selective residential migration and the unequal exposure to environmental hazards remains underexplored. Previous research has often relied on spatially aggregated data and focused on single-country analyses, limiting our understanding of broader patterns. We address this gap using longitudinal household-level data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study and the German Socio-Economic Panel linked to air pollution estimates (NO2, PM2.5, and SO2). We find that immigrant minorities are exposed to higher levels of air pollution at their place of residence. The overall disadvantage faced by immigrant minorities in England is three times as large as in Germany. Given that immigrant households start under initially higher levels of air pollution, one would expect convergence with non-immigrant populations over time due to residential moves. However, immigrants face a substantial penalty when moving. If native households started in similar neighborhoods as immigrants—the relevant counterfactual—they would experience higher gains from relocation. Socio-economic factors cannot explain these differences. The pattern holds in both England and Germany, although inequalities in residential mobility are more pronounced in England. In particular, racial and ethnic minorities, such as Bangladeshi, Caribbean, and African migrants in England and Turkish migrants in Germany, experience the largest environmental disadvantages.",
