          "title": "The Perils and Promises of Unequal Democracy: Insights from the Sociology of India",
          "authors": "Rina Agarwala, Poulami Roychowdhury",
          "abstract": "Why has India, the world's largest liberal democracy, joined the global turn toward authoritarianism? Drawing on the sociological literature on Indian politics, we argue that India's authoritarian turn emerges from the difficulty of sustaining democracy within an unequal society. The Indian state historically managed this difficulty by balancing the interests of opposed social groups: responding favorably to underprivileged groups’ demands for welfare and rights while simultaneously maintaining elite power and privilege. This approach ensured that everyone enjoyed some wins but also faced some disappointments. For decades, the Indian state's ability to sustain this juggling act was credited for the success of India's liberal democracy. Over time, however, the Indian state's attempt to appease opposed social groups became perilous for democracy. The more the state catered to elite and nonelite demands, the more empowered both groups became to express their dissatisfaction and demand more. Elites, resentful that their privilege was being chipped away to make room for nonelites, and nonelites, frustrated with continued poverty and marginalization at the hands of elites, both began seeking solutions from an alternative, authoritarian-style regime. Recent events suggest that one ray of hope for a more just future in India resides in the social movements that emerged from India's democracy and have recently tried to hold its increasingly authoritarian regime in check. By tracing the social basis of India's democratic fluctuations, sociological literature on India provides important insights for other unequal democracies, where similar elite resentments and nonelite frustrations are fueling authoritarianism.",

          "title": "An unbreakable bond? Maternal adverse childhood experiences and mothers’ relationships with adult children",
          "authors": "Lawrence Stacey, Rin Reczek, Kristi Williams, Jake Hays, Mieke Beth Thomeer",
          "abstract": "Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs)—the constellation of experiences of abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction in childhood—affect the subsequent formation and maintenance of social relationships. Yet to date, there is limited knowledge on the potential consequences of maternal ACEs for the mother–adult child tie, one of the most important relationships across the life course. Insights from a life course perspective and research on the deleterious effects of ACEs suggest that mothers’ experiences of ACEs in childhood are so powerful that they may shape mother–adult child relationship quality decades later. To test this possibility, we draw on nationally representative, longitudinal cohort data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) and the NLSY79 Child and Young Adult Supplement to examine associations between maternal ACEs and mother–adult child estrangement, contact, and closeness. Multi-level logistic and ordinal logistic regression models show that greater maternal ACEs exposure is associated with greater odds of estrangement from, less frequent contact with, and lower levels of closeness to the mother as reported by the adult child. Our findings highlight and extend research on intergenerational relationships by demonstrating that a mother’s ACEs exposure may be a fundamental determinant of her relationships with her adult children, documenting lengthier intergenerational consequences of ACEs than uncovered by prior research.",

          "title": "Who gets a second chance? Compliance, classification, and criminal conviction",
          "authors": "Lindsay Bing, Carmen Gutierrez",
          "abstract": "Felony conviction carries lifelong consequences that impact civic, economic, and social rights and opportunities, yet not everyone who is found guilty of a felony will bear the mark of conviction. Deferred adjudication is an increasingly popular intervention that offers legally guilty defendants protection from the mark of conviction conditional on the completion of community supervision. By conditioning conviction on discretionary assessments of compliance, rather than legal establishment of guilt, deferral and similar interventions may exacerbate inequality and further concentrate the mark of conviction among marginalized groups. However, relatively few studies examine disparities in the decision to defer conviction and dismiss charges. In this study, we draw on twenty years of court records to ask “for whom is the mark of conviction and formal punishment dependent on compliance rather than the legal establishment of guilt, and who passes the test of compliance?” Findings reveal that, even when accounting for features of the offense, both race and socioeconomic status condition who gets a “second chance” at a clean record. These findings have implications for how we study inequality in criminal courts and understand the production and meaning of conviction.",
