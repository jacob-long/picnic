          "authors": "Tyson H. Brown, Patricia Homan, Victor Ray",
          "abstract": "This review provides 10 actionable recommendations for advancing the scientific study of structural racism through theoretically grounded and empirically robust measures and methods. By offering conceptual and analytical clarity, these recommendations aim to enhance research rigor on the structure and function of racism. For each recommendation, we ( a ) delineate key theoretical principles tied to specific features of structural racism, ( b ) evaluate the strengths and limitations of existing measures and methods, and ( c ) propose best practices for measurement and modeling that align with theory and rigorous methodologies. Given the complex, multifaceted, and dynamic nature of structural racism, we emphasize the necessity of embracing epistemological and methodological pluralism. Scholars are encouraged to integrate insights through triangulation by leveraging diverse theoretical frameworks, varied data sources, and a wide array of methods. The review concludes by addressing pressing challenges and identifying opportunities for innovative research to deepen our understanding of structural racism and its enduring impacts in racialized societies.",

          "title": "Bureaucracy in Action: The Sociology of Public Administration",
          "authors": "Erin Metz McDonnell",
          "abstract": "This review articulates sociology's emerging approach to public administration, building on long-standing interest in bureaucracy. The sociology of public administration aims to understand how public administration perpetuates or mitigates inequalities through how well it performs (or does not) and for whom—balancing interest in performance and inclusivity. Sociological work on public administration has exploded in the past decade, illuminating the internal workings of the state apparatus and interrogating microlevel practices of governance, administration, and the chains by which policy comes to be enacted and experienced in the lives of citizens. This scholarship has concentrated around three themes: ( a ) public administration as a fragmented patchwork with high variation in performance, including administrative burdens that disproportionately affect marginalized groups; ( b ) public administration as a social arena with blurred boundaries, with unclear and negotiated jurisdictions for action, and where interpersonal and interorganizational connections have equivocal effects on the work of the state; and ( c ) understanding public administration as socially constituted, not only by rules on paper but by the people who do the work of the state, bringing identities, experiences, cognition, and cultural understandings to bear. The article also includes a supplemental appendix discussing public administration's role in institutionalizing categories that permeate everyday life, producing both legibility and illegibility.",

          "abstract": "What are human rights? Although legal scholars point to a growing list of international entitlements, social scientists have highlighted underlying ideological assumptions and the selective interpretation of human rights in practice. Lay conceptualizations of human rights, however, merit further examination. This study brings together human rights research and cognitive sociology, deploying a novel, online task-based study to explore the content and structure of human rights as a lay category of thought. To do so, the authors examine rights exemplars, perceived violations, goodness of fit, and response times in a sample of adults in the United States. The findings suggest that freedom of speech is a cognitive prototype. Civil and political rights were prominent in respondents’ minds relative to economic, social, and cultural rights. There were substantive exceptions in both directions; certain political rights, such as asylum, were peripheral or dismissed from the human rights concept, while health care, food, and education were salient. Results indicate that respondents were disposed to include content within the human rights category when asked. This study garners insights on how ordinary people perceive and understand human rights in the United States, breaking ground for further comparative research.",
