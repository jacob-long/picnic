          "title": "Fabricating Communists: The Imagined Third That Reinvented the National Fault Line in Mid-Twentieth-Century Colombia’s Civil War",
          "authors": "Laura Acosta",
          "abstract": "Contrary to the classical sociological view that social conflict reinforces preexisting political divisions, this article argues that civil war can reinvent them. I examine this phenomenon through the evolution of civil wars in Colombia in the mid-twentieth century, a period initially marked by a Liberal–Conservative conflict that developed into a civil war between the state and communist guerrillas. Drawing on archival records, oral histories of civilians and combatants, and newspapers, I demonstrate that when one party invents an “imagined third”—an actor, external to the original conflict dyad, who lacks any connection to an actual military or political threat—to blame for the violence in civil war, a self-fulfilling logic turns the imagined third into a tangible enemy of the nation, thereby creating a new fault line. In Colombia, politicians’ baseless accusations and preemptive actions against Communists activated three mechanisms of fault line formation—enemy legitimation, boundary demarcation, and identity shift—that materialized the very revolutionary threats they claimed to prevent. This analytic framework of fault line formation in civil war opens new avenues for examining how political discourse can become self-fulfilling, how international threats are transformed into local enemies, and how wartime actors’ opportunities for action evolve—including the conditions necessary for sustained peace.",

          "title": "The Cultural Devaluation of Feminized Work: The Evolution of U.S. Occupational Prestige and Gender Typing in Linguistic Representations, 1900 to 2019",
          "authors": "Wenhao Jiang",
          "abstract": "Previous research on occupational devaluation typically evaluates the potential wage declines associated with a significant inflow of women into an occupation; results have been mixed. Few studies, however, examine the cultural mechanism central to the thesis, where an occupation’s symbolic value in multiple dimensions changes in response to the dynamics of its cultural association with women. This article proposes a new semantic approach to trace the devaluation process in U.S. culture, where occupation titles appear in scholarly and public discourses with varied semantic proximity to gender- and prestige-signaling phrases over time. Decade-specific occupation embedding (1900 to 2019) from 127 billion words of American English across genres and a novel fixed-effects estimator show a latent cultural bias against women’s work, such that an occupation’s general prestige and perceived potency (but not its moral standing) declines when it becomes increasingly stereotyped as female. The largest penalties are found in lower- and middle-wage occupations; most high-wage occupations, despite experiencing large increases in female share in recent years, are persistently stereotyped as male professions without a prestige loss. In total, the cultural mechanism of devaluation accounts for 22.4 to 25.9 percent of the observed negative link between occupations’ female typing and hourly wages.",

          "title": "When expectations backfire: educational differences in declining destination attachment among recent immigrants",
          "authors": "Andreas Genoni, Didier Ruedin",
          "abstract": "Immigrants with higher levels of education tend to report more discrimination and a weaker attachment to their destination country than immigrants with lower levels of education. This so-called integration paradox may be caused by two basic, mutually independent mechanisms: highly educated immigrants (1) more often experience unmet migration expectations, and (2) show stronger negative reactions when their expectations about their life abroad are not met. Existing research mainly focused on the first mechanism, while empirically tracing the second has been hampered by a lack of evidence comparing less- and more-educated immigrants over time. Here, we address this gap and examine how unmet migration expectations contribute to education-related differences in destination attachment. The mechanism we investigate is rooted in the educational background, but migration amplifies the dynamics, contributing to higher hopes while confronting individuals with unpredictable realities and limited control. Using panel data on recent immigrants to Switzerland from the Swiss Migration-Mobility Survey (N = 5242 immigrants and 13,890 observations, 2016–2022), we assessed the extent of unmet expectations and associated disappointment through a question on dissatisfaction with the decision to migrate. Consistent with theory, we found that increasingly negative evaluations of the migration decision were linked to reduced destination attachment, especially for immigrants with higher levels of education. Analyses further revealed that these detrimental reactions were not limited to immigrants with distinct ethno-racial background. These results suggest a fundamental mechanism for the emergence of the integration paradox, enhancing our understanding of educational inequalities in expectation management and immigrant integration.",

          "abstract": "Explanations for police behavior argue that “us versus them” group dynamics shape officer interactions with the public. Yet, studies on racial disparities in policing overlook the interpersonal networks central to scholarship on group boundaries. We integrate insights from the literature on networks, group identity, and intergroup relations to consider how social network size and racial composition affect racial disparities in police officer use of force, and how those social network effects are conditioned by officer race. We test our perspective by analyzing newly collected longitudinal network data on the friendship relations between officers in one large department and linking these data to administrative records on officer use of force. The number of friendship ties to other officers is associated with within-officer increases in use of excessive force against Black victims, but not against White victims. Ties to White officers are only associated with use of excessive force against Black victims and only among Black officers. These findings suggest that social network integration contributes to racial disparities in police use of force and carries broader implications for intra- and intergroup discrimination in organizations characterized by strong institutional attachments.",

          "authors": "Caroline Martínez, Edward Telles, Florencia Torche",
          "abstract": "Indigenous peoples have long been classified based on cultural features. Reflecting changing nation-state projects and scholarly trends, Latin American censuses traditionally used Indigenous language proficiency to classify Indigenous populations. However, most Latin American censuses now prioritize the internationally sanctioned standard of self-identification. There is little understanding, though, of how language and physical traits are related to self-identification. Using America’s Barometer surveys for four countries with over two-thirds of the Indigenous population of the Americas (Bolivia, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru), we find that Indigenous language proficiency and darker skin color predict Indigenous identification. However, we also find that many Indigenous language speakers, particularly those with light skin color, do not identify as Indigenous, while some non-Indigenous language speakers, particularly those with dark skin color, identify as Indigenous. Our findings also suggest that national contexts dilute Indigenous identification through identity-eroding mestizaje projects but bolster it where there are strong Indigenous movements. Findings from this study highlight the interplay of physical and cultural traits, embedded in diverse nation-state contexts, in shaping Indigenous identification.",

          "authors": "Ethan Fosse, Fabian T. Pfeffer",
          "abstract": "Over the past decade there has been a striking increase in the number of quantitative studies examining the effects of social mobility, with almost all based on the diagonal reference model (DRM). We make four main contributions to this rapidly expanding literature. First, we show that under plausible values of mobility effects, the DRM will, in many cases, implicitly force the underlying mobility linear effect toward zero. In addition, we show both mathematically and through simulations that the mobility effects estimated by the DRM are sensitive to the size and sign of the origin and destination linear effects, often in ways that are unlikely to be intuitive to applied researchers. This finding clarifies why, contrary to expectations, applied researchers have generally found mixed evidence of mobility effects. Second, we generalize the identification problem of conventional mobility effect models by showing that the DRM and related methods can be viewed as special cases of a bounding analysis, where identification is achieved by invoking extremely strong assumptions. Finally, and importantly, we present a new framework for the analysis of mobility tables based on the identification and estimation of joint parameter sets, introducing what we call the structural and dynamic inequality model. We show that this model is fully identified, relies on much weaker assumptions than conventional models of mobility effects, and can be treated both as a descriptive model and, if additional assumptions are invoked, as a causal model. We conclude with an agenda for further research on the consequences of socioeconomic mobility.",

This article proposes an alternative flexible causal approach, where we estimate the cumulative hazard, not the hazard itself, using an additive or “exponential-additive” specification with freely time-varying parameters. Our approach includes the proportional hazard as a highly special case that allows only monotonic survival probability ratios (SPR’s), while our approach allows any shape of SPR’s. An empirical analysis on recidivism using the duration until re-arrest after prison release on parole/probation is provided, where the SPR trajectory is not monotonic, but has an inverted-U shape over time.",

Drawing on harmonized administrative data, the authors document a strong positive association: regions with larger motherhood penalties tend to exhibit wider gender earnings gaps. This pattern holds across all Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics second-division regions, where a 1 percent increase in the motherhood penalty corresponds to a 0.3 percent higher gender earnings gap. The relationship is even stronger within countries, with the average association rising to 0.7 percent. These findings suggest that regional differences in gender earnings inequality are strongly associated with the magnitude of motherhood penalties.",

          "abstract": "Since the 1980s, several studies have documented rising racial/ethnic diversity in neighborhoods in U.S. metropolitan areas, and others have reported a parallel decline in predominantly white neighborhoods and a rising number of multiethnic “global” neighborhoods. The authors examine three questions about these trends. First, do these trends represent a change in the pattern of segregation that has historically divided urban areas, or are they mainly a reflection of the overall changes in the urban population associated with the rapid growth in the number of Hispanic and Asian residents? Second, in what kinds of neighborhoods, classified by their racial/ethnic composition, is diversity rising? Third, how are trends in diversity associated with the various types of racial/ethnic transitions that have been reported in the literature on neighborhood change? The authors find that a large share of increases in diversity can be attributed to changes in overall metropolitan racial composition. As anticipated, however, diversity did typically increase in neighborhoods that developed a more inclusive composition, while those that lost their white presence became less diverse. On average, diversity was increasing in all types of neighborhoods irrespective of their initial racial composition, and similar changes were occurring in metropolitan areas with very different racial/ethnic composition.",

          "authors": "Nicolai T. Borgen, Are Skeie Hermansen, Astrid Marie Jorde Sandsør",
          "abstract": "Although there is an extensive literature on intergenerational mobility in education, including the completion of PhD degrees, far less is known about the transition into academic faculty positions. Here, the authors use administrative microdata following entire birth cohorts born from 1955 to 1985 in Norway, an egalitarian welfare state, to investigate the social origins of academic faculty. Despite publicly funded higher education and competitive wages for PhD positions, arguably removing many barriers to entry, the present findings reveal persistent disparities in the likelihood of becoming a faculty member. Differences in earlier stages of the educational career largely account for these disparities, indicating that disadvantaged family background does not appear to constitute an additional barrier to becoming a faculty member when comparing individuals with PhD degrees. However, more advantageous social origins influence the likelihood of employment at more prestigious institutions and higher earnings among faculty members, indicating that socioeconomic origins impact academic careers beyond their effects on entering academia. Overall, these findings show that within an egalitarian context designed to promote equality of opportunity, social origins continue to shape access and progression within academia.",

          "title": "Beyond Borders: Understanding Themes and Transitions in Skilled Migration Research Through Machine Learning Methods and Sociological Frameworks",
          "authors": "Yuyao Liu, Eric Fong",
          "abstract": "The global race to attract (highly) skilled or educated migrants (SEMs) has fueled significant scholarly interest, yet the evolution and collaboration patterns within SEM research remain underexplored. The authors address this gap by using computational methods (dynamic topic modeling, network analysis, and named entity recognition) to analyze 985 SEM-related studies published from 2000 to 2023 and to understand the temporal evolution of research themes. The findings reveal a rapid expansion of SEM research since 2010, with increasing scholarly engagement across diverse disciplines and countries, suggesting that intellectual proximity no longer dominates in this research field. Although key topics such as SEMs’ roles in international trade and integration challenges are gaining attention, most topics evolve slowly, revealing that the field is transitioning from a “reconfiguration” to a “normal” period, as theorized by Andrew Abbott. Research gaps persist, particularly in understanding SEMs’ social impacts and the role of nonpublic sectors in their migration and integration. This study provides a systematic analysis of SEMs’ research, identifying trends, gaps, and collaboration patterns. It demonstrates the value of combining machine learning methods with sociological theoretical frameworks in exploring migration studies, offering a methodological framework for other interdisciplinary domains.",

          "title": "Religion and Racial Bias in Artificial Intelligence Large Language Models",
          "authors": "Joshua C. Tom, Todd W. Ferguson, Brandon C. Martinez",
          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence large language models (LLMs) have been shown to replicate social and cultural biases that exist in their training data, particularly with regard to race and gender. The authors examine if LLMs hold implicit assumptions with regard to religious identities. The authors prompted multiple LLMs to generate a total of 175 religious sermons, specifying different combinations of race and religious tradition of the clergyperson. The synthetically generated sermons were fed into a readability analyzer and given several commonly used readability scores. The authors analyzed this dataset of readability scores using bivariate and multivariate analyses. LLMs generated sermon texts that varied in readability. Evangelical Protestant pastors had easier to read artificial intelligence–generated sermons, whereas Jewish rabbis and Muslim imams had more difficult to read synthetic texts. There were no significant differences in readability across ethnoracial groups; however, all prompts specifying a race/ethnicity generated more difficult to read synthetic text than those with no ethnoracial group specified. As LLMs continue to expand in accessibility and capability, it is important to continue to monitor the ways they may sustain social biases across a variety of identities and group memberships.",

          "abstract": "The length of acknolwegdements in scholarly books varies substantially by authors’ demographics. Women, people of color, and LGBQ scholars tend to write more about the people, resources, and conditions that made their books possible. So, too, do younger scholars and those who’s parents have graduate degrees. These differences may indicate both the increased size of the support networks these authors draw on, and/or a greater awareness of those networks’ value.",
