          "authors": "Leisy J. Abrego, Lucia León",
          "abstract": "US immigration policies have profound impacts on immigrant families. In a robust field of study across disciplines, scholars have documented how the multi-layered, complex immigration regime opens and closes doors to opportunity, health, education, safety, and peace. With a rise in harsh and unpredictable enforcement practices, immigrant families—including undocumented, liminally legal, and US citizen members—navigate the contradictory laws at the federal, state, and local levels to thrive as best as they can. In our review, we encourage scholars to extend their analysis to what happens during the migrant journey and at the border, as these experiences are also impacted by US immigration policies and potentially impact families long after they settle in the United States. The ever-changing labyrinthine legal landscape and its expansive reach provide fertile ground for further research, and we urge scholars to center ethics in their work with immigrant families made vulnerable through immigration laws.",

Researchers may find bewildering the options offered by the many commercial entities that provide research participants, and our review seeks to orient researchers to key issues about their use. We discuss principles and evidence regarding estimates from nonprobability samples versus those from probability samples. We also describe methods for addressing certain types of problem participants that one encounters in these samples: professional respondents, participants who are inattentive or have low linguistic competence, and bogus participants (increasingly in the form of bots). We urge researchers not to take data quality for granted, not to rely on indirect information to vouch for data quality, and to proactively build methods that allow for the evaluation of data quality into their instruments.",

          "abstract": "Survey experiments are an underutilized but powerful tool for sociologists interested in studying causal research questions. Survey experiments can yield insights into the breadth of causal relationships, by studying treatment effects in population samples or across subgroups, and can yield a deeper understanding of causal processes that are not readily observed with other social science methodologies. In this article, we begin by considering the conditions under which survey experiments are a uniquely useful method and highlight emblematic examples of recent sociological research. We then discuss some of the challenges and limitations of survey experiments as a research method before offering a brief practical guide to sociologists interested in conducting survey experiments. We conclude with reflections on the future of survey experimental research in sociology.",

          "abstract": "Because all human activity occurs at least partially in physical space, explaining sociological outcomes often benefits from modeling spatial patterns of social activity. This article reviews methods that sociologists may wish to use to analyze sociological phenomena based on three different types of data indexed to space in three ways: areal data indexed to polygons on the Earth's surface, point data indexed to latitudes and longitudes, and spatial ties data that measure relationships between people and place. Issues common to all three types of data, including privacy, changing between types of data, and model assumptions, deserve careful consideration, particularly to understand how those issues introduce systematic biases into analyses of spatially indexed data. The plethora of existing methods offer the chance to improve sociological explanations of spatial patterns of social life. The thoughtful collection of spatially indexed data and the construction of innovative variables that test ideas about how space influences social outcomes offer the best opportunity to improve sociological explanations for the influence of spatial processes in social life.",

          "abstract": "Social capital is among the most broadly used concepts in social science. Despite its shared understanding as beneficial resources available from the connections between people, authors vary widely in their conceptualizations of social capital. To extract clarity from these disparate perspectives, we offer a systematic framework for conceptualizing social capital, which identifies three primary theoretical dimensions of scholars’ conceptualizations of social capital: ( a ) where beneficial resources reside, ranging from within individuals to the relationships between individuals; ( b ) beneficial network structure, differentiating closure from brokerage arrangements; and ( c ) the level to which rewards accrue, distinguishing individual from collective benefits. We illustrate how combining these dimensions produces a unifying perspective that fosters reintegrating social capital's disconnected conceptualizations. Finally, we draw on this framework to both reconcile seeming contradictions and gaps in social capital scholarship, and provide a principled means for prioritizing questions for future developments of social capital.",

In addition to formal law and policy, the politics of healthcare include the larger cultural frameworks that politicize health and illness, rendering some bodies visible while ignoring or erasing others, and the institutions that offer or deny healthcare services. This article highlights both the definitional politics, that is, the contests of power that set the frames of healthcare, and also the politics of implementation and practice that powerfully shape healthcare institutions and experiences. In doing so, this article considers how politics structure the interactions within healthcare systems and around health and illness, and how those engaged in these care relationships must navigate power and politics within these broader organizational and cultural structures.",

          "authors": "Gracia Liu-Farrer",
          "abstract": "Skill-based selective migration policies are a dominant contemporary form of migration governance in labor receiving countries. Researchers have critiqued these policies, noting discrepancies between their intended goals and the actual labor market outcomes for immigrants. The social construction of skill offers a sociological interpretation of this migration phenomenon, emphasizing that skills and their categorization in international migration are intrinsically political. Skills are socially constructed by actors in specific local, national, transnational, and global contexts. This article reviews scholarship that explores these dynamics from Asian perspectives. It identifies the various positions that countries in Asia occupy in skill mobility and highlights the critical issues related to both outbound and inbound skill migration in this region, as well as intraregional mobilities. The concluding section cautions against a reproduction of skill hierarchy in social science research and advocates a social construction approach to analyzing skill mobilities in different world regions.",

          "authors": "Natasha Warikoo",
          "abstract": "Affirmative action began as a bipartisan policy to address racial inequality in the workplace and in higher education. Given its small footprint in college admissions (most colleges never practiced it), its bipartisan support in the early years, evidence documenting its positive impact, and renewed attention to racial inequality since 2020, why did it come to an end in 2023? This review traces the dominant cultural framings of affirmative action in college admissions and their changing usage in US political and legal systems over time, the relationship between framing and public support for affirmative action, and evidence for the central frames used to defend or critique the policy. I argue that understanding affirmative action's framing over time by political actors is key to understanding its demise. During the 1960s and 1970s, university leaders framed affirmative action as a mechanism to promote racial equity. From the late 1970s, advocates reframed the policy as a tool to promote the benefits of diversity. During that same period, critics advanced a reverse discrimination frame. As the reverse discrimination and diversity frames took hold in court, it became impossible for advocates to successfully excavate the earlier equity framing. As such, defenders were left with the diversity frame, a weak defense of a critical policy that eventually fell.",

These effects accumulate across the life course, reverberate across generations, and systematically undermine the social mobility of immigrants and their families, limiting their incorporation into mainstream institutions. While research on these associations is vast, knowledge gaps persist due to enduring methodological and data limitations, as well as an unauthorized population that is growing more diverse in its origins and its range of status protections. We review research on the impacts of immigrant legal status, describe persistent methodological obstacles, and explore new approaches and directions for advancing sociological research.",

          "authors": "Andrei Boutyline, Alina Arseniev-Koehler",
          "abstract": "Word embeddings are language models that represent words as positions in an abstract many-dimensional meaning space. Despite a growing range of applications demonstrating their utility for sociology, there is little conceptual clarity regarding what exactly embeddings measure and whether this matches what we need them to measure. Here, we fill this theoretical gap by clarifying how cultural meaning can be understood in spatial terms. We argue that embeddings operationalize context spaces, where words’ positions can reflect any regularity in usage. We then examine sociologists' embeddings-based measurements to argue that most sociologists are instead implicitly interested in capturing concept spaces, where positions strictly indicate meaningful conceptual features (e.g., femininity or status). Because meaningful features yield regularities in usage, context spaces can proxy for concept spaces. However, context spaces also reflect surface regularities in language—e.g., syntax, morphology, dialect, and phraseology—which are irrelevant to most sociological investigations and can bias cultural measurement. We draw on our framework to propose best practices for measuring meaning with embeddings.",

          "abstract": "Bereavement—the loss of a loved one through death—is a common and consequential life course experience. Although bereavement, and the topic of death and dying more broadly, has remained on the margins of sociology, sociological research on bereavement has flourished in the wake of contemporary mortality crises. This review synthesizes the new sociology of bereavement. To contextualize contemporary advancements, we first describe the earlier dominance of psychopathology perspectives. We then review recent sociological contributions, which recognize the structural systems that underpin bereavement and shape its wide-ranging and long-lasting consequences for individuals, families, and communities. We emphasize how bereavement experiences provide a microcosm for understanding social inequalities, and how a life course perspective can provide an integrative framework for a comprehensive sociology of bereavement. We conclude by identifying promising areas for future conceptual and methodological advancements in this emerging field.",

For each recommendation, we ( a ) delineate key theoretical principles tied to specific features of structural racism, ( b ) evaluate the strengths and limitations of existing measures and methods, and ( c ) propose best practices for measurement and modeling that align with theory and rigorous methodologies. Given the complex, multifaceted, and dynamic nature of structural racism, we emphasize the necessity of embracing epistemological and methodological pluralism. Scholars are encouraged to integrate insights through triangulation by leveraging diverse theoretical frameworks, varied data sources, and a wide array of methods. The review concludes by addressing pressing challenges and identifying opportunities for innovative research to deepen our understanding of structural racism and its enduring impacts in racialized societies.",

          "abstract": "Scholarship on finance has flourished in the aftermath of the Great Recession. While the sociology of finance typically centers developments since the financial turn of the 1970s, a burgeoning body of interdisciplinary scholarship sheds new light on the evolution of financial practices, institutions, and relations in earlier years. This review explores key contributions and themes from the new histories of finance, focusing on works published in the past decade that offer valuable insights for sociologists. We first review new contributions on ancient, medieval, and early modern finance, which illuminate the origins of money and credit, the development of financial thinking, and the relationship between finance and imperialism, colonialism, and slavery. Second, we survey new work on the development of modern financial markets in the long road to the financial turn of the 1970s. Together, these studies reveal how money, credit, and finance are embedded in political and legal institutions, and how financial systems act as tools of social policy, economic growth, war, and racial subjugation. Finally, long-run perspectives on finance provide an important reminder that borrowing, lending, and the management of attendant risks are not new phenomena unique to our neoliberal era.",

The sociology of public administration aims to understand how public administration perpetuates or mitigates inequalities through how well it performs (or does not) and for whom—balancing interest in performance and inclusivity. Sociological work on public administration has exploded in the past decade, illuminating the internal workings of the state apparatus and interrogating microlevel practices of governance, administration, and the chains by which policy comes to be enacted and experienced in the lives of citizens. This scholarship has concentrated around three themes: ( a ) public administration as a fragmented patchwork with high variation in performance, including administrative burdens that disproportionately affect marginalized groups; ( b ) public administration as a social arena with blurred boundaries, with unclear and negotiated jurisdictions for action, and where interpersonal and interorganizational connections have equivocal effects on the work of the state; and ( c ) understanding public administration as socially constituted, not only by rules on paper but by the people who do the work of the state, bringing identities, experiences, cognition, and cultural understandings to bear. The article also includes a supplemental appendix discussing public administration's role in institutionalizing categories that permeate everyday life, producing both legibility and illegibility.",

We discuss how the relationship between wealth and life outcomes is bidirectional, yet studies of racial wealth inequality overwhelmingly focus on wealth as an outcome. We suggest that studies that examine the relationship from wealth to life outcomes are necessary to enable full understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the production and reproduction of racial wealth inequality and to identify policies in the United States to reduce racial inequality. We highlight research on entrepreneurship, race, and wealth to illustrate these dynamics. We conclude with a call for scholars to focus on community-level wealth, given scholarly and policy interests in closing the racial wealth gap.",

          "authors": "Rina Agarwala, Poulami Roychowdhury",
          "abstract": "Why has India, the world's largest liberal democracy, joined the global turn toward authoritarianism? Drawing on the sociological literature on Indian politics, we argue that India's authoritarian turn emerges from the difficulty of sustaining democracy within an unequal society. The Indian state historically managed this difficulty by balancing the interests of opposed social groups: responding favorably to underprivileged groups’ demands for welfare and rights while simultaneously maintaining elite power and privilege. This approach ensured that everyone enjoyed some wins but also faced some disappointments. For decades, the Indian state's ability to sustain this juggling act was credited for the success of India's liberal democracy. Over time, however, the Indian state's attempt to appease opposed social groups became perilous for democracy. The more the state catered to elite and nonelite demands, the more empowered both groups became to express their dissatisfaction and demand more. Elites, resentful that their privilege was being chipped away to make room for nonelites, and nonelites, frustrated with continued poverty and marginalization at the hands of elites, both began seeking solutions from an alternative, authoritarian-style regime. Recent events suggest that one ray of hope for a more just future in India resides in the social movements that emerged from India's democracy and have recently tried to hold its increasingly authoritarian regime in check. By tracing the social basis of India's democratic fluctuations, sociological literature on India provides important insights for other unequal democracies, where similar elite resentments and nonelite frustrations are fueling authoritarianism.",

After a nontechnical outline of the integrated ST framework, I review three strands of sociological scholarship that have applied ST, broadly construed: ( a ) the job market and the education-to-work transition, ( b ) trust and cooperation in social and economic exchange relations, and ( c ) signaling norms and boundary making in intergroup relations.

We review research on these complexities, focusing on the US Census and immigration system as key state mechanisms that have shaped and obscured Latino racialization. Our goal is to review and outline dynamic features of Latino racialization, illustrating that such processes operate both in aggregate forms and in ways that reflect within-group variation, impacting Latinos who are not as frequently centered in the broader Latino category. We propose an expansive definition of racialization and introduce a conceptual model to address racial alignments (and misalignments) among its core elements: racial identification, racial ascription, and shared experiences of structural racism. The model accounts for multiple complex mechanisms by which racialization plays out and demonstrates that Latino racialization mirrors broader patterns in racial formation and is not so uniquely complex.",

This review outlines key demographic characteristics of the MENA American population and argues that by addressing the invisibility/hypervisibility paradox through innovative research questions and methods, previous scholarship has advanced sociology in three areas: identity, racialization, and integration. As upcoming changes to federal race and ethnicity standards take effect, the invisibility/hypervisibility paradox may shift as sociologists more easily collect and analyze data about MENA Americans. However, this information may be misused, misinterpreted, or handled unethically without sufficient background context and responsibility to community members. Future research will require data disaggregation to explore intersectional and intragroup minority issues, examination of the evolving content and meaning of MENA panethnicity, and ongoing assessment of the MENA group's relative racial position.",

However, gender is still overlooked and undertheorized in housing research. Drawing on gender scholars, we caution against the tendency to treat gender as a synonym for women, as a variable that compares outcomes to those of men, and/or as synonymous with binary roles (e.g., poor mothers of color versus affluent, White gentrifiers). We demonstrate how a subset of scholars departs from these tendencies and model avenues for further research, for example by viewing housing and gender as coconstitutive. Overall, we argue that the measurement of inequality at the city and neighborhood level stymies focus on gender. However, by taking housing units—and, crucially, the households that they contain—as their unit of analysis, sociologists of housing are well-positioned to merge attention to the importance of gender identities, expectations, and roles with analyses of multiple overlapping levels and sites of inequality.",

          "abstract": "An unprecedented recent wave of sport-based activism has brought renewed attention to sport as a force for racial progress and change. Researchers have investigated factors that facilitate protest, analyzed media coverage of and polarized reactions to such activism, and begun to document institutional and societal impacts. In contrast to long-standing sociological critiques, this work suggests that sport can make contributions to racial justice and change. However, these contributions necessitate deliberate contestation and are mainly symbolic and communicative; more concrete, institutional change requires other, nonsport movements and organizations. Also, athletic activism can be co-opted by the sport industry's complicity with profit and its fraught relationship with politics, and it often provokes backlash that can have unintended, countervailing effects. Ultimately, sport's multifaceted, mostly cultural contributions are best analyzed when situated in a broad sociopolitical field and theorized via a critical-dramaturgical framework where sport serves as a platform for the public display of social struggle.",

          "abstract": "Everyone agrees that US Black deaths happen earlier than white deaths on average, but it is surprisingly challenging to find the best ways to summarize, quantify, and compare this gap. This review argues that there are three main strategies for doing so, falling on a spectrum of more conventional (though with many novel variants) to unexpected. Distributional approaches quantify population death rates or lifespans, and there is a proliferation of new, creative distributional measures. Comparative approaches benchmark Black excess deaths against other deaths; some versions can be normatively powerful but rest on normative assumptions that are open to challenge. Meaning-based approaches attempt to measure losses—to decedents, their survivors, and the world—that follow from excess Black deaths. These losses range from lost votes and cultural production to traumatic proximity to death to lost chances for reconciliation. Each approach offers new empirical and theoretical opportunities to better understand unequal lifespans.",

In this study, we theorize the role of nonstate actors in political repression in a relatively more democratic setting, that of Israel. We conducted a systematic content analysis of thousands of legal documents, parliamentary archives, and media reports, complementing these with ethnographic work in several NGOs and in-depth interviews with NGO staffers. In contrast with theoretical views that see legislative processes as merely window dressing, we found that the Israeli legislative process has had a profound impact on Israeli HR NGOs, entailing a significant loss of public and political support, legitimacy, and scarce resources. We argue that scholars of political repression must pay greater attention to the crucial role played by nonstate actors in advancing and enforcing repressive legislation and to the entire legislative process—rather than only its formal legal results.",

          "authors": "Daniel Tadmon",
          "abstract": "In the United States, most mental health services are provided by independent helping professionals, individually deciding where to operate, whom to treat, and in which insurance networks to participate. In making such decisions, these market actors often navigate conflicts between financial, professional, and prosocial considerations. This article investigates the phenomenon of psychiatrist opt-out from Medicaid and Medicare, aiming to elucidate how social contexts influence such decisions. Assembling a census of all licensed Georgia psychiatrists and, assisted by a telephone audit, leveraging granular data about the environments in which clinicians operate, findings show that limits to helping in the form of opt-out from public insurance systematically correspond to the social ecologies in which psychiatrists are embedded—with their prospective clientele and local peers. Evidence of alignment between insurance participation and population needs, when financially justified, and of spatially dependent monopolistic and competition-curbing behavior point at the power of these ecologies in shaping the balance actors negotiate between local economic and normative pressures. Theoretically, findings support the argument that meso-level conditions mediate countervailing social forces and their translation to action—here, spatially configuring how markets and morals interact. In the context of the mental health crisis, where demand for care far exceeds supply, understanding how spatial conditions ultimately shape the pressures that helping professionals face and their opt-out decisions is crucial. In aggregate, these individually decided yet ecologically conditioned limits to helping impact the availability of mental health services to some of society’s most disadvantaged populations, thus shaping the contours of the crisis.",

          "authors": "Laura Tach, Emily Parker, Alexandra Cooperstock, Samuel Dodini",
          "abstract": "This paper assesses the growth and spatial distribution of federal place-based policies in the United States. Using a novel dataset of federal place-based policies from 1990 to 2019, we show how the dual forces of fiscalization and financialization have fueled a substantial increase in federal place-based funding to communities via competitive tax credit and grant programs. We consider whether federal place-based funding has been distributed in a compensatory way by prioritizing more disadvantaged communities or whether it has compounded neighborhood inequalities by prioritizing more advantaged communities. We find that federal place-based funding has gone overwhelmingly to communities experiencing economic disadvantage, as intended, but at the same time such policies have compounded other forms of spatial inequality via disproportionate investment in areas with more nonprofit organizations and stronger housing markets. Economically disadvantaged neighborhoods that are spatially embedded within counties with strong housing markets and robust nonprofit sectors received the most federal place-based funding. These organizational and housing market inequities are strongest for tax credit and competitive grant programs, precisely the forms of funding that have grown most over this period. The funding trends reveal a pattern of cumulative advantage, as poor communities with initial funding advantages in the 1990s went on to receive the vast majority of federal place-based funding in the subsequent decades, leading to growing divergence among high-poverty communities in the distribution of federal place-based resources over time.",

          "abstract": "The racial segregation of schools and neighborhoods are mutually reinforcing because school districts assign students to schools based on residential address and parents account for this link when deciding where to live. Parents cite a desire for the “package deal” of a good neighborhood with a good local school. Yet, in studying how race shapes parents’ preferences, scholars typically examine these contexts in isolation. Using an original stated choice experiment, I propose and test two theoretical frameworks for how the package deal influences parents’ joint preferences for schools and neighborhoods. I find that school and neighborhood preferences are interactive, meaning that neighborhood characteristics shape the effects of school characteristics on parents’ decisions and school characteristics shape the effects of neighborhood characteristics, and the nature of this interaction varies by parent race. I find that White parents’ preferences for Whiter schools and neighborhoods are magnified across contexts, such that White parents prefer racial isolation in both their schools and neighborhoods. Latino parents also prefer greater Latino representation in both neighborhoods and schools, but these preferences are only activated in majority Latino contexts. In contrast, Black parents prefer to avoid being a racial minority in both schools and neighborhoods but are satisfied when just one context is majority Black. These intertwined, interactive preferences mean that our understanding of how parents decide where to live and where to send their children to school must account for the relationship between these contexts.",

          "authors": "Pablo A. Mitnik",
          "abstract": "Although there is an extensive methodological literature on the measurement of intergenerational income mobility, there has been limited research on the conceptual interpretation of mobility measures and the methodological implications of those interpretations. In this article, I focus on the three measures of mobility most frequently used in the literature—the intergenerational elasticity (IGE), the intergenerational correlation (IGC), and the rank-rank slope (RRS)—as well as a recently introduced measure, the intergenerational elasticity of expected income (IGEE). I make two main contributions, both related to the conceptual interpretation of mobility measures. First, I specify the formal relationships between those four mobility measures and the measures of inequality of opportunity developed in the luck egalitarian empirical literature on the topic, and determine the methodological implications of the analyses. I show that (a) the IGC is a measure of relative inequality of opportunity for monetary income, (b) the RRS is both a measure of relative inequality of opportunity for income rank and a rescaled measure of absolute inequality of opportunity for income rank, and (c) the products of parental income inequality by the IGEE and IGE are both measures of absolute inequality of opportunity for monetary income that differ in how they measure the value of opportunity sets. Second, relying on a conceptual distinction that has been influential in the field of public finance, the IGE and IGEE have been characterized as “person-weighted” and “dollar-weighted” elasticities, respectively, thus raising doubts about the desirability of a recent proposal to replace the IGE by the IGEE as the workhorse elasticity of the mobility field. I show that this contrasting characterization of the two intergenerational elasticities is the joint result of a category mistake—equating quantile-specific elasticities to person-specific elasticities—and of misconstruing the nature of the IGE and the epistemic goal it has been meant to serve. Based on this analysis, I conclude that the case for replacing the IGE with the IGEE remains well-founded.",

We reveal the subjective value-judgments in them: they are represented by weighted-sums (or aggregators) over heterogeneous groups, with controversial economic properties. Log-level regressions tend to overrepresent the experiences of middle-class children while underrepresenting those from disadvantaged families. We propose a general construction of IGM measures that can incorporate any transparent economic preferences. They are interpreted as the marginal effect of parental normalized social welfare on children’s normalized welfare. Conventional regressions are special cases with implicit economic preferences that fail inequality-aversion and the Pigou–Dalton principle of transfers. Empirically, a variety of economic preferences, with varying inequality aversion, demonstrate a nuanced view of mobility, and perspectives on geographic-differences and dynamics of it.",

Second, we compare the proportion of flagged respondents for two versions of an attention check item instructing them to select a specific response versus leaving the item blank. Third, we propose a timestamp-based cluster analysis approach that identifies clusters of respondents who exhibit different speeding behaviors. Our findings show that the commitment pledge had no effect on the data quality measures. Instructing respondents to leave the item blank significantly increased the rate of flagged respondents (by 16.8 percentage points). The timestamp-based clustering approach efficiently identified clusters of likely inattentive respondents. Lastly, we show that inattentive respondents can have substantial impacts on substantive analyses.",

          "abstract": "What entities deserve moral rights? Although this question has been of long-standing interest to ethics and social theory, it has resurfaced in a particularly pronounced way with artificial intelligence (AI). Using original survey data from a convenience sample and a large-scale random sample of Switzerland, we compare two explanations for the willingness to grant moral rights to AI. The ontological view refers to perceived human-like properties of AI, such as sentience (i.e., what AI is). The social impact view refers to the social-relational meaning of AI in terms of its impact on humans and trust (i.e., what AI does). The findings corroborate both views. Support for the general idea of AI rights and a political referendum granting basic rights to AI are positively correlated with the perceived ontological proximity of AI to humans, expected benefits of AI for society, and trust in AI developers. A right to life and physical integrity rests on perceived ontological properties only. Ontological distance of AI to simple computer programs, expected costs of AI, and trust in the state play a minor or no role. Sociological perspectives on an entity’s social-relational meaning are hence indispensable to explain the social construction of moral rights for AI.",

          "abstract": "With the growing acceptance of diverse sexual orientations, displaying rainbow flags has become a widespread urban practice, symbolizing solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community. What motivates individuals to publicly express support for the rights of sexual minorities beyond private approval? The authors explore whether social exposure among flat neighbors contributes to the public display of rainbow flags on private windows and balconies by conducting an extensive field observation of 135,202 residents in the city of Bern, Switzerland. The authors applied models to compare the spatial clustering of flagged households with a simulated distribution representing independent actors at façades, a granular approach to address residential self-selection. The analysis reveals that flagged households are significantly closer to one another on façades than expected under random conditions, indicating social influence among close flat neighbors. The authors also observed an excess of buildings either completely devoid of flags or displaying a large number of them, suggesting that committed minorities can induce a self-reinforcing cycle whereby each nearby flag lowers perceived risks for nonadopters, increasing the likelihood of further displays. These results suggest that the public expression of LGBTQ+ support not only stems from individual beliefs but also can emerge through social exposure to neighboring supporters.",

The authors use repeated cross-sectional income data from the Luxembourg Income Study database (1999–2019) ( n = 26 countries, 280 country-years, 2.9 million employees) combined with an original collection of indicators on work-family policies, labor market conditions, and gender norms. The authors find that only one work-family policy, long paid parental leave (longer than six months), is associated with a larger gender earnings gap for mothers and tertiary-educated women. The negative relationship between long paid leave and women’s earning percentile is not well explained by selection, full-time status, work hours, experience, occupation, or sector, suggesting discrimination mechanisms. These findings add to the growing evidence that long paid leave specifically, as opposed to work-family policies more generally, cleaves the labor market outcomes of women from men.",
