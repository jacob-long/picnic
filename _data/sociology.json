          "title": "Pre-emptive Repair of Potential Misunderstandings: Prospective Procedures for Managing Intersubjectivity and Steering Social Action",
          "authors": "Chase Wesley Raymond, Virginia Teas Gill",
          "abstract": "In social interaction, participants face a pervasive problem: recipients might not only misinterpret what speakers are saying and doing, but they might act on those misinterpretations. A practical challenge for speakers is thus how to prevent misunderstandings that may lead to inapposite conduct. In this study, we bring prior interactional research together with new data from a range of social settings, to focus on the pre-emptive repair of potential misunderstandings as a resource in interaction. This type of repair can be distinguished from speakers’ self-corrections of their own speaking difficulties, as well as from speakers’ repairs of misunderstandings that recipients have already displayed. When speakers engage in pre-emptive repair—expanding their turns in prospective positions to address how they should not and/or should be understood—they orient to interpretive troubles that might relevantly emerge and the potential for these troubles to affect future action. By heading off potential misunderstandings before they can manifest in recipient behavior, speakers work anticipatorily to “steer” recipients toward more apposite conduct. The analysis offers empirical insight into how members of society use context-specific sensemaking practices and concrete conversational resources to shape interpretive landscapes in the service of intersubjectivity and social action.",

          "title": "Competence over Partisanship: Party Affiliation Does Not Affect the Selection of School District Superintendents",
          "authors": "Greer Mellon",
          "abstract": "In recent decades, affective polarization and partisan animosity have risen sharply in the United States. To what extent have these trends affected hiring decisions? I examine partisan biases in hiring by considering the case of school district superintendent appointments: chief executives of local U.S. elementary/secondary education systems. I analyze mixed-methods data on a decade of hiring outcomes in Florida and California from 2009 to 2019. Despite rising polarization, the data consistently show that partisan affiliation is not a primary factor in these hiring decisions. Quantitative analyses reveal no significant relationship between changes in board partisan composition and superintendent hiring outcomes within school districts. I find no relationship between board-level partisan composition and superintendent exits. Qualitative findings show hiring decisions are primarily shaped by evaluations of candidates’ interpersonal skills and competence, even among board members with strong partisan views on other policy issues. Board members discuss a strong commitment to building consensus in their selections. While I cannot rule out very small effects, these results show that school boards do not routinely prioritize applicants from their own political party. This study advances research on affective polarization and social closure by demonstrating the contingent nature of partisan affiliation on decision-making and by providing evidence of a strong respect for professionalism in a critical U.S. public sector setting.",

          "title": "Offering safe passage: grading systems and gendered enrollment patterns in undergraduate mathematics",
          "authors": "Monique H Harrison",
          "abstract": "While copious research documents that early grades in college are fateful for persistence in STEM fields, social scientists have seldom considered how grading systems themselves might influence STEM progress. Drawing on university-wide transcript data and longitudinal interview data from a cohort of undergraduates moving through an elite university, I show that a university-wide transition from A–F to pass/fail grades during the COVID-19 pandemic substantially influenced student decisions to enroll in mathematics courses. Female-identified students from minoritized ethno-racial groups were substantially more likely to enroll in their first math courses than demographically similar students in prior years. Interviews reveal that pass/fail grades gave these students a sense of safety with a subject they perceived as difficult. Integrating these findings with insights from the sociology of quantification, I theorize that grading systems—the specific scales used to assign final course grades (e.g., A–F grading or pass/fail)—may have independent effects on demographic segmentation and stratification in undergraduate education.",

          "title": "Information foundations of state capacity: evidence from the imperial bureaucracy of China",
          "authors": "Xiaoming Zhang",
          "abstract": "Building a strong state requires ample information regarding civil societies; otherwise, central authorities lack the foundation to implement taxation schemes and mobilize the military. However, the information foundations of state capacity are under-researched by scholars. This paper studies a communication reform in the imperial bureaucracy of Qing China, which allowed certain local officials to report directly to the emperor, serving as informants. Leveraging the fact that the direct communication channel was unevenly introduced, this paper finds that government disaster assistance, a critical public good in pre-industrial societies, was significantly increased in prefectures where at least one informant was assigned, compared to those without informants. Furthermore, the increase in government assistance can be mainly attributed to improved information transmission and competitive information supply facilitated by direct communication within the bureaucracy. This research highlights the positive impact of a flattening and competitive information structure on the development of state capacity.",

          "title": "Competing Models of Disability: Medicalization’s Ambivalent Effects on the Paralympic Movement",
          "authors": "Evan T. Baughman",
          "abstract": "Disability is predominantly understood as a medical problem. Since the 1980s, disability scholars have critiqued the medicalization of disability to illuminate disability’s social and political dimensions. Building on this tradition, the present article analyzes the Paralympic movement to call sociological attention to how medicalization affects disabled social movements, cultural production, and cultural practices. The author draws from interviews with Paralympic athletes and coaches alongside primary historical sources to identify and evaluate medicalization’s effects on the Paralympic movement. Findings show that medicalization both enabled and constrained the Paralympic movement. The medicalization of spinal cord injuries developed lifesaving treatments and mobilized disability sport as rehabilitative treatment to mold patients into healthy, productive “taxpayers.” Framing disability sport as rehabilitation catalyzed the medicalization of the Paralympic movement, as the medical profession facilitated the formation and maintenance of the movement. This understanding of disability sport reflected the clinical nature of medicine and rehabilitation’s approach to disability. However, the clinical approach to Paralympic sport conflicted with Paralympians’ desire for high-performance disability sport and recognition as elite athletes. Medical governance subsequently marginalized Paralympians within Paralympic organizations and limited Paralympians’ ability to develop their sports beyond mere rehabilitation. These findings are consistent with Mauldin’s conceptualization of medicalization as “ambivalent.”",

          "authors": "Ka U Ng",
          "abstract": "Differences in family values between Muslims and non-Muslims have been widely debated in Europe, but gender differences within Muslims remain less explored. Using survey data from immigrants and children of immigrants in France, this study investigated the gender differences in ideal family size among Muslims and non-Muslims. Poisson regression models show that male Muslim children of immigrants tend to prefer larger families, like their foreign-born parents, and that their female counterparts, like non-Muslim men and women, prefer smaller families. Decomposition analysis shows that differences in education and friendship networks explain only a small part of this gender gap. Notably, religiosity does not explain the gap. Instead, the stronger influence of in-group friendship networks and residential segregation on men’s fertility ideals accounts for most of the observed difference. These findings contribute a gender perspective to acculturation research on family values.",
