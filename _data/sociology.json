          "title": "“Choppy Waters”: Navigating Political Generational Conflict in Social Movement Organizations",
          "authors": "Carolina P. Seigler, Kristopher Velasco, Pamela Paxton",
          "abstract": "Social movements are composed of distinct political generations. Yet empirical work documenting distinct generations is limited, and work detailing the conflict and problems created by generational turnover exceedingly rare. Based on interviews with 39 leaders of LGBTQ+ organizations, supplemented with longitudinal administrative text data from 1,840 LGBTQ+ organizational mission statements, we demonstrate political generational change, and conflict, in the U.S. LGBTQ+ movement. The prior “Legacy” generation is confronted by an “Emergent” generation with different understandings of sexuality/gender, intersectionality, and organizational strategies. These conflictual differences produce material and emotional consequences as the “Legacy” generation takes their resources away and members of both generations feel erased from the movement’s collective identity. Leaders navigate these “choppy waters” by taking either a harsh approach, which seeks to dismiss whichever generation is viewed as hindering their organization’s work, or an inclusive approach that views generational tension as an opportunity to grow and strengthen their organization and the larger movement. We highlight how the observed conflict between political generations prompts a serious re-evaluation of the “unity through diversity” mantra associated with this movement. Ultimately, political generations are a critical link to understanding transformation and change in social movements with clear implications for collective identity, resource mobilization, and other core social movement processes.",

          "title": "Shades of Égalité : Educational Mobility and Ethnoracial Hierarchy Over Three Generations in France",
          "authors": "Mathieu Ferry, Milan Bouchet-Valat, Lucas G. Drouhot, Mathieu Ichou, Ognjen Obućina",
          "abstract": "The long-term incorporation of immigrant-origin populations is a crucial question in liberal democracies. While much research has focused on the second generation, less is known about the grandchildren of immigrants. Investigating this “third generation” is key to assessing whether migration societies offer equal opportunity to their members regardless of their origins—that is, whether family background shapes life chances in a similar way among immigrant and native families. Here, we gauge the influence of ethnoracial origins on life chances in the long run by studying trajectories of intergenerational educational mobility among immigrant and native families over three generations. Our study is set in France, a major country of immigration in Europe, where a national narrative of immigrant integration and equality across ethnic origins has long prevailed. We show substantial catching up in educational attainment and higher social fluidity in immigrant families, for whom the grandparental educational starting point was very low. The grandchildren of Southern European immigrants converge with natives in their mobility patterns, suggesting equal opportunities. Despite a partial convergence, the grandchildren of North African immigrants experience a distinct mobility regime and enduring educational disadvantage. Altogether, our results suggest the existence of an ethnoracial hierarchy, whereby Southern European families experience educational destinies broadly comparable to those of natives, while ethnoracial origins durably shape the educational trajectories of North African families.",

          "title": "Organizational Scarring, Legal Consciousness, and the Diffusion of Local Government Litigation Against Opioid Manufacturers",
          "authors": "Amanda Sharkey, Kathryne M. Young, Christof Brandtner, Patrick Bergemann",
          "abstract": "Between 2017 and 2020, local government attorneys’ offices in the United States filed a surge of lawsuits against opioid manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. Aimed at recovering the costs of the opioid epidemic, this “affirmative litigation” was a novel action for most of them. Participation necessitated a tectonic shift in how they conceptualized their roles vis-à-vis the law. To understand how this occurred, we use a mixed-methods approach that draws on in-depth interviews and event-history analysis. Our investigation reveals the importance of “organizational scarring,” wherein an organization develops a lingering sense of having been wronged by another entity—a feeling that persists via an organizational narrative but does not shape organizational action until much later. Here, scarring resulted from the Big Tobacco lawsuits. As many localities perceived it, states’ distribution of settlement money unfairly disadvantaged them. This scar was activated when the possibility of opioid litigation arose, triggering distrust of state legal action and causing local government attorneys to reconceptualize affirmative litigation as befitting their roles—which facilitated their decisions to sue. Our findings not only shed light on a tactic that local governments are increasingly using to respond to public health crises, but also inform research on organizational learning, diffusion, and legal consciousness.",

          "title": "Managing motherhood: how “queen bee” managers in the US service sector reduce motherhood advantages in work scheduling",
          "authors": "Joshua Choper",
          "abstract": "This study advances sociological theories of motherhood-based workplace inequalities by examining how frontline managers shape mothers’ access to stable work schedules in the US service sector. Prior research has shown that mothers in the US service sector experience intense conflict between the time demands of motherhood and employers’ expectations that employees will be available to work unstable work schedules, yet little work has investigated sources of variation in mothers’ exposure to schedule instability. Building on and synthesizing theories of homophily, expectation states theory, and “queen bee” theories of women in management, I propose a model in which managers’ own gender and parenthood status structure their responses to their employees’ scheduling needs. Female managers who are mothers are theorized to exhibit homophily and produce motherhood scheduling advantages, while female managers without children are expected to penalize mothers. Analyses of survey and experimental data collected from a large national sample of US retail and food service workers support this theoretical synthesis, showing that motherhood advantages in scheduling appear under male managers and female managers who are mothers, but erode under female managers without children. By positioning motherhood—not gender alone—as the status dimension that most directly collides with ideal worker norms, this work highlights an important determinant of when women in management act as agents of change and when they reinforce inequality. More broadly, this study frames managerial discretion as a key mechanism linking status expectations, manager-employee relations, and organizational outcomes, advancing theory on the micro-foundations of workplace inequality.",

          "title": "Economic inequality and economic segregation: a systematic review of causal pathways",
          "authors": "Clémentine Cottineau-Mugadza",
          "abstract": "Although economic inequality and economic segregation represent fundamental challenges of contemporary societies, their causal and empirical connections remain unclear. In particular, the direction of causality, causal pathways, and temporalities are not evident in the literature. This gap has two probable origins: (1) the discussion is dominated by a handful of studies from the United Stated published in the 2000s. This comes at the expense of a more plural and complex understanding of the phenomena in the rest of the world. (2) The literature on inequality and that of segregation are segmented by disciplines operating at different scales with corresponding theories, actors and mechanisms. To address these issues, I conduct an extensive systematic literature review of articles linking economic inequality to economic segregation across multiple languages and disciplines. Starting from 20,000+ references, I identify 80 relevant research articles to review. Most conclude that variations in economic segregation follow differences in economic inequality in the short term and that reverse causality is more probable in the longer term. The housing market is the most cited mediator between economic inequality and economic segregation, and a diversity of theories are mobilized to explain their empirical connections. Many articles are not presently comparable, but compatible definitions and measurements of inequality and segregation are rising.",

          "authors": "Jieun Song",
          "abstract": "The notion that everyone deserves education and that governments need to strive for this ideal has been legitimized and expanded worldwide over the past few decades, as a central part of the successful establishment of a liberal world order. However, the recent resurgence of global illiberalism poses a threat to liberal ideas of equity and diversity, potentially impeding progress toward a more inclusive education system. Against this backdrop, I investigate the extent to which countries around the world introduced policies to incorporate historically disadvantaged populations into education between 1960 and 2019 and what sociocultural factors are associated with the adoption of education policies for the marginalized. Using event count analyses and a novel longitudinal dataset on global education reforms, I show that countries are more likely to adopt education policies for the marginalized when liberalism is globally prevalent, while they are less likely to do so when illiberalism is globally prominent. I also find that countries’ linkages to international liberal or illiberal institutions, including through organized transnational networks, as well as domestic sociopolitical environments, relate to the adoption of education policies for the marginalized. These results help illuminate how countries exist in a world filled with opposing cultural models and through which mechanisms their approaches to educational equity are shaped by such global forces. While focused on education for the marginalized, these findings offer insights into understanding inequality in a changing world context of growing illiberalism.",

          "authors": "Murat Haner, Melissa M Sloan, Justin T Pickett, Francis T Cullen",
          "abstract": "As domestic terrorism has become central to US national security, the American public has shown divided reactions to political violence. In the current context of increasing political polarization and racial tension, we draw on social identity theory to compare responses to Islamist, left-wing, and right-wing terrorism and identify moderators of those responses. Analyses of data from a 2022 national survey experiment (n = 1,300) reveal that Americans’ responses to terrorism depend heavily on who is doing the terrorizing. Whereas Americans are equally outraged by Islamist, right-wing, and left-wing terrorism, support for controversial policies varies by terrorist type, with greater support for the use of torture on Islamist terrorists. Our findings also point toward the importance of Republicanism and white nationalist sentiment. Compared to Democrats, Republicans were more supportive of policy and the use of torture targeting Islamist terrorists and less supportive of policy targeting right-wing extremists. In addition, white nationalist sentiment corresponded to increased support for aggressive counterterrorism policy and the use of torture when applied to left-wing and Islamist terrorists. As public opinion is key to the development of government policies, it is critical that policymakers recognize the role of outgroup animosity in public support of counterterrorism measures.",

          "abstract": "How significant are behavioral causes of death—suicide, homicide, accidental poisoning, and traffic accidents—in determining how long Americans live? By “determining,” the authors mean limiting or reducing, as they are looking at factors (causes of death) that reduce an individual’s length of life. This data visualization portrays the extent to which deaths from homicide, suicide, traffic accidents, and accidental poisoning disproportionately affect longevity (average lifespan) in the United States. The impact on longevity is about three times greater, on average, for deaths from behavioral causes than for deaths from cancer or heart disease. The outsized impact of behavioral causes of death underscores their strategic importance for improving longevity in the United States.",

          "authors": "Haoming Song",
          "abstract": "This study revisits the question of “who marries whom” by examining detailed patterns of racial and educational assortative mating across newlywed different-sex and same-sex couples in the United States. Against the backdrop of growing racial diversity, driven largely by recent immigration from Latin America and Asia, and the expansion of higher education, including graduate degrees, the author asks what boundaries are being crossed and for whom. Using nationally representative couple-level data from the 2013 to 2023 American Community Survey, the author found that same-sex newlyweds, particularly male couples, were more likely to be interracial and educationally heterogamous than different-sex couples, with educational crossing more prevalent. Detailed pairing further reveals that White-Hispanic and, to a lesser extent, White-Asian unions primarily accounted for higher interraciality among same-sex male couples. Among same-sex couples, educational heterogamy often involved pairings among those with at least some college experience, such as bachelor’s and graduate degree pairs. These findings underscore how structural demographic shifts are reshaping new marital sorting and call for moving beyond binary measures of homogamy to capture how much, which, and for whom boundaries are crossed in the ongoing study of “who marries whom.”",

          "authors": "Cora Fernández Anderson, Anna Calasanti, Tamara Kay",
          "abstract": "Because research focuses on unidirectional diffusion, primarily from the Global North to the Global South, diffusion in more than one direction has not been examined. Here the authors ask: How does the diffusion of social movement symbols and strategies occur from North to South and from South to North? To answer this question, the authors examine a case of diffusion between abortion rights movements. Using data from in-depth interviews with activists in the United States, Argentina, and Mexico, the authors argue that symbols and strategies originating in the United States prior to Roe v. Wade spread to Argentina and Mexico during the last decades of intense struggle for abortion rights, while strategies and symbols from Argentina and Mexico created during this time diffused to the United States in the months leading up to the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health decision. This study introduces and develops the novel concept of circular diffusion : the process by which innovations move from originator to adopter—where they are adopted whole cloth, transformed, or used as inspiration for new innovations depending on local contexts—and then back to the originator. During this process, originators and adopters exchange roles as they learn from each other over time. In the case of movements for abortion rights, the authors argue that both ongoing contestation and ongoing interactions are necessary to activate and sustain the process of circular diffusion.",
