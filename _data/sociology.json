          "title": "When We Target Federal Workers, Whom Are We Targeting? Three Perspectives on U.S. Federal Workers",
          "authors": "Deirdre Bloome",
          "abstract": "The U.S. Department of Government Efficiency has targeted U.S. federal workers through downsizings, funding reductions, and delegitimization efforts. When we target federal workers, whom are we targeting? The author offers a three-dimensional description of civilian federal workers, highlighting commonalities , inequalities , and majority composition . Data come from the Current Population Survey, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Federal workers are prevalent across metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas in red states, blue states, and swing states. About 1 in every 28 children in 2024 lived with a federal worker, potentially targeted by the Department of Government Efficiency in 2025. In veterans’ households, that number was about 1 in 9 children. Federal workers are prevalent across all ethnoracial groups. Most federal workers are White, and most downsized federal workers are likely to be White. But Black, Native American, and multiracial people are overrepresented among federal workers, and Native American federal workers may be even further overrepresented among the downsized. So whom are we targeting? People who resemble most Americans, people supporting millions of children across the country, and, disproportionately, veterans and members of several marginalized ethnoracial groups. Moving forward, this type of three-dimensional description can be applied to understand populations beyond federal workers.",

          "title": "Racial Primacy in the Eye of the Beholder: White Respondents’ Normative Judgments of Mixed- and Same-Race Couples",
          "authors": "Safa Salim",
          "abstract": "Existing research shows that some interracial relationship configurations, such as White and East Asian, particularly White men with East Asian women, are far more common than others, such as Black and East Asian. This raises the question: how do Americans evaluate different types of same- and mixed-race couples? After all, third-party evaluations shape which unions are socially encouraged or discouraged and reveal broader norms about intergroup boundaries and relationship legitimacy. The author examines how White Americans evaluate various same- and mixed-race pairings, such as White and Black versus White and East Asian couples, and White men with Black women versus White women with Black men. Using a novel dyadic conjoint experiment, a national sample of White respondents evaluated fictional dating app couples, making it possible to causally identify how race and gender shape third-party perceptions. The results show a consistent preference for same-race couples: respondents rated them more favorably, believed others would do so too, and saw them as more compatible and enduring. Contrary to theories of racialized sexuality, partner gender played a limited role in evaluations of interracial couples. The key exception was among White men, who disapproved more of mixed-race couples involving White women. These findings advance research on racial homophily, racialized sexuality, and third-party perceptions, revealing how racial boundaries shape imagined futures and relationship legitimacy.",
