          "authors": "Jennifer A. Reich",
          "abstract": "This review article examines how politics shape healthcare. In addition to formal law and policy, the politics of healthcare include the larger cultural frameworks that politicize health and illness, rendering some bodies visible while ignoring or erasing others, and the institutions that offer or deny healthcare services. This article highlights both the definitional politics, that is, the contests of power that set the frames of healthcare, and also the politics of implementation and practice that powerfully shape healthcare institutions and experiences. In doing so, this article considers how politics structure the interactions within healthcare systems and around health and illness, and how those engaged in these care relationships must navigate power and politics within these broader organizational and cultural structures.",

          "authors": "Tania M Jenkins, Alyssa R Browne",
          "abstract": "As more women enter traditionally male-dominated professions, it is important to understand how feminization has—or has not—impacted work cultures, with implications for women’s mental wellbeing. Research on proportional representation and mental health suggests that as professions feminize, women’s mental wellbeing should benefit from shifting peer cultures. However, gender stratification scholars argue that interactional cultures are also shaped by macrolevel factors like institutional rules and hegemonic beliefs that may temper cultural change. We examine the case of medicine, a profession that has feminized rapidly but unevenly over recent decades, to investigate the extent to which increasing representation of women shapes not only local peer cultures, but also the professional logics and rules that frame those local cultures, in ways that may affect women’s mental wellbeing. Drawing on interviews with physicians and trainees in more- and less-feminizing specialties, we find that masculinized norms persist across fields, regardless of feminization, because these ideals are codified through enduring professional rules and logics. These ideals can negatively shape women’s mental wellbeing, as they either disengage from their work or grow frustrated with sexist expectations—especially those in more feminized specialties who expected a more “women-friendly” experience. Our findings suggest that increasing proportional representation may be necessary but insufficient for prompting profession-wide cultural change and improving women’s mental wellbeing, given the complexity of the gender structure.",

          "authors": "Diego F. Leal",
          "abstract": "Although the literature on cultural holes has expanded considerably in recent years, there is no concrete measure in that literature to locate cultural holes brokers. This article develops a conceptual framework grounded in social network theory and cultural sociology to propose a specific solution to fill this measurement gap. Agent-based computational experiments are leveraged to develop a theoretical test of the analytic purchase and distinctiveness of the proposed measure, termed potential for intercultural brokerage (PIB). Results demonstrate the effectiveness of PIB in locating early adopters that can achieve widespread levels of diffusion in societies segregated along bright symbolic boundaries. Findings also show the superiority of PIB when compared to classic alternative measures in the network literature that focus on locating early adopters based on structural holes (e.g., network constraint, effective size), geodesics (e.g., betweenness centrality), and degree (e.g., degree centrality), among other classic network measures. Broader implications of these findings for brokerage theory are discussed herein.",

          "title": "Gendered Pathways to the Job Offer: Stereotypes and Diversity Value during Job Offer Decisions in Software Engineering Hiring",
          "authors": "Koji Chavez",
          "abstract": "Many corporations in the United States are under pressure to increase gender diversity in professions such as software engineering that have long been dominated by men. Current sociological theory suggests that in response to such pressure, hiring decision makers value women job candidates as potential contributions to gender diversity and incorporate this value into their initial hiring screening decisions. However, it remains unclear whether and how decision makers take diversity into consideration in later hiring stages, namely, during offer decisions, and particularly when there is a strong culture of meritocracy. In this article, the author examines a critical case study of software engineering hiring at a midsized high-technology firm. Drawing on qualitative data, the author finds that diversity considerations do play a role in job offers, but as an implicit motivational force during job offer deliberations rather than an explicitly stated factor. A quantitative analysis complements the qualitative analysis: the author finds no female penalty on receiving an offer where one might be expected, which the author argues is due to implicit diversity considerations during hiring deliberations. The findings of this study have implications for theories of hiring discrimination, cultural fit as a legitimating tool, and motivating reasoning under strong pressures to diversify.",

          "abstract": "The “automaticity dominance” perspective on cognition and behavior holds that automatic processes guide most behavior because deliberate processing is slow, inefficient, and therefore rare, typically restricted to “problematic” situations. Other scholars argue on both theoretical and empirical grounds that deliberate processing is more common. In this study, the authors test automaticity dominance by using multinomial processing tree models to examine donation decisions in an online sample of 1,027 respondents. Using a mixture of preregistered and exploratory analyses on both experimental and observational data, the authors find that (1) the processes underlying donation behavior execute efficiently and rapidly, but key processes are also controllable; (2) deliberate cognition increases in problematic situations but also operates when levels of problematicity are low; and (3) respondents deliberately control (at a minimum) a substantial minority of their decisions. These results indicate that deliberate cognition might not be as rare as an automaticity dominance perspective suggests.",

          "authors": "Tyler W. McDaniel",
          "abstract": "In the era of school choice, much research has examined how families access nonneighborhood schools, but little attention has been given to families’ prior connections to nonneighborhood locations. This study examines how activity spaces —the places where people work, play, worship, and otherwise spend time—relate to school enrollments and, by extension, school segregation. Combining longitudinal data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey with school and neighborhood demographics, the study tests hypotheses derived from the social structural sorting perspective, which predict that families’ activity spaces will influence school sorting processes. First, among schools more than two miles from the home, families were twice as likely to enroll when the school was near a previous activity location. Second, net of residence, racially segregating prior activity spaces (consisting of higher own-group proportions than the neighborhood) predicted racially segregating school enrollments (in schools with higher own-group proportions than the neighborhood school). The results demonstrate links between activity space segregation and school segregation, with implications for larger patterns of social and educational stratification in the twenty-first century.",

          "abstract": "Although prior studies indicate that approximately 6 percent of the population will engage in racial identification switching (RIS), no prior research has explored the potential relation between RIS and health outcomes. Using the California birth cohort file from 2005 to 2015, the authors examine RIS among mothers identifying as non-Hispanic (NH) white or NH Black and with at least two live births over the test period ( n = 449,008). Using a sibling-control design, the authors compared perinatal health and sociodemographic characteristics of mothers with RIS over time against those without RIS. The authors also conducted logistic regression analyses predicting maternal race at the second birth after controlling for characteristics of the second birth. In sibling-control univariate results, mothers who switched from NH white to NH Black over time were more likely to deliver a low-weight infant, use public programs (e.g., Medicaid), and have less than a high school education relative to NH white mothers who did not change racial identity over time. Logistic regression results further indicate several socioeconomic (e.g., Medicaid) and health (e.g., low birth weight) factors related to RIS. The pattern of results indicate that health disparity research should carefully consider racial identity as a fluid construct which often varies with socioeconomic and health status.",

          "abstract": "How does private money flow to police departments, and what do these donations reveal about power and accountability in public safety? Although previous studies have focused on police foundations moving tens of millions of dollars, the authors’ research uncovers a broader, more complex ecosystem of private police financial support. Using a unique data license from GuideStar Candid—all nonprofit organization tax returns from 2014 to 2019—the authors describe a larger and integrated world of organizations moving private money to police. The authors introduce the concept of police finance organizations: private entities that supply material resources to police departments without facing the same levels of public accountability, regulations, and transparency requirements as the police departments themselves. This exploratory data analysis and social network methods revealed three types of these organizations: (1) connectors, which distribute resources across multiple police departments; (2) boosters, which donate exclusively to one police department; and (3) havens, which publicly and materially support police without officially reporting these gifts. Overall, the authors provide the most complete description of the vast and underestimated structure of private donations, redefining the understanding of private-public intersections in policing and raising new questions about accountability in public safety practice.",

          "abstract": "Despite initial declines in fertility since the onset of the pandemic, less is known about how fertility intentions are related to pandemic-based stressors in the United States. The authors examine the following two questions. First, how are pandemic stressors associated with short-term fertility intentions? Second, among those delaying fertility, what are the rationales for doing so, and how are pandemic stressors related to these rationales? The authors draw on the National Couples’ Health and Time Study, a nationally representative sample of 20- to 50-year-olds in the United States who were married or cohabiting and interviewed between September 2020 and April 2021. Among those desiring or remaining open to having (more) children, experiencing pandemic-related stressors was associated with delays in fertility plans; those whose lives were most disrupted and those who experienced relationship stress were less likely to intend to have children in the next year. The most common rationale for not intending to have children in the next year was economic worries, followed by health worries and concerns about an uncertain future. Economic and health stress were linked to these rationales, net of objective indicators. A comprehensive assessment of fertility intentions and underlying rationale for intentions on the basis of subjective factors is critical for understanding fertility patterns.",

          "authors": "Carolina Gallo Garcia",
          "abstract": "The author examines transnational narratives of women’s empowerment in Brazil, highlighting discourses promoting women’s ability to improve society and their incomes by mobilizing emotions and attributes linked to care responsibilities as savvy feminized skills to be used in micro entrepreneurship. On the basis of a case study through ethnographic research conducted between 2019 and 2022 within a national empowerment program for entrepreneurship training, the author argues that such initiatives are grounded in affective economies increasingly reliant on individualized forms of emotional labor as a central strategy to navigate the Brazilian labor market. By analyzing how emotions circulate within the social space of this corporate-sponsored training program, the author explores the role of affects in constituting power dynamics between those “already empowered” women promoting trainings and those yet to be shaped by the required affects to succeed. Drawing on theories of affective economies and governmentality, this study unravels some complexities of promoting empowerment and financial independence among women in the growing context of labor informality in Brazil. The author concludes by demonstrating how these narratives of empowerment create normative affective standards that rely on women’s emotional engagement with entrepreneurial values, often obscuring the precariousness underpinning their labor conditions.",
