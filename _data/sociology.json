          "title": "Rationality or Relationality in Life and Death: Regulating Organ Donation in Singapore and Taiwan",
          "authors": "Wan-Zi Lu",
          "abstract": "Lawmakers often attempt to settle conflicting values. However, we know little about how regulatory reasoning influences organizational practices and shapes the conditions under which people respond. This article examines unexpected outcomes of deceased organ donation in Singapore and Taiwan, whose governments have had to address cultural and emotional resistance to the practice. Adopting an opt-out law, Singapore created a larger pool of legal organ donors yet generated worse donation outcomes than Taiwan, whose opt-in regulation has resulted in a smaller pool of potential organ donors. Drawing from interviews and archival research to solve this puzzle, I argue that moral infrastructure—the regulation-endorsed organizational arrangements to tackle cultural and emotional tensions—determines whether and when people change their minds regarding shared cultural norms. Singapore’s regulation prioritizes instrumental rationality and generates efficiency-driven organizational practices. These practices lead to affective circumvention , sidestepping emotions to expedite organ procurement and, in turn, prompting patients’ families to withdraw from hospital care. By contrast, in Taiwan, relational reasoning creates arrangements that promote affective coordination , a process that empowers intermediaries to work with grieving families and morally reframe donation. An institutionalized emphasis on relationality fosters cooperation and provides opportunities to re moralize a contested practice.",

          "title": "Rethinking migrant reception in the age of color-blind racism: an experimental approach",
          "authors": "Michael Middleton",
          "abstract": "A large and robust literature has emerged in recent years that looks at the acceptance of migrants into Western countries. Surprisingly, these studies have consistently found that residents in Western countries accept non-White migrants at virtually the same level as White migrants. Missing from these studies is an engagement with racism in its modern form, which is often more “color-blind,” or hidden, rather than overtly expressed, and thus can be more difficult to capture. In this study, I ask the following questions: (1) What role do racialization processes play in attitudes toward migrants? and (2) Do these processes vary across different questions of acceptance? To answer these questions, this study utilizes Duboisian insight to argue that, while White attitudes toward non-White migrants may be positive in the abstract, when Whites are forced to give up their symbolic and material power in the process, this positive reception wanes. The study utilizes a conjoint design experimental online survey to test the acceptance of migrants applying for refugee status across multiple outcomes: (1) legal acceptance, which measures the acceptance across the physical border, and (2) symbolic acceptance, which measures the acceptance into American society. These findings replicate prior research in finding no significant difference between the legal acceptance of White and non-White migrants among White respondents. However, when the acceptance outcome becomes symbolic, this parity dissipates. This study contributes to the literature by adding a symbolic layer to migrant acceptance in the United States, an important distinction in the era of color-blind racism.",

          "title": "Unpacking the nexus of Islamic religiosity and attitudes towards individual liberties and gender equality: a person-centered analysis among Dutch Muslims",
          "authors": "Marija Dangubić, Fenella Fleischmann",
          "abstract": "Public discourses frequently portray religiosity as a problem for the emancipation of women and sexual minorities, and in Europe, Muslims are particularly singled out as threatening liberal values. Empirical studies indeed often document negative associations between Muslims’ religiosity and attitudes such as support for gender equality and acceptance of homosexuality. However, research so far mainly applied variable-centered analyses which neglect that there might be different ways in which Muslim minority members combine their religiosity and attitudes towards individual (sexual) liberties and gender equality. To provide a more differentiated understanding of these complex associations, we conduct a person-centered analysis and identify different subgroups in the Turkish- and Moroccan-origin oversample of the Netherlands Longitudinal Lifecourse Study (NELLS 2011, N = 1829). Two subgroups confirm findings from variable-centered approaches: we find a profile that combines high levels of religiosity with low acceptance of sexual liberalism, and one with the opposite pattern of low religiosity but high levels of acceptance of sexual liberalism and gender equality. A sizable additional subgroup combines high levels of religiosity with acceptance of homosexuality, and to a lesser extent divorce and chosen childlessness. Our findings suggest that the acceptance of homosexuality is particularly relevant in differentiating between subgroups of Muslims, whereas attitudes towards gender equality do not differ remarkably between profiles. In conclusion, liberal attitudes are complexly related to religiosity, warning against over-simplified interpretations of religion as generally threatening progressive values or the emancipation of minoritized groups on the basis of gender or sexuality.",

          "title": "Secularism, sorting, and Americans’ political knowledge",
          "authors": "Samuel L Perry",
          "abstract": "Political knowledge, including knowledge of basic civics and current political conditions, is associated with a host of pro-democratic outcomes including institutional trust and civic and political participation. Religion is also historically associated with these outcomes, yet a link between religion and indicators of political knowledge remains underexamined. Integrating research on religion/secularism and political engagement with work on partisan sorting, I theorize self-consciously secular Americans, particularly if they are sorted politically, will exhibit the strongest grasp on basic civics and current political conditions. Analyses of data from a recent, nationally representative survey affirm my expectations. Self-identified atheists/agnostics consistently score significantly higher than religious or non-affiliated Americans on questions about basic civics and current political conditions. Interactions reveal that education helps most other religious groups catch up to atheists/agnostics on civics knowledge, but not knowledge about current politics. And on knowledge of both basic civics and current politics, atheists/agnostics’ advantage is strongest among liberals and Democrats and disappears among conservatives and Republicans. A similar pattern appears for evangelical Protestants in the opposite direction with their scores on both civics and current politics increasing significantly as they identify more with ideological conservatism, but this does not apply to partisan identity. Findings extend literatures on political knowledge, religious/secular political engagement, and partisan sorting by showing that (1) self-identified secular Americans, particularly if they are sorted, tend to be the most knowledgeable about basic civics and current political conditions, and (2) this pattern is to a weaker extent mirrored by evangelicals, another politicized religious group.",

          "abstract": "Causal decomposition analysis aims to assess the effect of modifying risk factors on reducing social disparities in outcomes. Recently, this analysis has incorporated individual characteristics when modifying risk factors by utilizing optimal treatment regimes (OTRs). Since the newly defined individualized effects rely on the no omitted confounding assumption, developing sensitivity analyses to account for potential omitted confounding is essential. Moreover, OTRs and individualized effects are primarily based on binary risk factors, and no formal approach currently exists to benchmark the strength of omitted confounding using observed covariates for binary risk factors. To address this gap, we extend a simulation-based sensitivity analysis that simulates unmeasured confounders, addressing two sources of bias emerging from deriving OTRs and estimating individualized effects. Additionally, we propose a formal bounding strategy that benchmarks the strength of omitted confounding for binary risk factors. Using the High School Longitudinal Study 2009 (HSLS:09), we demonstrate this sensitivity analysis and benchmarking method.",

          "title": "Gender Egalitarianism and Marital Dissolution: Understanding the Bifurcation of the “Gender Revolution” in the United States",
          "authors": "Kimberly McErlean",
          "abstract": "In the context of women’s increased economic status coupled with declining divorce rates, the “gender revolution framework” suggests that greater gender equality in the division of labor has contributed to the stability of contemporary marriages. Yet recent research on this topic is not in consensus that this is the case. This study uses the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to test the hypothesis that progress toward gender egalitarianism, and associated changes in the relationship between the division of labor and divorce, is bifurcated across levels of education in the highly stratified United States. The results indicate modest support for the idea that the college educated have been vanguards of the progression of the gender revolution, but also that different forms of gender egalitarianism may have emerged across groups. Among college-educated couples, gender egalitarian and gender-specialized arrangements have similar risks of divorce in recent years, in line with an egalitarian essentialist perspective. Among less educated couples, results suggest that progress toward gender equality in paid labor may reflect economic need rather than shifting gender norms. Together, these findings illustrate how structural and cultural changes in the organization of work and family life have played out differently across levels of education.",

          "authors": "Anna Zajacova, Samuel Fishman, Elizabeth M. Lawrence",
          "abstract": "Although the education-health gradient is well documented, relatively little is known about its application to cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of mortality in the United States. Furthermore, critical nuances across educational levels and demographic subgroups remain underexplored. The authors examine the association between education and CVD among U.S. adults entering mid-adulthood, leveraging a novel symptom-based CVD index capturing clinical indicators such as angina or dyspnea and a detailed 13-category measure of educational attainment. Waves I and V of the nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health sample ( n = 11,806) are analyzed for the full cohort and by sex/gender and race/ethnicity; models also account for adolescent confounders and adulthood social and economic mediators. The findings reveal profound disparities: adults with professional or doctoral degrees report 0.6 CVD symptoms on average, versus 1.8 among those without high school credentials, a threefold difference. However, there are also important deviations from the expected gradient. Adults with sub-baccalaureate education report no fewer symptoms than high school graduates, whereas General Educational Development diploma recipients resemble dropouts more than diploma holders. Racial/ethnic patterns differ markedly: most strikingly, Black adults derive no significant CVD returns from college completion compared with high school graduation. These patterns challenge assumptions about education’s universal benefits and underscore the importance of structural and intersectional approaches to addressing health disparities and designing equitable health policies.",

          "abstract": "Does exposure to migrant death alter immigration-related public opinion? Scholarship has extensively demonstrated the impact of events on attitudes toward immigrants and immigration. In doing so, however, focus has almost exclusively been placed on events that pose a direct threat to ingroup members. The authors extend this line of research to further comprehend the formative basis of the said attitudes by focusing on events that uncover the threats outgroup members are subjected to, such as migrant shipwrecks. The authors examine one of the deadliest migrant shipwrecks that have occurred in the Mediterranean Sea in recent history, the so-called 2013 Lampedusa shipwreck, in which at least 368 migrants lost their lives. Using Italian data from the European Social Survey (round 6), the authors show that in the aftermath of the event, attitudes toward immigration changed, and Italians became more willing to adopt a less restrictive immigration policy. However, attitudes toward immigrants remained unchanged: the levels of perceived ethnic threat were not altered. These findings not only expand on the prevailing understanding of the effect of salient migration events on immigration-related attitudes but also highlight the divergent formative basis of these attitudes.",

          "authors": "Jisu Park, Sarah Damaske, Jiwon Choi, Susan McHale, Joshua Rosenberger, Junjun Yin",
          "abstract": "The authors examine the gendered perceptions of workplace challenges in the male-dominated fields of computer science, engineering, and mathematics (CSEM). Using novel qualitative and quantitative data from an online survey of 3,556 cisgender CSEM professionals, the authors explore how women and men differently perceive workplace challenges in domains that are central to gendered organizational theory. In stark contrast to prior research that suggests science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professionals embrace purportedly meritocratic and “gender-neutral” cultural schemas, the present findings reveal that women in CSEM are significantly more likely than men to perceive workplace challenges across multiple areas and the biggest gender disparities are reported in the recognition of structural barriers. The authors further investigate how job tenure moderates these gendered perceptions. Longer tenure is linked to lower perceptions of workplace challenges among men, whereas women’s perceptions of structural barriers remain consistent over time, and reports of interpersonal difficulties become more frequent as tenure increases. These findings suggest that tenure, rather than buffering women from inequality, may amplify gendered burdens, reinforcing disparities in how organizational experiences are seen and navigated. By highlighting both the persistence of gendered perceptions and the role of job tenure, this study advances understanding of how inequality is perceived and reproduced within contemporary STEM workplaces.",
