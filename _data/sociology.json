          "authors": "Mark Wittek, Xinwei Xu",
          "abstract": "We examine the gendered distribution of peer-ascribed status in schools. Using network data from more than 14,000 students in 676 classrooms, we explore gender differences in the ascription of status and the types of behavior rewarded with status. On average, girls receive slightly fewer status ascriptions than boys, and students tend to grant status more frequently within the same gender. Contextual analyses show that classroom demographics can moderate some of these patterns. We also uncover gender-specific differences and similarities in status-related behaviors. Notably, girls engaging in substance use are awarded with slightly more status ascriptions than boys. However, network models reveal that most behaviors affect peer status similarly for both genders, suggesting that previous findings of gender-behavioral differences based on regression analysis may be conflated with network processes. Our study updates long-held notions regarding gendered status orders in schools and highlights the value of a multidimensional approach to status processes. We discuss implications for future social network research on status ascriptions and other relational cognitions and consider how school-based interventions might benefit from our findings.",

          "authors": "Enying Zheng, Wei Hong, Yasheng Huang, Rongzhu Ke",
          "abstract": "We explore how institutional designs can have unintended consequences, especially by rewiring social networks. Using archival data on the civil-service examinations in historical China, we argue that the enforcement of a regional quota system in 1427 reshaped group boundaries along native place, turned emotional affinities for one’s hometown into political stakes, and reinforced the influence of native place ties among political elites. Analyzing approximately 30,000 individual records, we confirm this argument by documenting a macro-level shift from a highly unequal to a more balanced provincial distribution of students who passed the examinations following the enforcement of the quota system. As native place became a primary basis for network homophily, elites deliberately cultivated these connections, seizing the opportunity as ad hoc examiners to provide preferential treatment based on shared place of origin. Our micro-level analysis of 12,752 passing students between 1400 and 1580 identifies this in-group favoritism, with examiners often ranking students from their own provinces higher. A mechanism of safeguarding political stakes underscores this baseline effect, which became more pronounced during the quota stage, especially under weaker state capacity, among examiners from disadvantaged provinces, and when examiners had greater vested interest in their hometown. These findings enrich theories of group boundaries and categorization, network homophily and formation, and the unintended consequences of institutional designs while also providing policy insights for affirmative action.",

          "authors": "Amy Kroska, Sarah K. Harkness, Kelsey N. Mattingly, Mollie A. Lovera",
          "abstract": "Many studies suggest that people discriminate against individuals with a mental illness. Despite these generally robust patterns, however, variability in the results from laboratory experiments examining competence-based discrimination leaves questions about the specific diagnoses that elicit the discrimination and gender differences in the discriminatory behavior. Therefore, we revisit this question with a design aimed at clarifying some of the ambiguities. We examine the effects of two diagnoses (schizophrenia and depression) and a nonpsychiatric health problem (the need for leg surgery). As with other laboratory studies, we examine if and how a teammate’s psychiatric diagnosis affects participants’ willingness to accept the teammate’s problem-solving suggestions in a two-person task group. But we go beyond the previous studies by crossing the teammate gender with participant gender and by exploring the robustness in our results by examining the moderating role of numerous participant attributes (e.g., education, social desirability, parents’ education, age, political liberalism, three gender ideology scales, trust in others). We find that participants discriminate against teammates with both types of psychiatric diagnoses but not against teammates with the nonpsychiatric health problem and that this pattern is highly robust: The processes are almost entirely unrelated to teammate gender and participant attributes, including participant gender. Together, these results suggest that both schizophrenia and depression elicit competence-based discrimination, that these processes differ very little by participants’ demographic and attitudinal attributes, and that the status beliefs underlying this discrimination may be fairly uniform.",

          "authors": "Michelle Smirnova, Jordan Ayala, Clara Irazábal",
          "abstract": "Homelessness and housing insecurity are often isolating experiences in the United States, where housing and well-being are constructed as individual responsibilities. In this context, mobilization around housing injustice can be challenging. The authors argue that the intersection of the Black Lives Matter protests, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, and housing injustice created a powder keg for social action that was capitalized upon by a local tenant union and social movement organization called Kansas City Tenants. Through a real-time analysis of Kansas City Tenants, a grassroots organization with national reach, the authors explore how it managed to recruit diverse members to the organization, direct sustainable and impactful action toward the needs of those in crisis, and lay the groundwork for future policy and revolutionary initiatives both institutionally and extrainstitutionally.",

          "abstract": "The #MeToo movement illustrated how higher-ups may abuse their power by engaging in sexual harassment and generated heightened concern about hierarchical workplace romantic relationships. In a survey experiment, the authors test whether sexual attention from a superordinate outside one’s reporting chain (desired or not) leads to stereotyping and resultant career penalties. A woman employee who reported sexual harassment was seen as less warm and more attention seeking and cutthroat but also more assertive and willing to speak truth to power, although some perceptions varied by the harassment type. A woman who declared a romantic relationship with a superordinate was viewed as less committed to the organization. This stereotyping did not translate to workplace penalties apart from a marginally significant raise penalty against the woman who reported unwanted sexual advances. However, the authors find that experiencing sexual attention from a superordinate, whether desired or not, is damaging to working women’s reputations.",

          "abstract": "What repercussions does Islamist terrorism have for Arab/Muslim minorities in targeted countries? We highlight consequences in the domain of online real estate rental. Using high-frequency data on all transactions happening on the largest Parisian online rental market over the period of November 2014 to March 2018, we are able to trace the evolution of prices and occupancy rates over time. We demonstrate that discrimination against properties hosted by Arab/Muslims rises swiftly in the aftermath of the terror attacks in November 2015 and wanes at a much slower pace. We quantify the average financial loss per listing that results from increased discrimination to equal $178 per month. Our findings not only highlight the presence of discrimination in peer-to-peer transactions but also show how sharing economy data measuring these transactions can be used as a “seismograph” to track and measure the development of discriminatory attitudes in response to societal events.",

          "authors": "Esther Chan, Di Di",
          "abstract": "Researchers have explored the relationship between religiosity and people’s gendered perspectives within the private sphere. However, there is limited research on how religiosity relates to people’s gendered perspectives in the public sphere. The authors examine the association between religiosity and the view that men make better leaders than women in two public spheres, politics and business, and explore variations by national context. Drawing on data collected in 44 national contexts, the analysis reveals that individuals with higher religious attendance are more inclined to support men’s leadership over women’s leadership in both political and business domains. Notably, this relationship is nuanced by a country’s level of economic development. Greater religiosity is associated with greater support for men’s leadership in more economically developed countries, whereas the reverse occurs in countries with lower economic development. The findings urge a more critical examination of religion’s role in shaping global perspectives on gender equity.",
