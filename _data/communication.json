          "authors": "Hagar Lahav, Zvi Reich, C W Anderson",
          "abstract": "Despite its crucial role in the epistemology of journalism, journalists’ reliance on common- sense has received little and unsystematic scholarly attention. This conceptual paper calls for placing common-sense at the center of the epistemology of news, while underpinning it with a more systematic approach that draws not only from journalism studies but also from philosophy and political science. The paper discusses the conditions appropriate for the deployment of journalistic common-sense. We argue that journalists are well positioned to become custodians of common-sense, whose role is to develop higher commonsensical literacy among decision-makers and audiences, and to promote a more conscious, cautious, and reflective approach to this influential yet taken-for-granted concept. Finally, we offer two potential reasons why journalism studies have neglected common-sense as a research subject.",

          "abstract": "Creativity is widely understood as a distinct human characteristic, yet the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping creative ecosystems, presenting both opportunities and challenges. Despite these advancements, comprehensive insights into how social groups, especially stakeholders, perceive and experience AI-generated art remain inadequate. Through semi-structured interviews with 23 artistic practitioners in China across visual art domains such as painting, design, and filmmaking, this study identifies themes related to practitioners’ perceptions of the creative process (mechanism and time), created works (aesthetic and quality), and creating actors (role and ownership) from a human-AI comparative view. Contextualized perceptions shaped by variations across art domains are also revealed. As human-AI collaboration in artistic creation gains prominence, this study also illustrates how artistic practitioners negotiate their agency with machine agency through dual routes: the affective route and the action route. The findings contribute to the ongoing discourse of artificial creativity, enrich the socio-technical understandings of AI-generated visual art and shed light on the agency dynamics between human and AI within the context of artistic creation.",

          "abstract": "This article deals with the different strategies transnational streamers use to integrate programming in different markets, specifically looking at language and how it is couched within a wider network of strategies to formulate transnational appeal. The article will look specifically at German language programming on Netflix and Amazon, and the different strategies they use to appeal to viewers. Netflix relies on what I call a ‘grammar of transnationalism’ and the use of so-called ‘high German’ while Amazon relies on a strategy of localisation by relying on local stars. Further, localisation relies on the linking with local cultural histories of television. The comparison illuminates how platforms operate in the current streaming environment.",

Instead of focusing solely on individual aging factors and the digitally relevant divide, this approach enables an in-depth analysis of how older adults’ experiences with misinformation can be constrained by structural factors and the broader digital landscape, alongside information policies in local contexts as the broader background. Meanwhile, this approach allows for a contextualized comprehension of the agency of older adults, illuminating their prioritization of news values which might not always lie in the authenticity. Guided by this approach, our study gives voice to the low-income older female adults in China, revealing their ongoing engagement with misinformation during the COVID-19 infodemic where exacerbated digitalized information inequalities were likely to be accompanied by their evolving definition of misinformation and information sharing behaviors.",

          "authors": "Pedro Gallo, Catalina Iordache",
          "abstract": "This research investigates the intricate process of localising subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) services on a transnational scale, with a specific focus on the translation of Spanish ‘original’ and ‘exclusive’ works of Netflix and Prime Video. As SVOD companies expand their services internationally, the necessity of adapting to diverse national markets becomes paramount. Language emerges as a pivotal factor in this process: audiovisual works must provide adequate subtitling and dubbing options to address the diverse linguistic nuances of international audiences. The research aims to analyse the language localisation strategies for Spanish works in transnational SVOD services, by examining the dubbing and subtitling options offered. The article provides a mapping of the strategies and partners adopted by these companies focussing on a sample of local works. Additionally, by collecting data from the two SVOD services and through interviews with dubbing studios, the research analyses mergers, acquisitions and power relations between dubbing companies, as well as the impact on competition generated by transnational streaming services. Both Netflix and Amazon have increasingly added more language options for content offerings as part of their internationalisation, which has favoured the proliferation of a specific type of company and business model in the dubbing sector. This consists of transnational corporations that have provided localisation services in the wake of the internationalisation of streamers, and that have managed to keep up with the demands through mergers and acquisitions with studios in foreign countries.",

          "authors": "Jessica Hoare, Rhys Miles Thomas, Paul Burke, Sally Lisk-Lewis, Greg Mothersdale",
          "abstract": "The increasing adoption of Virtual Production (VP) technologies in TV and film production may have the potential to offer expanded inclusivity, greater creativity, logistical advantages, and improved sustainability. This paper explores such claims in the context of the diversity and inclusion, and the increasing attention being paid to issues of accessibility and inclusivity for d/Deaf, Disabled, and Neurodivergent (DDN) cast and crew within TV and film production. The paper presents a case study of We Dream of Nothing and Flying Without Wings , two test shoots which developed and implemented accessible VP working practices, addressing the access requirements of DDN cast and crew. These productions were conducted as cycles of co-developed participatory action research, as part of an industry–academia R&amp;D collaboration, in which accessibility interventions were planned, implemented, observed, and reflected on collaboratively. Drawing on a case study, the paper takes steps to propose an emergent Inclusive Virtual Production Framework for accessibility, integrating inclusive practice across all stages of production, from pre-production and recruitment to on-set workflow. It documents a developing model of accessibility intervention in which the affordances of VP facilitate DDN inclusion centred on dignity, respect, and collaboration. The paper highlights practices that enable DDN talent and leadership on set, detailing the work and accessibility practices tested and developed across the two productions. Situated within broader debates of screen sector workforce inequality and equity, this paper addresses the long-standing underrepresentation of DDN individuals in both creative and technical roles. Despite many initiatives which have promoted diversity targets, truly inclusive working practices are yet to become standardised on set. In response, this paper proposes working practices that enable DDN inclusivity. As part of its knowledge equity approach, the paper offers first person reflections on the process and the challenges from the project team. Finally, we summarise both the challenges and the significant opportunities presented by VP technologies to create thriving, equitable production environments.",

This cross-sectional online survey of 1,764 participants aged 16–28 (75.7 percent women) identified four addiction subtypes using specific scales. Network analysis revealed significant comorbidity (95.35 percent) among subtypes, with smartphone addiction playing a dominant role, leading to social media, Internet, and potentially game addiction. High comorbidity suggests a shared vulnerability, with smartphone use as a catalyst. Smartphone addiction is a key precursor to other digital addictions.",

          "abstract": "Free video-sharing platforms such as YouTube are highly popular among young children but may contain low-quality and highly commercialized content. This study aimed to describe the prevalence, duration, and timing of objectively measured mobile YouTube viewing in preschool-aged children and test hypotheses about associations with child individual differences and contextual factors. We analyzed mobile sampling data from 349 English-speaking children aged 3–4.99 years whose parents completed surveys about child, parent, and household characteristics. We assessed whether the child ever viewed YouTube during the sampling week and calculated average daily duration in a subsample of 121 participants with their own mobile devices. We built multivariable logistic regression models to test correlates of mobile YouTube viewership and duration. Children were 3.82 years ( SD 0.53), 74.6 percent white non-Hispanic; parents were mostly mothers (93.7 percent), 34.0 ( SD 4.6) years, and 37.9 percent had less than a college degree. Mobile YouTube viewing (37.0 percent of children) was more likely in children who used Android devices, shared mobile devices with family members, were older, attended home-based childcare, or had parents with lower educational attainment. Median YouTube duration was 61.2 min/day, with longer durations in children whose parents had lower educational attainment. These results demonstrate that many young children use free video-sharing platforms on mobile devices for long durations, and this practice may be disproportionately higher in children from lower socioeconomic status. Longitudinal research is needed on video-sharing platform viewing and child outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Extending previous research on creative AI to the context of AI advertising, the present study examined whether creativity in AI advertising could evoke perceptions of uncanniness and consequently have a negative impact on ad outcomes. Based on a two (ad creativity: low vs. high) by two (creator label: human vs. AI) between-subjects experimental design, the present study showed that ad creativity in general had a positive direct impact on attitude toward the ad (A ad ), attitude toward the brand (A b ), and purchase intentions. In addition, there were significant mediation effects of perceived creativity on A ad and A b via perceived uncanniness, which was moderated by creator label. For the AI-creator-labeled condition, perceived creativity had negative indirect effects on A ad and A b via perceived uncanniness, such that greater perceived creativity led to greater perceived uncanniness, which in turn induced less favorable A ad and A b . However, the mediation effect was not found for the human-creator-labeled condition. Thus, the positive effect of ad creativity was smaller for the AI-creator-labeled ad.",

          "abstract": "This article examines how participatory publics persist in depopulated rural areas during periods of low visibility and mobilization. Drawing on pragmatism and mediatization theory, we analyse communicative figurations in Castilla-La Mancha (Spain) using survey data ( N = 529) and develop a Participatory Public Connection Index. Regression models reveal that public connection is driven more by communicative and territorial factors – such as local radio use, civic motivations and municipality size – than by sociodemographics. Our findings suggest that local media help sustain symbolic bonds and latent publics, contributing to democratic engagement and territorial cohesion despite the absence of visible collective action. We conceptualize latency as the communicative and symbolic potential through which publics persist beyond visible mobilization; operationally, the Participatory Public Connection Index captures this latent connection sustained by everyday local media practices.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Promoting employees’ innovative use of artificial intelligence (AI) is critical for organizations to gain benefits from the implemented AI. By employing the job demands-resources (JD-R) model as the overarching theoretical lens, this study focuses on how employees' perceptions of AI augmentation knowledge as an empowering resource (i.e. AI knowledge empowerment) affect their innovative use behaviors of AI, as well as how uncertainties in work scenarios (i.e. work uncertainty) and AI (i.e. AI technological uncertainty) moderate this relationship. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from a longitudinal survey of 443 employees in a large power business company in China. Using hierarchical multiple regression to test the research model. Findings Results showed that AI knowledge empowerment exerts a positive impact on innovative use of AI. Furthermore, we found that work uncertainty strengthens the positive effect of AI knowledge empowerment on innovative use of AI, while AI technological uncertainty weakens the positive relationship between AI knowledge empowerment and innovative use of AI. Originality/value This study provides an in-depth understanding of the effect of AI augmentation knowledge from the perspective of psychological empowerment on innovative use behavior and how the effect varies across different types of work and AI technological uncertainties based on the JD-R model.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Human-generative artificial intelligence (AI) cooperation (HGAIC) offers new opportunities for knowledge collaboration in online knowledge communities (OKCs). However, existing studies neglect to explore how different HGAIC strategies (exploitative and explorative) affect knowledge collaboration (knowledge acquisition and contribution) under the influence of GAI capabilities (generativity, autonomy and interactivity) and OKC factors (question variety and platform involvement). This means there is a lack of sufficient theoretical and practical guidelines on promoting flexible HGAIC to enhance knowledge collaboration in OKC. Design/methodology/approach The partial least squares structural equation modeling method was employed to analyze data from 355 OKC users, and the vignette experiment method was used to analyze data from 345 OKC users. Findings The findings indicate that both exploitative and explorative cooperation positively affect knowledge acquisition and contribution. GAI generativity, GAI autonomy, GAI interactivity and platform involvement positively affect both exploitative and explorative cooperation. In contrast, question variety only significantly enhances exploitative cooperation. Furthermore, the structured antecedents can enhance knowledge acquisition and contribution by facilitating exploitative and explorative cooperation. In addition, creative time pressure weakens the positive relationship between exploitative cooperation and knowledge contribution while enhancing the positive relationship between explorative cooperation and knowledge contribution. Originality/value First, this study classifies HGAIC into exploitative and explorative cooperation and reveals their crucial roles in knowledge collaboration in OKC. Second, this study supplements and examines the ASTI framework, identifying the antecedents and outcomes of exploitative and explorative cooperation. Finally, this study emphasizes the bidirectional moderating role of creative time pressure in the impact of exploitative and explorative cooperation on knowledge contribution.",

          "authors": "Honghong Huo, Qingfei Min, Dezhi Wu, Zilong Liu",
          "abstract": "Purpose Driven by advances in social technologies, various social cues–including friend approval, peer favorability and marketer endorsement–have been integrated into social media advertising (SMA) to counter the growing trend of user avoidance. However, the underlying mechanisms and boundary conditions through which these cues reduce SMA avoidance remain unclear. Drawing on construal level theory, this study investigates how social cues of varying relational distances mitigate SMA avoidance depending on product preference. Design/methodology/approach Two between-subjects factorial experiments (N = 243 and 244) were designed and conducted on a self-developed platform to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings The results reveal that social cues reduce user avoidance through two distinct mediating mechanisms: enhancing perceived attractiveness and mitigating perceived intrusiveness. Moreover, these indirect effects are moderated by product preference: remote cues (e.g. marketer endorsement) are more effective for low-preference products, whereas proximal cues (e.g. friend approval) are more effective for high-preference products. Practical implications The findings offer actionable implications for marketers and platforms, highlighting strategies for optimizing social cues to balance attractiveness and intrusiveness across different product preferences, thereby supporting more user-friendly SMA experiences. Originality/value This study identifies two mechanisms–attractiveness and intrusiveness–underlying SMA avoidance, systematically compares different types of social cues through the lens of social distance, and demonstrates how the match between social cues and product preference operates from a construal level theory perspective. Thus, it advances understanding of SMA avoidance and social cue effects while extending construal level theory to the context of SMA.",

          "authors": "Weiwei Liu, Lingyan Hu",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study examines the impact of gamified work on knowledge hiding among gig workers from the perspective of regulatory focus theory. Design/methodology/approach To validate the proposed theoretical model, we conducted three studies. Study 1 was an experiment with a 2 (gamified work: absence vs presence) between-subjects design. Studies 2 and 3 were surveys. Findings The main results revealed several key findings. First, gamified work increased self-efficacy. Second, gamified work inhibited knowledge hiding through self-efficacy. Third, gamified work increased affective rumination. Fourth, gamified work facilitated knowledge hiding through affective rumination. Finally, task-technology fit served as a moderating factor in these relationships. Practical implications Organizations are encouraged to design dynamic and personalized gamified work systems. Additionally, psychological development initiatives should be implemented to enhance workers' self-efficacy. A psychological support mechanism could also be established to alleviate affective rumination. Furthermore, ensuring an optimal task-technology fit remains crucial. These strategies are expected to effectively mitigate knowledge hiding behaviors. Originality/value Most studies on knowledge hiding have focused on formal employees within traditional firm settings, often overlooking those working outside the conventional economic framework, such as gig workers. This study focuses on gig workers, uncovering the mechanisms through which gamified work influences knowledge hiding and offering practical insights for knowledge management in platform-based enterprises.",

          "abstract": "Social avoidance is a prevalent mental health problem. While most previous studies have predominantly focused on interpersonal interventions, these approaches often face challenges. An alternative may lie in considering environmental factors. Based on the internal working model, we propose that attachment to a personally significant place may help reduce social avoidance in general contexts. We conducted three studies employing different methodologies to examine this effect, while also exploring the mediating roles of social connectedness and nature connectedness. Study 1 ( N = 1,307) used two-wave questionnaire surveys to explore the relationships among the variables. Study 2a ( N = 224) and Study 2b ( N = 239) applied recalling and imagination paradigms to manipulate place attachment and measured social avoidance as the outcome variable. The results showed that attachment to a significant place can reduce social avoidance by fostering both social connectedness and nature connectedness. Notably, the indirect effect of social connectedness was stronger than that of nature connectedness. These findings suggest that activating place attachment can enhance individuals’ connections with both society and nature, thereby reducing social avoidance in general contexts. This research provides insights into the internal working model of place attachment and the development of intervention strategies aiming at social avoidance.",

The study highlights the precarious nature of investigative journalism in Ghana, exposing safety and security concerns faced by journalists. The effects of increasing attacks on journalist’s practices and behavior include constant fear, anxiety, psychological stress, post-traumatic stress, and financial concerns. These challenges force many journalists to self-censor by avoiding investigative reporting altogether. The study advocates for the effective implementation of the Right to Information Act, robust legal protections, training, and insurance coverage for investigative journalists.",

          "abstract": "This article examines Mapa Verde, a participatory digital mapping project co-created by young environmental activists and academic researchers in Uruguay between 2023 and 2025, from the perspective of participatory action research along with social and technopolitical cartography. Drawing on the observation and systematization of collaborative workshops, revision of periodical reports of activities and outcomes, and in-depth interviews with the young activists involved in the participatory cartography, the article reconstructs and interrogates the co-creation process: diagnosis, construction, and evaluation (Calvo &amp;amp; Candón-Mena, 2023). It also analyzes youth imaginaries regarding digital media activism and environmental advocacy through counter-mapping. Pragmatic and critical imaginaries of digital media for activism are found among the young participants who created Mapa Verde, while the collaborative enterprise reflects community-based communication and some traces of counter-data mapping that strengthen identity and foster inter-organizational collaboration. The project expands participatory cartography practices in political ecology and environmental communication, highlighting youth as both agents and cartographers of environmental action. The process shows that mapping is not only a technical exercise but also political, cultural, and pedagogical, enabling new forms of participation and knowledge production.",

          "authors": "Sarah Elwood",
          "abstract": "Critical digital geographies scholarship has a well-developed repertoire for theorizing adverse relations between technology, media, society, and space, setting up an enduring ambivalence in the analysis of minor, small-scale, improvisational efforts to rewrite these relations. At this impasse, I argue for an intentional turn to analytic frames rooted in queer of color critique, such as methodologies of hope. This approach emerges from Jose Esteban Muñoz’s writings on queer futurities, which he crafted as an epistemological-political frame for apprehending hope, justice, and life-affirming futures from positions of deep material and ideological exclusion. Muñoz’s approach offers vital off-ramps from the theoretical cycles of negation found in much critical digital geography thought. My article demonstrates how orienting to minoritarian digital activisms through a queer methodology of hope illuminates dynamic cycles of critique and creation that transgress accepted limits to urban inhabitations and demonstrate normatively unthinkable, yet already existing, possibilities for being and being in relation in the city. I demonstrate this approach through a close reading of the digital mediations and mediatizations advanced in the social media tactics of Stop the Sweeps Seattle, a local collective fighting the systematic eviction of tent encampments of unsheltered people by municipal authorities. A queer relational analysis of these emplaced politics illuminates the digital, material, and ideological pathways they forge toward staying put and living well in the city against seemingly impossible odds.",

          "title": "Managing learning demands through mobile AI: A cognitive load perspective on ChatGPT use in Nepal",
          "authors": "Shwadhin Sharma, Anita Khadka",
          "abstract": "This study investigates how students perceive mobile, generative AI tools such as ChatGPT as regulating cognitive load and emotional demands during learning. The research examines how AI-mediated mobile communication affects intrinsic, extraneous, and germane cognitive load, and how these perceptions influence mental effort, cognitive engagement, learning anxiety, and perceived academic performance. The study is situated in Nepal, where mobile learning and smartphone-based educational practices often substitute for limited institutional support. Guided by Cognitive Load Theory, a structural equation model was developed to examine relationships between perceived AI-mediated load types and student outcomes. The model was tested using survey data from 314 higher education students who had experience using ChatGPT through mobile devices. Results show that students who perceived ChatGPT as reducing extraneous load and enhancing germane load reported lower anxiety and higher cognitive engagement. These perceptions were also associated with higher perceived academic performance and more efficient mental effort. Intrinsic load remained a significant constraint but was mitigated when ChatGPT was used as a mobile scaffold in complex learning tasks. This is one of the first theory-driven studies to empirically test how students perceive generative AI's influence on multiple dimensions of cognitive load in mobile learning environments. The research contributes theoretical and empirical insights to information systems and educational technology by reframing mobile AI not merely as a usability tool but as a mechanism for cognitive load management and emotional regulation in under-resourced educational systems. The findings offer practical guidance for educators and instructional designers seeking to integrate generative AI into mobile learning strategies. ChatGPT can serve as a portable cognitive and emotional support system that clarifies complex concepts, reduces learning anxiety, and enhances engagement. Incorporating guided mobile AI use into coursework can improve learning efficiency and emotional well-being without increasing instructional workload, particularly in resource-constrained higher education settings.",

          "authors": "Sarah LF Burnham, Miriam R Arbeit",
          "abstract": "Current theories and measures of social media literacy are politically neutral, which poses a problem as far-right influences permeate mainstream social media platforms. The theory of Anti-Oppressive Social Media Literacy describes three orientations social media users may display toward far-right content: endorsement of far-right content, ambivalence toward far-right content, or rejection of far-right content. Based on this theory, we created a survey measure in which participants were asked to rate their likelihood of responding in various ways to hypothetical social media posts that included far-right dog whistles. Our sample of 14 young adults aged 18–24 consisted of 57% Black participants, 71% full-time students, and 71% people who worked at least part-time. We conducted cognitive interviews to examine how participants interpreted these scenarios and their response items. Findings revealed the measure’s overall effectiveness and identified actionable revisions. This study can inform future measure development based on Anti-Oppressive Social Media Literacy.",

          "authors": "Sarah Burkhardt, Thomas Poell",
          "abstract": "This article examines the mediation of sexual misconduct in the Netherlands, focusing on the role of public television broadcasting and Twitter. Conceptually, the article draws on key feminist perspectives, which have, over the past decades, been vital for turning sexual misconduct into a central issue of public concern. Our analysis of Dutch public broadcasting (1984–2019) and Twitter (2011–2019) reveals that Dutch television consistently advocated feminist perspectives and framed sexual misconduct as a national problem rooted in ‘internal’ structural failures. By contrast, Twitter discourse, particularly since 2015, was dominated by far-right rhetoric, framing the issue as an ‘external’ cultural threat linked to Islam and immigration. #MeToo was not visible in the dominant Twitter discourse on sexual misconduct but did appear on public television. Nevertheless, Dutch public broadcasters’ feminist agenda remained limited, failing to debunk the hypervisible racist and Islamophobic perpetrator myths circulating on Dutch social media.",

          "abstract": "This article investigates the persistence and transformation of Andrew Tate’s presence on YouTube following the removal of his official channels in August 2022. Combining two empirical approaches—a small-scale analysis of top-ranked videos from YouTube search results in 2022 and 2024, and a large-scale data set of over 112k videos—we examine how Tate-related content continues to circulate and how the platform moderates such material. Our findings show that Tate remains highly visible through a diffuse and decentralized network of actors who repackage his messaging into interviews, remixes, and YouTube-native formats. This configuration produces what we term the “Tate-space”: an ambient ideological environment where motivational rhetoric, aspirational masculinity, and far-right talking points converge. We find that YouTube’s substantial moderation efforts are outpaced by the speed and scale of recommendation-driven circulation and that deplatforming, while symbolically significant, fails to disrupt the cultural and logistical dynamics that sustain Tate’s influence.",

          "authors": "Salma Bouchafra, Mathilda Åkerlund",
          "abstract": "This article examines the visual securitising discourse of Sweden Democrats (SD) through a qualitatively centred analysis of the party’s 2024 European Union (EU) election campaign and its official election slogan ‘My Europe Builds Walls: Against Immigration, Against Criminal Gangs, Against Islamists’. Through a comparative, cross-platform multimodal critical discourse analysis (MCDA) of SD’s posts on Facebook, X and TikTok, this article explores the differences in campaign content across platforms, and analyses how these differences provide insights into the party’s understanding of its audiences and the platforms’ respective functionalities. The analysis shows how SD leveraged platform functionalities to balance textual and visual features, repost content, and incorporate hyperlinks on Facebook and X. Using these features, the party posted text-laden, argumentative and seemingly informative posts, which are likely to appeal not only to the customary format of content on the platforms but also to its respective audiences. Yet, although SD had larger followings and much more well-established accounts on both Facebook and X, the party posted the majority of its campaign material on TikTok, primarily in the form of memes. These memes tended to include securitising clips of non-white men engaging in violent protests, vandalism and violence directed towards the local community and law enforcement. We discuss the role these memes play in the SD election campaign and the potential implications such content might have.",

          "authors": "Yansheng Liu, Jingshi Kang, S Shyam Sundar",
          "abstract": "In 2022, the Chinese government implemented a policy requiring social media platforms to display approximate user location (province/municipality in China or country if abroad) on their posts, thus making location a visible cue. How does this cue affect readers’ perceptions of the source and content of the post? To investigate this, we conducted a four-condition (user location: Beijing vs. Guizhou vs. the United States vs. no location) between-subjects online experiment ( N = 240) that examined how the displayed location of a social media user influenced viewers’ psychological responses to online self-disclosure messages. We also tested for two psychological mediators: perceived homophily and perceived spatial distance. We found that the displayed location of the poster (i.e., the individual who makes the social media post) affected readers’ perceived homophily and in turn their responses (empathy, source liking, perceived social distance) to support-seeking self-disclosure messages on social media. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed.",

          "abstract": "The formation of the Digital Services Act (DSA) in the European Union (EU), aiming to regulate platform power, provided a unique policy window to secure media-specific interests vis-à-vis platforms. This study investigates how Norwegian news media actors utilised the policy window. Drawing on qualitative interviews with 20 elite informants in Norway and the EU, the analysis shows how the Norwegian actors strategised to protect editorial independence and autonomy by lobbying to exempt editorial content from platform moderation. Unable to build a broad coalition and facing substantial resistance from an alliance of platforms, fact-checkers, and civil society groups, the attempt failed. The study contributes with insight into how news actors from a small, non-EU member state lobbied to gain influence in a policy process at the EU level. It also illustrates how the blurring boundaries of journalism and the multifaceted European media landscape make supranational news media lobbying particularly demanding for small, outsider actors.",

          "abstract": "This study employs attribution theory to examine how adult daughters from low‐income backgrounds perceive and manage low‐quality daughter‐mother relationships. Using in‐depth interviews and flexible coding, we analyzed how daughters ( n = 42) attribute locus, responsibility, specificity, and stability. Daughters often located control internally within their mothers, citing enduring traits as sources of conflict while noting external influences such as trauma or substance abuse. Responsibility was frequently self‐assumed despite blaming mothers, positioning attribution as a means of asserting agency. Many saw their relationships as uniquely difficult and consistent, reinforcing perceptions of stability and specificity. Our study extends attribution theory to long‐term family bonds, portraying adult daughters as active agents in meaning‐making across the life course.",
