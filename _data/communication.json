          "authors": "Aaron Hyzen, Hilde Van den Bulck, Manuel Puppis, Michelle Kulig, Steve Paulussen",
          "abstract": "Working with the concept of epistemic welfare, defined as creating and maintaining the conditions and capabilities for individuals’ epistemic agency in the public sphere, this contribution provides a theoretical framework to demonstrate a way out of what has been described as an epistemic crisis, illustrating this with the case of algorithmic recommender systems used by media organizations. First, we identify the processes of datafication, algorithmization and platformization and their impact on the public sphere, specifically how they disrupt knowledge production, dissemination and acquisition. Next, we combine social epistemology, welfare studies and communication research to build a framework that allows analyzing how well communicative social practices, procedures and institutions fulfill epistemic standards and, thus, contribute to individuals’ opportunities to exercise their epistemic agency and reach epistemically valuable states. Finally, we discuss epistemic welfare’s implications for media governance, i.e., building conditions and capabilities that ensure epistemic agency.",

          "authors": "Anna Yan Liu, Alice Ji, Harsh Taneja, Michelle R. Nelson",
          "abstract": "As the media industry employs big data to imagine audiences, audiences simultaneously seek to understand how their digital traces are being converted into audience data to inform the industry. We explore how fans map stakeholders in the Chinese idol industry, perceive stakeholders’ utilization and construction of audience data, and use those perceptions to guide their data-driven practices. We conducted a netnography of INTO1’s fandoms as a case study, expanding upon studies of platform audience behaviors, fan labor, and imaginaries. Previous studies have shown that fans generate audience data to influence profit-driven stakeholders’ cultural production, such as showing the size and purchasing power of the fanbase to networks and advertisers to prevent TV shows from being canceled. In China’s profit-driven yet state-regulated idol industry, we found that beyond traditional profit-driven (talent management agencies, media organizations, advertisers) and market information (measurement companies) stakeholders, fans also identify the State as a regulatory stakeholder and platforms as emerging cross-sector stakeholders. Based on a grounded theory approach to data analysis, we coined the concept of audience data imaginaries, which we define as audiences’ perception of multiple stakeholders’ utilization and construction of audience data in a cultural industry. We show how fans align data-driven practices with different stakeholders’ interests, serving as desirable market segments, promotion workers, and good citizens. Highlighting how fans map and perceive multiple stakeholders’ engagement with audience data, this concept offers a productive framework applicable to analyze fans’ data-driven practices in other contexts.",

          "abstract": "This article explores the affective shift from horror to humour in Little Nightmares when transitioning from gameplay to stream viewing. Employing microethology, a methodology suitable for analysing shorter gaming experiences, this study scrutinises avatar death scenes as moments of affective transformation. It introduces the concept of ‘empathetic horror’, defined as the fear, distress, and nervousness that arises from players’ deep empathetic bond with their avatar through embodied and affective involvement in a game. Conceptualising the moment of death as an assemblage, this study examines how watching Danmaku game streams on Bilibili reframes this fear-inducing moment as humorous. It identifies three factors responsible for this transformation: a change in ludic engagement and the player’s perspective, altered meanings of critical actors within the assemblage (including monsters and death), and the introduction of new participants (such as Danmaku game streams) into the networked assemblage. This analysis underscores the role of Danmaku streams in creating a humorous environment, strengthening entertaining effects, and foregrounding the performative dimensions of play, providing insights into the evolving affective responses across gaming and streaming contexts.",

          "title": "Liminal right to the ‘coffee map’: Geomedia and the digital dilemma facing independent coffee houses in China",
          "authors": "Anqi Huang",
          "abstract": "The term ‘coffee map’ refers to the digital mapping of coffee houses within urban environments, collaboratively produced and circulated on digital platforms. Drawing the concept of the right to the city and recent theories in geomedia studies, this article critically examines how coffee maps mediate spatial power dynamics, visibility, and entrepreneurial subjectivity among independent coffee houses in urban China. Based on fieldwork conducted in Guangzhou, it argues that independent coffee businesses occupy a liminal position shaped simultaneously by opportunities for urban autonomy and constraints from algorithmic visibility regimes imposed by digital infrastructures such as Dianping, Meituan and Xiaohongshu. On one hand, geomedia affordances enable these businesses to craft their own urban narratives and assert agency in reshaping residential neighborhoods, exemplifying a grassroots form of gentrification. On the other hand, these platforms also impose significant constraints through data-driven governance, competitive rankings, and rapidly shifting policies, contributing to a condition of precarity and digital resignation. This dual role positions independent coffee houses in a constant negotiation of spatial agency, platform dependence, and structural marginalization. Under such context, rather than escaping digital constraints, it is also found that independent coffee houses strategically engage in recursive narratives of instability and performative liminality to remain relevant. Thus, the coffee map, as both a representation and an instrument of spatial governance, reveals the complex interplay between entrepreneurial aspirations, neoliberal urbanization, and platform-mediated urban participation, highlighting critical implications for contemporary understandings of geomedia and the right to the city.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores video game documentaries as a method for researching online gaming communities. We begin by framing documentary filmmaking as a practice-based approach, a creative form of video ethnography, with the film serving as the focal output. Our analysis draws on a close reading of four recent video game documentaries that highlight European voices, alongside insights from our own fieldwork. We focus on the affordances of this approach in capturing embodied, affective, and performative aspects of play that text-based ethnography may struggle to convey. The selected films also offer different stances on the agency of both participant-protagonists and researcher-director. In light of these observations, we propose a multimodal research output in which the documentary film takes center stage.",

          "abstract": "News aggregators inherently constitute choice architectures in which placement and presentation of news articles in the user interface affect how people perceive and engage with them. Accordingly, deliberate changes of a news aggregators’ choice architecture may nudge engagement. Against this background, our study aims to test the effects of 2 nudges, namely a position and an accessibility nudge, on (a) the selection of, (b) the engagement with, and (c) learning from environmental news articles by means of a 7-day field experiment using a news aggregator app in the United Kingdom. Results suggest that prominent article positioning coupled with visual highlighting significantly increases the selection of environmental news, its reading time and recall of information. In contrast, automated rewriting of environmental articles for lower text complexity had no significant effects. Additional analyses indicate that neither nudge backfired by decreasing user satisfaction, thus suggesting the practical usability of our approach.",

This study explores the self-uncertainty experienced by these mothers and investigates its connection to their identification with online maternal groups and adherence to group norms. Using national survey data from 639 South Korean mothers, this study, guided by Uncertainty-Identity Theory (UIT) and the Social Identity Model of Deindividuation (SIDE), sheds light on how these mothers often internalize intense group norms. Findings underscore the importance of considering mothers as members of a distinct social group (vs. individuals), enriching our understanding of motherhood dynamics. Both UIT and SIDE effectively explain these complex phenomena.",

          "authors": "Julian Pimienta",
          "abstract": "Abstract: Manga – Japanese comics – is a central pillar of Japanese culture and an expanding global phenomenon, yet little research has examined how individuals form and maintain meaningful connections with this medium. While previous studies conceptualized manga attachment as a multidimensional construct, no validated measures exist. This study refines and validates an existing set of manga attachment items, and introduces the Manga Attachment Scale (MAS), a psychometric tool assessing emotional, cognitive, and behavioral engagement with manga. Across three independent studies, the MAS was tested for factor structure, reliability, and validity. Study 1 ( N = 328) used Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to refine the original item set, resulting in a 14-item, four-factor structure: Safe Haven, Separation Distress, Secure Base, and Proximity Maintenance. Study 2 ( N = 588) confirmed this structure via Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), demonstrating strong model fit. Study 3 ( N = 511) evaluated predictive, construct, convergent, and discriminant validity, showing significant relationships between the MAS, reading frequency, and manga’s perceived importance, while distinguishing it from other manga engagement measures. The MAS provides a validated framework for assessing manga attachment, contributing to media attachment research and extending Attachment Theory. This tool facilitates future investigations into manga’s role in well-being, identity formation, and media engagement.",

          "abstract": "Having a pregnancy end without a live baby can result in mixed effects to the relationship with one’s living children, but this has mostly been examined in the first years after the loss. Research is needed to understand the implications for relationships in later life. Thus, the current study examined whether losing a pregnancy was associated with the relationship with one’s adult children. The study used data from the Survey of Health and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). It examined a sample of women aged 50+ who experienced stillbirth over their life and a comparison sample of women who didn’t experience stillbirth. Regression models were used to assess the association between experiencing stillbirth and the parent–child relationship. The results showed that women who lost a pregnancy reported more emotionally close relationships with their adult children. These results indicated that losing a pregnancy could have long-term implications on the relationship with one’s children in later life. These women might have been more likely to invest in the emotional bonds with their children.",

          "abstract": "People can foster social connection in new relationships through intimate conversation comprised of reciprocal self-disclosure and responsiveness, but the limited affordances of text-based communication may hinder this process. The present study examined the effectiveness of intimate conversation in promoting social connection during texting and in-person interactions. Two hundred and eighty-six unacquainted dyads ( N = 572) were randomly assigned to have an intimate or small talk conversation that occurred face-to-face or via text messaging on a smartphone. Afterward, participants reported how socially connected they felt to their conversational partner, including their self-disclosure, perceived partner responsiveness, and interpersonal closeness. Participants reported greater social connection after intimate (vs. small talk) and face-to-face (vs. texting) conversations, but the effect of intimate conversation did not differ across the two mediums. Exploratory mediation analyses revealed a serial indirect effect of conversation medium on social connection, such that texting (vs. face-to-face) interactions led to lower self-disclosure, which was then associated with lower perceived responsiveness and closeness. These findings suggest people can connect over texting through intimate conversation, but they may be less likely to self-disclose over texting than in face-to-face interactions, which can have downstream consequences for interpersonal closeness.",

Replicating previous work, political orientation was related to a preference for political similarity, such that women holding more extreme political views showed the strongest preferences for political similarity. In addition, women leaning more to the right side of the political spectrum held higher preferences for ethnic and religious similarity. Partly consistent with the possibility that political orientation relates to women’s attraction towards men conforming to a masculine, male breadwinner stereotype, more right-leaning views were not only linked to preferring a financially secure and successful partner, but also to ascribing more importance to a partner´s height. No or only negligible relationships with political orientation were found for partner´s kindness-supportiveness and level of height. For all other preferences, results were less conclusive. In sum, results indicate that who women want as a romantic partner is partly related to their political orientation.",

          "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that teacher-student relationship and peer attachment play an important role in the development of internalizing problem behaviors. However, little is known about the bidirectional linkages between teacher-student relationship and peer attachment and internalization problems in left-behind children’s groups and the underlying mechanisms of the dynamics. This study used cross-lagged panel modeling (CLPM) to explore the bidirectional longitudinal relationship between teacher-student relationship and peer attachment and internalization problems among left-behind children in China. A sample of 610 left-behind children completed a series of questionnaires at three time points (M age = 9.52, SD age = 0.79), with an approximate interval of 1 year between each time point. The results of cross-lagged analyses showed that (1) A supportive teacher-student relationship initiates a virtuous cycle by negatively predicting subsequent internalizing problem behaviors while enhancing peer attachment. (2) Conversely, internalizing problem behaviors initiate a vicious cycle, which in turn negatively predicts subsequent teacher-student relationship and peer attachment. These findings support the interaction model, suggesting that teachers should not only recognize how internalizing problem behaviors actively reinforces relational deficits (negative “driving” effects) but also strategically leverage the protective roles of the teacher-student relationship and peer attachment (positive “driving” effects).",

          "abstract": "Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have begun to influence almost all aspects of life, including romantic relationships. Despite many companies and other entities now utilizing AI technology to produce products and media that may influence romantic relationship engagement and behavior, few studies to date have attempted to document or describe the ways that individuals engage with multiple AI technologies for romantic or sexual purposes in large national samples. Using a large quota national sample taken from the United States of 2,969 adults, in this exploratory study we sought to examine engagement with AI technologies, specifically the use of image generation of men and women on social media, chat technologies meant to simulate romantic or sexual partners, and AI generated pornography. Results suggested that engagement with AI technologies is relatively high, especially among young adults in their 20’s, suggesting that these emerging technologies represent an element of modern sexual behavior and romantic relationships that warrant further attention. A sizable minority of young adults reported using AI technologies romantically or sexually, including almost one in four young adults engaging with AI chat technologies to replicate romantic interactions. Regression results suggested that various demographic factors predict engagement with AI technologies and that AI technology use was associated with negative individual well-being. These initial descriptive results suggest the need for further research on this emerging behavioral phenomenon as an important component of modern romantic and sexual interactions.",

          "abstract": "Despite previous studies documenting the existence of distinct attachment models that provide complementary information, there is a gap in research examining empirically attachment profiles that integrate both global attachment and attachment in specific domains from a person-centered approach. Based in the hierarchical structure of attachment representations, the present study evaluated the existence of different attachment profiles, using continuous scores of attachment anxiety and avoidance, in both global and romantic domains among 1,925 Chilean emerging adults. Additionally, and to assess the validity of these profiles, we investigated their association with mental health symptoms and relationship satisfaction. Through latent profile analysis (LPA), we identified five attachment profiles: and overall secure profile marked by security across both domains, one by insecurity across both domains (overall insecure), two profiles with elevated attachment anxiety (particularly in romantic domain) combined with moderate global avoidance, and a profile marked by high global attachment avoidance, and moderate romantic avoidance. The identified profiles were meaningfully associated with mental health symptoms and relationship satisfaction, supporting their validity. These results underscore the heterogeneity of internal working models in emerging adults, demonstrating that domain-specific divergence is common. They also highlight the added value of examining both global and romantic attachment to more fully capture the diversity of attachment experiences and relational functioning in this population. A pesar de que estudios previos han documentado la existencia de distintos modelos de apego que ofrecen información complementaria, existe una brecha en la investigación que examine empíricamente perfiles de apego que integren tanto el apego global como el apego en dominios específicos desde un enfoque centrado en la persona. Basándose en la estructura jerárquica de las representaciones de apego, el presente estudio evaluó la existencia de diferentes perfiles de apego, utilizando puntuaciones continuas de ansiedad y evitación en el apego, tanto en los dominios global como romántico, en una muestra de 1.925 adultos emergentes chilenos. Además, y con el fin de evaluar la validez de estos perfiles, investigamos su asociación con síntomas de salud mental y satisfacción en la relación de pareja. A través de un análisis de perfiles latentes (LPA, por sus siglas en inglés), identificamos cinco perfiles de apego: un perfil globalmente seguro caracterizado por seguridad en ambos dominios; uno por inseguridad en ambos dominios (globalmente inseguro); dos perfiles con ansiedad elevada en el apego (particularmente en el dominio romántico) combinada con evitación global moderada; y un perfil caracterizado por alta evitación global en el apego y evitación romántica moderada. Los perfiles identificados se asociaron de manera significativa con síntomas de salud mental y satisfacción en la relación, respaldando su validez. Estos resultados subrayan la heterogeneidad de los modelos operativos internos en adultos emergentes, demostrando que la divergencia específica por dominio es común. Asimismo, destacan el valor añadido de examinar tanto el apego global como el romántico para captar más plenamente la diversidad de experiencias de apego y el funcionamiento relacional en esta población.",

          "abstract": "Political polarization is driving disconnection and animosity between opponents in the United States. We propose perceiving opponents as self-disclosing helps foster connection and reduce animosity. Building on research demonstrating that self-disclosure fosters interpersonal relationships, we test whether vignettes expressing political views that seem self-disclosing increase connection, respect, and willingness to interact among opponents. Across six studies, we demonstrate self-disclosure reduces partisan animosity by building connection between political opponents. Previous work shows that vignettes about opponents’ personal experiences bridge divides better than fact-based vignettes. The results from the current research suggest this is because experiences are especially self-disclosing. Leveraging this, we find that many statements partisans share can improve connection and reduce animosity when they are perceived as self-disclosing. We test this through manipulating the self-disclosure of statements in experiments and by teaching people how to make their statements more self-disclosing. Results indicate self-disclosure is consistently effective for liberal and moderate partisans but in many cases are also effective for conservatives. By highlighting the power of self-disclosure, our findings offer a promising path toward bridging partisan divides.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the relation between news consumption and fostering public deliberation within democratic systems. Drawing on Jürgen Habermas’s concepts of understanding orientation (consensus-oriented, communicative rationality) and strategic orientation (goal-oriented, instrumental rationality), it explores how news media can either facilitate rational communication in public debates or, alternatively, encourage strategic interventions. To investigate these relationships, this study utilizes a survey in Chile (&lt;em&gt;N = &lt;/em&gt;903) conducted under the supervision of the Millennium Nucleus for the Study of Politics, Public Opinion, and Media (Nucleo MEPOP) between August and September 2022. The findings reveal that traditional media and social media are significantly and positively associated with a strategic orientation, whereas exposure to digital media is negatively associated with such an orientation. Additionally, incidental exposure emerges as a key factor in shaping the relationship between media consumption and deliberative predispositions. This article contributes to the understanding of classical approaches to the study of deliberation in the digital contemporary context, where homophily, polarization, and confrontation have emerged as significant challenges for both developing and established democracies.",

          "abstract": "An established body of research demonstrates that political talk shapes political participation. However, less is known about how an individual’s ease of listening interacts with conversational contexts to influence participation. This study hypothesizes that this listening disposition amplifies the effect of political talk on political participation. Using data from a 2024 US national survey (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 800), we test this using OLS regression on a composite index of political participation. The model assesses how the frequency of political talk across four contexts (strong/weak ties network, and like-minded/different-minded people) is moderated by self-reported ease of listening (to like- and different-minded people). Results show that while talking and listening to like-minded people is positively associated with participation, the main effect for talking and listening to different-minded people is not significant. However, a significant interaction emerges: The positive effect of talking with different-minded people on participation is amplified by the ease of listening to those same views. This effect is confined to cross-cutting conversations; no comparable interactions were found in strong-tie, weak-tie, or like-minded contexts. These findings indicate that the civic benefit of listening is highly contextual, with the ease of listening to differing views unlocking the participatory potential of talk during cross-cutting discussion.",

          "authors": "Dario Siegen, Daniel Vogler",
          "abstract": "Despite broad scientific support, vaccination is traditionally a contested issue among the public. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the issue of vaccination received widespread attention in news media and on social media. Although we know that public debates on such disputed issues evolve over time in hybrid media systems, there is still little knowledge about the extent to which news media and social media align or differ in their issue attention dynamics and semantics. Furthermore, empirical studies, particularly on social media data, tend to focus on periods of high issue attention, often missing relevant reference points before or after such phases. Focusing on the issue of vaccination in Switzerland, we examine 77,798 news articles by 20 Swiss online newspapers and 929,431 posts by 22,672 Swiss Twitter (now X) users to investigate the similarities and differences between the two spheres through a time series analysis between April 1, 2019, and June 30, 2022. The findings show how vaccination gained vastly in issue attention—measured as the share of total coverage and tweet volume, respectively—during the Covid-19 pandemic. Twitter and news media were closely aligned during the crisis in terms of issue attention and semantics, but less so before and after the pandemic. These findings substantiate previous works on issue agendas in hybrid media systems that converge toward a dominant issue in times of crisis.",

          "abstract": "The 2024 European Parliament elections took place against a backdrop of overlapping crises, including climate change, migration, and the Russian war against Ukraine, all of which have the potential to drive political polarization. These wedge issues can be strategically used in campaign communication to activate strong emotional and moral responses, exploit societal divisions, and fracture opposing coalitions. When combined with populist communication and illiberal rhetoric, they align closely with the attention dynamics of social media but also carry potential dangers for democratic discourse. However, research on how these elements are combined in parties’ campaign communication remains limited. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive manual quantitative content analysis of 8,748 Facebook posts from parties in 13 EU member states, examining how wedge issues were communicated and combined with populism and illiberalism during the 2024 European Parliament elections. Our analyses reveal that populist parties relied more heavily on wedge issues and combined them with populist communication and illiberal rhetoric more often than non-populist parties. Certain wedge issues appeared more conducive to these elements than others. The combination of wedge issues with populist communication and illiberal rhetoric as exclusionary rhetorical strategies thus emerges as a defining feature of populist digital campaigning. These elements can be seen as mutually reinforcing tools that structure harmful political interpretation patterns, particularly in times of polycrises. This underscores how digital platforms can be used to redefine the contours of democratic debate, making it even more essential to understand the communicative mechanisms through which parties influence public discourse in order to defend democracy.",

          "authors": "Simone Carlo, Francesco Diodati",
          "abstract": "Smartphones are widely considered a more suitable tool for those who have recently come to the digital world, such as older people. Many scholars and experts promote the spread of mobile services among the older population in order to enhance the maintenance of independence and autonomy in late age. However, few qualitative studies have thoroughly investigated older adults’ tactical use of smartphones, especially in the postpandemic context of digital acceleration. This paper investigates the tactical use of mobile services among 40 individuals, both male and female, aged 65 to 80 in Lodi, Italy, the first COVID-19 “Red Zone” in Europe. The study seeks to examine how mobile phone narratives in postpandemic settings reflect cultural models of active ageing; the dynamics of resistance, rejection, and adaptation regarding older individuals’ engagement with digital services; and the influence of social relationships in facilitating local access to predominantly digital and mobile-first public services. We argue that a tactical nonuse of mobile services emerges in narratives that, instead of reproducing a linear and homogeneous understanding of active ageing, challenge a binary opposition between users and nonusers of information and computer technologies (ICTs) in late age.",

          "abstract": "Despite TikTok’s extensive popularity among children below the age of 12, there remains a significant gap in our understanding of how they use this platform for social purposes. We therefore ask how children between the ages of 8 and 12 shape their peer relations through their uses of TikTok. Through longitudinal observations of children ( n = 84) in the context of afterschool care, we found that children use TikTok to develop and employ digital, cultural and social practices. Examples of such practices are referencing popular content to connect with weak tied peers, managing their online presence to prevent scrutinization in offline social contexts and using humoristic trends and knowledge of TikTok to achieve social status and popularity. Employing these practices across on- and offline spaces can support and facilitate their development of social capital. Following these findings, we argue for initiatives and methodologies that support and explore children’s social and digital development.",

          "abstract": "Recent scholarship in critical algorithm studies has illuminated how users negotiate and resist algorithmic influence in everyday platform use, yet these perspectives remain underexplored in online consumption. Bridging theoretical frameworks of consumer culture and critical algorithm studies, this study examines the complexities of algorithmic consumer culture and practices through qualitative research on users’ experiences with Temu. We introduce the concept of platform cynicism —an ambivalent and negotiated user attitude in which skepticism, mistrust, and criticism of platforms’ exploitative, manipulative, or unethical practices coexist with pragmatic, often reluctant engagement and tactical adaptation due to structural, social, economic, or cultural constraints. Platform cynicism manifests across five interconnected dimensions: cognitive awareness, affective disillusionment, pragmatic resignation, tactical adaptation, and user–platform co-constitution. This concept can extend beyond e-commerce to broader user-platform relationships, offering insights into how consumers adapt to, contest, and remain embedded in platform capitalism despite critical awareness of their manipulative nature.",

          "abstract": "Bina48 is the most ambitious manifestation of thanatechnologies, AI systems that digitally resurrect deceased individuals. Online platforms harvest and assemble data, photos, and personal digital effects to reanimate the individual via AI and reap the profits that come from their ongoing interactions with living users. The profiles of deceased individuals are directly owned and mobilized by the platform itself. Building on digital labor scholarship that shows how platforms extract value from living users, thanatechnologies represent a new kind of post-life laborer in the online economy, transforming grief and memory into exchange-value through emotional labor, social maintenance, and content generation. The specter of the zombie highlights how this digital labor intersects with histories of racial and gendered exploitation, particularly visible in the case of Bina48, where a black woman’s identity becomes a site of technological performance and commodification. Post-life laborers reveal contemporary understandings of labor, productivity, and the ongoing commodification of personal identity, affect, and sociality.",

          "abstract": "Networked counterpublics have emerged on social media, articulating their lived experiences and collectively countering narratives propagated by mainstream publics. However, the voices of minority publics on social media can also be sanctioned by mainstream publics and institutions. Drawing upon the concept of sanctions within counterpublics literature, this study proposes a theoretically based framework that helps us understand the strategies, comprising attack, appropriation, and dismissal, through which discourses, movements, and performances of networked counterpublics are undermined. Each of these discursive strategies is operated by key actors and manifests itself directly and indirectly to undermine minority discourse on social media and beyond. In sum, this article presents a conceptual framework of networked counterpublics sanctions and illustrates how the actors, the direct and indirect manifestations, and the strategies in the contemporary media environment serve as sanctions to networked counterpublics.",

          "abstract": "We posit that research into misinformation interventions puts too much focus on informational outcomes (e.g. perceived accuracy of misinformation), and too little on persuasive outcomes (e.g. inferred beliefs, attitudes, intentions, and behaviors). Because of the informational outcome focus, common misinformation interventions (i.e. forewarning and debunking) have not been systematically tested for their ability to mitigate persuasive effects. In two preregistered experiments ( N = 657 and N = 427), we tested the effectiveness of forewarning versus debunking for positive and negative misinformation, focusing on attitudes and behavioral intentions as outcome measures. Results show that, as hypothesized, post-exposure corrections are most effective in reducing misinformation’s persuasive effects; pre-exposure corrections in fact do not significantly reduce persuasive effects. We also corroborate prior findings that especially effects of negative misinformation are resistant to corrections. Based on our results, we advise media outlets to not only rely on forewarnings, but to also correct misinformation after user exposure.",

          "authors": "Michele Zappavigna",
          "abstract": "This article explores how Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots regulate moral values when they refuse ‘unsafe’ requests from users. It applies corpus-based discourse analysis to examine how the chatbots employ tenor resources of positioning , tuning , and orienting in the rhetoric of their refusals. This method is informed by Systemic Functional Linguistics, in particular the discourse semantic system of appraisal , which models evaluative meaning. Despite their contrite openings, chatbot refusals tend to raise stakes in terms of tenor. They deploy prosodies of propriety targeted at moral and taboo stances and behaviours. This rhetoric of oppositioning involves encapsulating key values into iconised attitudes as the chatbots advise users about what is ‘important’ and ‘not appropriate’.",

          "authors": "Siyun Peng",
          "abstract": "In 2023, the US Surgeon General declared an “epidemic of loneliness and isolation.” This study asks: (RQ1) Where do daily social connections come from? (RQ2) Can people find alternative sources of social connection when access from a location is unavailable? Using 10 years of data from the American Time Use Survey, I find that the home is the largest source of social connections in daily life, followed by the workplace and third places. More importantly, when people lack daily social connections at home (i.e., living alone), they have 3.8 h/day fewer connections than people who do not live alone. In contrast, when people lack daily social connections at work (i.e., through unemployment or retirement), they have 1.3 h/day fewer connections than employed people. This significant difference in effect size is explained by the compensation patterns of people lacking daily social connections at home vs. at work. Specifically, people who lack daily social connections at work can compensate for their loss by getting connections from home and third places, whereas people who live alone are not able or willing to find alternative sources of daily social connections from work or third places, highlighting the need to address social isolation at home.",

          "abstract": "The goal of the current study was to explore the role of relationship clarity—the extent to which someone understands what they want in a relationship—in single young adults' dating experiences. We hypothesized that for single individuals who are actively dating, lacking clearly defined dating goals may lead to greater loneliness and, in turn, account for decreased life satisfaction. We first validated the Relationship Clarity Scale (RCS) using data from both Studies 1 and 2 ( N = 375). Across two studies, we then examined single young adults' dating experiences and reports of relationship clarity cross‐sectionally (Study 1: N = 191) and longitudinally (Study 2: N = 184). Findings revealed that for single young adults who were actively dating, lower relationship clarity (i.e., not knowing what one is looking for in a romantic relationship) predicted increased loneliness over time, and this loneliness accounted for decreased life satisfaction. These findings offer insight into how the clarity of romantic goals during early dating stages may be important for single people's well‐being and, ultimately, for life satisfaction.",

          "abstract": "Scholars have increasingly turned to empathy to increase the effectiveness of participatory deliberations among individuals with diverse interests and values. However, because empathy is traditionally focused on in-group relations, deliberations in increasingly polarized contexts would benefit from ways to bridge across social groups. To address this, we apply the construct of social empathy. Our study explores social empathy through participatory technology assessment forums and asks: how do we incorporate, measure, and understand social empathy in public deliberations on human genome editing technology? The analysis reveals that by considering social empathy, participatory deliberation forum designers can use “persona” character cards and other forum infrastructure to increase the effectiveness of deliberation across social groups among individuals with diverse interests and values. For future deliberations seeking to cultivate social learning, social empathy—when designed for, integrated in, and measured through deliberations—presents an important mechanism for attention.",

          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic not only posed unprecedented threats to public health and economic stability but also triggered a crisis of information, described by the World Health Organization as an “infodemic.” Against this backdrop, this study explores the dynamics of COVID-19 misperceptions through the lens of Appraisal Theory and the Reinforcing Spirals Model, examining how perceived threats and media exposure shaped belief updating and reinforcement over time. Drawing on a two-year panel survey conducted in Austria (April 2020 to March 2022), we use a mixed Markov chain model to analyze one of the most persistent and widely believed conspiracy narratives—the claim that COVID-19 was a deliberately engineered bioweapon. The results reveal two opposing types of belief trajectories: an upward trajectory of belief stability, reinforcement of accurate beliefs, and correction, driven by perceived health-related threats and exposure to high-quality media, such as public broadcasters and broadsheets; and a downward trajectory marked by heightened belief instability, reinforcement of misperceptions, and an erosion of belief accuracy, associated with perceived economic threats and the use of low-quality media—including tabloids, commercial TV, and social media. Overall, the findings highlight the value of the theoretical frameworks for a more nuanced understanding of belief dynamics in times of crisis and underline the vital role of high-quality media in fostering a well-informed democratic public.",
