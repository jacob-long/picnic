          "authors": "Stine Lomborg, Lisa Marie Reutter, Giovanna Nunez Vilaza",
          "abstract": "This paper addresses data reflexivity in terms of critical consciousness-raising by linking people’s everyday encounters with data to their speculative visions about datafied futures. We suggest everyday encounters with data about oneself might play an important role in facilitating both personal and collective imagination about data and devising future paths towards legitimate and meaningful datafied living. Lending inspiration from the figure of the researcher as critical companion and from speculative design, we posit that critical consciousness-raising is not something generated purely by way of informing people about datafication, but built from below, through people’s everyday experiences with datafying themselves and being datafied by others. Furthermore, it is deeply intertwined with datafication research itself, and the way we seek to establish links between individual and collective experiences and evaluations of data practices. Based on this, the paper offers three methodological entry points for exploring how critical consciousness can be cultivated and collectivized: longitudinal fieldwork with repeated interviews, data visualization derived from people’s own phones, and speculative workshops on future data practices.",

          "abstract": "This study explores  Fursan al-Aqsa: The Knights of the Al-Aqsa Mosque (developed by Nidal Nijm Games in 2022) highlighting its role in the portrayal of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a paradigm between propaganda and entertainment. By examining the game’s discourse, and its impact on player perceptions, this research sheds light on how video games can shape understanding and engagement with geopolitical issues. The research utilises Albert Bandura’s concept of moral disengagement to analyse the game’s content and its reception on platforms like Twitch and YouTube. By assessing how the game frames moral considerations through its narrative and gameplay, this study reveals the potential of digital games to affect player perceptions and contribute to the broader media landscape surrounding political issues. The analysis also explores the reception and re-interpretation of the game by players and content creators, thus offering insights into the complex interplay between video game content, ideological influence, and audience engagement.",

          "authors": "Marta Rodríguez-Castro, Azahara Cañedo, Mónica López-Golán",
          "abstract": "Amidst a global media landscape dominated by transnational conglomerates and tech giants, proximity media face the imperative to reassess their mission and relevance. As market dynamics may lead to news deserts, proximity public service media (PSM) are crucial in catering to underserved audiences with news and entertainment tailored to their nearby environment. This paper draws on insights from seven focus groups involving stakeholders of Radiotelevisión del Principado de Asturias (RTPA), a proximity PSM outlet in northern Spain, to delve into the perspectives of audiences, production companies and advertisers on RTPA's proximity focus and informational role. The findings reveal widespread appreciation for proximity among RTPA's stakeholders, delineated into three dimensions: physical, emotional and economic. Moreover, the expectations on and assessments of RTPA's informational role are rooted in general PSM values such as impartiality, quality and participation. It is concluded that there is a need to explore the values of PSM beyond normative approaches and including the insights of stakeholders, and that proximity PSM outlets must dynamically adapt their values to meet the unique needs of proximity communities.",

          "abstract": "Information as a public good is not a thing of nature, but a purposeful action. In my contribution, I explore an international association that got institutionalised around the idea of information as a public good by means of lucrative cooperation between public service broadcasters. It emerged after the Second World War, in a world where public services would become the norm rather than the exception, and has continued to a time when priorities switched fundamentally towards profit and liberalisation. The object of study is the European Broadcasting Union, the largest association of public service media providers in Europe and beyond, servicing more than one billion people as audiences via its members. In order to understand whether EBU's institutional practices still prioritise information as a public good or have moved towards a more neo-lib focus, I undertook an institutional analysis based on secondary data. The research shows that the combination of a neo-lib corporate layer with voluntary working groups from national PSMs makes EBU particularly successful; it looks like a new public management dream come true, except that EBU is not an accountable public organisation. Through the NGO structure, corporate management and voluntary work, it opens large avenues of cooperation for professionals to innovate together, at the end of the day enhancing information as a public good.",

          "authors": "Xiang Gong, Yi Yang, Wei Wu",
          "abstract": "Purpose Social group system and social tagging system, which leverage the psychological mechanisms underlying group influence and social tags to drive consumer behaviors, have been prevalent in the social commerce platform. However, limited studies have examined how the affordances of social group system and social tagging system influence consumers’ social shopping behavior. The purpose of this study is to examine the formation of social shopping behavior in the social commerce platform. Design/methodology/approach Combining affordance theory with dual-congruity theory, we develop a model to examine how the affordances of social group system and social tagging system influence consumers’ social shopping behavior through the underlying self-congruity and functional-congruity processes. We empirically validate the research model using a multimethod approach, including an instrument development study and a field survey study. Findings Our empirical findings show that social support positively influences relational identity, while it has a nonsignificant effect on social identity. Social interactivity positively influences relational identity and social identity. Furthermore, social tagging quality and social endorser credibility positively affect perceived diagnosticity and perceived serendipity. Finally, relational identity, social identity, perceived diagnosticity and perceived serendipity collectively determine consumers’ social shopping intention. Originality/value This study contributes to the theoretical understanding of social shopping in social commerce and offers practical implications for designing an effective social group system and social tagging system to boost product sales.",

          "authors": "Xiaodan Liu, Chao Su, Jin Yin",
          "abstract": "Purpose Social networking services (SNS) empower users with a robust capability to connect with others and manage their social relationships. However, as the size of users’ social networks increases, coupled with the inherent boundary-spanning technical features of SNS, users are faced with unprecedented role stresses. This, in turn, leads to maladaptive lurking decisions. This study delves into the mechanism of this technology-induced decision-making process among SNS users. Design/methodology/approach Survey data were collected from 491 Chinese WeChat Moment users. The model and hypotheses testing were conducted using SmartPLS 4.0. Findings Our findings indicate that both social network size and boundary spanning have a positive influence on role conflict and role overload. Both role conflict and role overload significantly contribute to SNS fatigue, which further intensifies users’ lurking intention. Furthermore, SNS fatigue fully mediated the relationship between role conflict and lurking intention, and partially mediated the relationship between role overload and lurking intention. Originality/value Our study offers a fresh viewpoint for comprehending lurking behaviors on SNS, furnishing practical insights for platform providers. Additionally, it paves the way for future research into the deeper mechanisms driving SNS lurking behaviors, by providing a novel construct (i.e. boundary spanning) to distinguish and measure the unique social environment of SNS.",

          "authors": "Samantha Samaneh Kakavand, Aria Teimourzadeh, Benjamin Kakavand",
          "abstract": "Purpose Grounded in coping model of user adaptation (CMUA), this research aims to provide insights into understanding the social mechanism influencing faculty’s adoption and adaptation of mobile technology (MT). An extensive review of the literature highlights a significant gap in empirical research regarding the adoption of MT and faculty adaptation when viewed through the lens of group dynamics. Design/methodology/approach This study is based on an exploratory study conducted at two engineering universities in France. A qualitative method enabled a comprehensive examination of faculty members using multiple field-based observations and semi-directive interviews at both University A and University B. Findings While extant research tends to prioritize individual-level approaches, the integration of MT within higher education inherently involves social dynamics. Our results reveal that faculty’s perceived control and their initial perception over adoption of MT play an important role in shaping their adaptation behavior. The findings suggest that the adoption of MT among faculty members is influenced by various organizational factors. Specifically, the organizational logic of adoption affects their primary appraisal of MT, while group norms and social influence shape their adaptation acts. Furthermore, the organization’s continuous commitment to supporting faculty members also impacts their coping activities, ultimately influencing their overall adoption and utilization of MT. Originality/value This study builds upon the limited yet growing body of literature on a theme highly relevant for practitioners, scholars as well as MT users in a higher education environment. The paper extends the CMUA by exploring the relationship between MT adoption and continuous user adaptation at both group and organizational levels. Our proposed framework assists universities in articulating their MT adoption and implementation strategy in harmony with a clear vision of their users’ adaptation activities before, during and after the implementation.",

          "authors": "Baiqi Li, Yunya Song, Yongren Shi, Hsuan-Ting Chen",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study seeks to establish a new framework for categorizing incivility, differentiating between explicit and implicit forms, and to investigate their respective abilities to proliferate and mobilize conversations, along with behavioral outcomes in various social contexts. Design/methodology/approach Employing computational techniques, this research analyzed 10,145 protest-related threads from the HK Golden Forum, a prominent online discussion board in Hong Kong. Findings Our analysis revealed divergent effects of explicit and implicit incivility on their diffusion, influences on deliberative discussions, and user participation. Explicit incivility was found to impede deliberative conversations, while implicit incivility tended to provoke more responses. Explicit uncivil expressions encouraged the propagation of incivility but reduced the likelihood of individual involvement. In contrast, implicit incivility had a stronger dampening effect on further uncivil comments and achieved greater thread popularity. The results showed strong associations between uncivil expressions and the contextual norms surrounding social movements. Originality/value Theoretically, this research introduced a classification of incivility and underscored the importance of differentiating between implicit and explicit incivility by examining their effects on deliberation and engagement. Although previous studies have extensively covered explicit incivility, this study goes further by analyzing implicit incivility and comparing both forms of uncivil discourse in a less-studied context. Methodologically, the study developed a Cantonese dictionary to differentiate between two types of incivility, providing a practical reference for more nuanced analyses. By revealing how varying movement norms moderate the interplay between deliberative and uncivil expressions, the study drew attention to the highly situational nature of incivility.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This research focuses on analyzing the impact of digital transformation (DT) on the green innovation performance of Spanish wineries, as well as the mediating effect of green knowledge sharing (GKS) on this main relationship, as well as the moderating role of top management environmental awareness (TMEA) on the GKS-green innovation performance linkage. In addition, age, size and protected designation of origin (PDO) membership are used to increase the precision of the cause–effect relationships examined. Design/methodology/approach The study proposes a conceptual model based on previous studies, which is tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling, with data collected from 196 Spanish wineries between September 2022 and January 2023. Findings The results of the research reveal the existence of a positive and significant relationship between the development of DT and green innovation performance of Spanish wineries, as well as the partial mediation of GKS in this link and a positive moderation of TMEA in the GKS-green innovation performance bond. Practical implications Winery executives should prioritize aligning DT with TMEA to drive green innovation performance. Additionally, it is recommended that they actively promote GKS within their wineries to enhance sustainability performance and strengthen their competitive positioning in an eco-conscious market. Originality/value The originality of the study derives from its pioneering character, as the research enters unexplored terrain by investigating the role of the GKS as a mediator in the relationship between DT and green innovation performance, as no previous research has ventured in this direction.",

          "abstract": "In this article, we review Alice Marwick’s book, The Private is Political: Networked Privacy and Social Media, published by Yale University Press in 2023. In the book, Marwick argues that the digital nature of the social media landscape fundamentally changes contemporary notions of privacy. We trace three specific elements of her argument, namely: (1) the design of networked technologies to connect and leak, (2) the subsequent differential harms on those historically marginalized, and (3) the need to shift from individualized to more contextual and structural understandings of privacy. We discuss the implications of these arguments not just for privacy, but for expression. We describe the tensions around freedom of expressions and content moderation online. Finally, we conclude with a reflection on these arguments for academic expression given the socio-technological context in which we work and the differential harms that impact academics from historically marginalized communities. Building on Marwick’s arguments, we call for a social, contextual, and structural approach for responding to the targeted harassment of academics to protect and ensure academic freedom for all.",

          "abstract": "While numerous studies have documented an association between mainstream media trust and mainstream media use, only little is known about potential causal mechanisms underlying the association. We theorize that selective exposure, social influence, and the reinforcing spirals model offer three possible mechanisms that may underlie the association. These possibilities were studied using random intercept cross-lagged panel models and latent curve models on a four-wave panel data set (n = 3,540). For mainstream media, the results show an asymmetrical reinforcing spiral, in which the effect of mainstream media trust on use can be considered as one of yielding maintenance, while the impact of media use on mainstream media trust to a limited degree is in line with the notion of a spiral gradually (though inconsistently) increasing trust over time. We also find that use of right-wing alternative media consistently and sometimes robustly leads to decreasing mainstream media trust.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how the content and style of narrative writing about an outgroup reduce prejudice. The study compares cooperative contact, where writers describe working with an outgroup character, with parasocial contact, where writers describe the character alone. It further examines whether the contact effects vary with linguistic authenticity. In two experiments, I manipulated the types of contact and measured authenticity through language patterns. Study 1 ( N = 719) found that having contact with an outgroup character elicited more positive affect toward the character, which reduced the desire for distance from the outgroup. Cooperative and parasocial contact showed similar effects, but their impacts varied with linguistic authenticity. Authentic language was associated with stronger impacts in cooperative contact but not in parasocial contact. Study 2 ( N = 287) replicated that linguistic authenticity moderated the effect of cooperative contact on affect toward the character. These findings highlight linguistic dynamics in intergroup contact.",

This research investigated how the use of the Swedish gender-inclusive neopronoun hen influenced the gender categorization of faces beyond the binary. In a between-subjects design, participants ( N = 368) were instructed to use the gender-inclusive neopronoun hen, the binary masculine pronoun han (he), or no pronoun in a writing task. Then, they categorized androgynous morphed faces by selecting one of four response options (“woman,” “man,” “nonbinary,” or “I don't know”). Altogether, the results indicated that few participants responded “I don't know,” indicating that categorizing gender by appearance is common. As expected, the use of the gender-inclusive pronoun increased nonbinary categorizations, whereas the use of the masculine pronoun did not increase man categorizations, documenting that gender-inclusive pronouns increase the visibility of nonbinary people. Gender binary beliefs were associated with less nonbinary categorization. The discussion outlines how these findings can inform social policymaking.",

Though the influence of partisan identity on this processing is well established, much less is known about the role of preexisting climate beliefs. Furthermore, scholars have recently raised the possibility that what appear to be partisan effects on message judgments may simply be byproducts of accuracy-driven differences in perceived source credibility. Three online experiments revealed evidence that speaks to these conversations. The results show that message source, political affiliation, and preexisting climate beliefs combine nonadditively to affect persuasion. Furthermore, their effects are mediated by perceived source credibility. However, the evidence also suggests that this pattern emerged not because accuracy goals drive different perceptions of credibility but because credibility judgments are equally susceptible to directional motivated reasoning.",

          "abstract": "How does one’s connectedness in their social relationships affect their health? For a long time, this question has piqued the interest of sociologists. From Durkheim’s theory of suicide to recent empirical studies in medical sociology, the positive association between social integration and well-being has been well established. In this paper, we revisited this topic by focusing on how different sources of social contact is associated with self-rated health in Turkey. To do so, we examined how contact with a close friend, a parent, a sibling, and other family member – outside of one’s nuclear family – compares in terms of their association with self-rated health by using ISSP Social Network Data. We found that frequency of contact with a parent and other family member showed statistically significant and positive associations with self-rated health in some models, which was not the case for a sibling. In the full model accounting for all contact variables, however, only the frequency of contact with a close friend had a statistically significant and positive association with self-rated health. This study aims to start a discussion about the growing importance of non-kin ties in people’s lives in Turkey despite the increasing familialism in Turkish politics and social policymaking. Policymakers and social workers tackling issues such as social isolation, social exclusion, and loneliness in Turkey should consider the prevalence of non-kin networks on individuals’ well-being.",

          "abstract": "Young adults engage in digital dating abuse (DDA), or threatening, monitoring, and controlling behavior towards a romantic partner through technology. Alcohol use and jealousy are well-established risk factors for in-person partner abuse but have not yet been investigated in couples in the context of DDA. Jealousy might be a relevant moderator in the digital context, potentially amplifying the negative associations between problematic alcohol use and DDA. Thus, we examine dyadic associations between young adults’ problematic alcohol use and DDA perpetration, with romantic jealousy as a moderator. Participants are young adult heterosexual couples ( N = 91 couples, M age = 21.03 years, 54.4% White, 19.2% Latino, 26.3% other). Results from actor-partner interdependence models suggest that men’s jealousy significantly moderates both the actor effect for men and the partner effect for women. In contrast, women’s jealousy significantly moderates the partner effects for both men and women. Men’s problematic alcohol use is a risk factor for their own DDA perpetration at high levels of jealousy and is a risk factor for their partner’s DDA perpetration across their own or their partner’s jealousy. Women’s problematic alcohol use is a risk factor for their partner’s DDA perpetration across levels of their jealousy. These findings underscore the importance of considering individual and relational factors in understanding DDA. The study highlights the need for dyadic interventions targeting problematic alcohol use and jealousy to prevent DDA. Future research should utilize longitudinal designs and diary studies to investigate in-the-moment processes and within-person variability.",

This critical reflection adopts a “research through design” process to examine AR’s technological and affective capabilities in the context of three community co-created AR campaigns. We discuss how AR can become both a conceptual and practical tool for creating conditions of self-identification and, potentially, empathy between audience and content. Further, we explore how people and place become a critical part of AR’s infrastructure through the practice of empathic feedback loops.",

          "abstract": "Journalists are increasingly experiencing the negative consequences of online news transformations, such as trolling and harassment, as well as audience distrust. Despite acute need, intra-organisational efforts to support journalists’ online wellbeing have so far been limited. More recently, research has explored how journalists have turned to individual practices of disconnection, such as blocking, muting, or small breaks from online media to mediate the impacts of their everyday online labour (Bossio et al., 2024). Building on this research, this study explores how these individual practices are moving toward collective practices of disconnection. Using interviews with 21 journalists, this study traces how emergent collective practices might contribute to systemic change in journalism. We argue that in lieu of intra-organizational support, journalists seek to disconnect through informal sharing of experiences and support as well as collective efforts toward inter-organisational training and intra-organisational formalization mentoring programs.",

The research also integrates Hartmut Rosa’s theory of resonance with the digital media environment: It suggests that while Rosa may reject digital technology in his view of resonance, digital technology, or YouTube in this case, can contribute to enhancing resonance, but only depending on how people practice it. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the importance of middle-aged women, who are not merely viewers, but rather active participants within the burgeoning YouTube scene. Lastly, we expand the current understanding of how audience groups may potentially exert agency, moving beyond the ideological binaries of submission versus resistance in the process of interpreting media texts. Our emphasis lies in the creativity embedded in Korean middle-aged women’s platform practices within their daily lives. This process is fuelled by a deep desire and will to find resonance with themselves, others, and the world.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the phenomenon of ghosting on the mobile dating app Tinder among Slovenia’s dating app users. Ghosting is defined as the unexpected unilateral termination of communication in interpersonal relationships exerted through digital platforms. Drawing upon data from the walkthrough of the mobile dating app Tinder and 26 semi-structured interviews with users living in Ljubljana (Slovenia), ghosting is conceptualized as an undesirable but normalized disconnection strategy on Tinder. We argue that choosing ghosting as a communication strategy emerges predominantly from two different contexts. Firstly, from the need to protect oneself from harassment and vulnerability, and secondly, as a reaction to the information overload in an environment that demands perpetual activity, availability, and interaction. Therefore, it manifests as a disconnection strategy on an interaction level or as a consequence of disconnecting from the platform itself. According to users, the desire to disconnect from others and exit the app is as high and ambiguous as the desire to connect and experience an ego boost or the excitement of interactions. Ghosting on Tinder, therefore, emerges as a response to general hyperconnectivity to navigate the increasing information overload and to a feeling of loss of the possibilities for safe and authentic connections in digital spaces.",

          "abstract": "While digital media can be seen to keep alive social connections among migrants across borders, the impact of how digital disconnection has redrawn migrants’ boundaries has not been adequately researched. Migrants subjected to the dual border-and-boundary work of Western host countries and their non-Western home countries make for complicated self–other boundary narratives. This study explores the everyday boundary work of migrants originating from Hong Kong, a former British colony, who have chosen to relocate to the UK through the British National (Overseas) (BN[O]) visa scheme. The scheme was catalysed by the 2019 political upheaval in Chinese Hong Kong and the UK–Hong Kong colonial affiliation. Through the lens of dis/connection assemblage, we conceptualise digital dis/connections as a form of boundary work and conduct in-depth interviews and thematic analysis of 14 BN(O)s. We demonstrate that digital disconnection can be seen as a socio-political practice related to identity regulation by situating BN(O)s’ digital media practices within the political projects of belonging in the UK, Hong Kong, and China. Through a matrix of disconnected approaches, BN(O)s shape boundaries around identity politics in terms of social positions, a sense of belonging, and social relations. The political meaning of digital disconnection is highlighted through its fracture of connected space-time and resilient management of social relationships&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;",

Findings indicate that while participants felt some autonomy with the VR headset, they experienced a lack of autonomy, competence, and relatedness in the storytelling. Participants engaged in perspective-taking but often thought about those close to them who had similar experiences rather than themselves. Thus, a close other’s experience affected whether people engaged in perspective-taking. However, prior experience with IDEA topics did not predict cognitive effort, indicating that individuals with such experience do not exert more cognitive effort than those without it. Additionally, cognitive effort did not predict prosocial attitudes or behaviors. This study highlights the complexities of how previous experiences affect engagement with IDEA-centered VR, perspective-taking, and cognitive effort and suggests directions for future research.",

          "abstract": "This study, grounded in the interpersonal deception theory (IDT), aims to analyze the new form of digital deception known as “visual poverty” in livestreaming rooms. Through a multimodal discourse analysis of the collected data, this study found three distinct linguistic strategies employed in “visual poverty” livestream: illocutionary strategy, discourse strategy, and nonverbal strategy. These strategies are designed to achieve three interactional goals: constructing a false identity, reinforcing credibility, and gaining economic benefits. Based on these findings, this study further analyzed why it is difficult to detect digital deception and proposed suggestions to prevent it. This study theoretically proposes online IDT and offers practical suggestions for preventing digital deception, bearing both theoretical and practical significance.",

          "abstract": "Efforts to scale up fact-checking through technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), are increasingly being suggested and tested. This study examines whether previously observed effects of reading fact-checks remain constant when readers are aware of AI’s involvement in the fact-checking process. We conducted three online experiments ( N = 3,978), exposing participants to fact-checks identified as either human-generated or AI-assisted, simulating cases where AI fully generates the fact-check or automatically retrieves human fact-checks. Our findings indicate that the persuasive effect of fact-checking, specifically in increasing truth discernment, persists even among participants without a positive prior attitude toward AI. Additionally, in some cases, awareness of AI’s role reduced perceived political bias in fact-checks among Republicans. Finally, neither AI-generated nor human fact-checks significantly affected participants’ feelings toward or their perceptions of the competence of the targeted politicians.",

          "abstract": "Despite the ubiquity of dating apps, there is little longitudinal research examining the mental health and well-being of dating app users. To fill this void, this study takes a social compensation approach to exploring dating app users’ burnout experiences (i.e., emotional exhaustion, inefficacy, and depersonalization) over time. Four hundred ninety-three active single dating app users were surveyed over four waves across 12 weeks, with a final sample of 190. Multilevel growth curve models showed that dating app users experienced increased emotional exhaustion and inefficacy over time. Furthermore, depression, anxiety, and loneliness predicted more emotional exhaustion and inefficacy, while problematic dating app use predicted more emotional exhaustion and less inefficacy. The results suggest that dating apps may exacerbate existing difficulties with relationship initiation among vulnerable users by increasing their risk of burnout. Dating app burnout is a potential intervention target to improve users’ dating success.",

          "abstract": "The concept of ‘audience’ is central to research and practice in science communication. When asked by a scientist for help communicating their work, who among us has not responded with the time honoured question ‘who is your audience?’ Yet what we mean when we talk about audience is not always clear: implied and ambiguous, rather than explicit and precise. This article explores this ambiguity, drawing on a systematic review of 1360 science communication research articles and a survey of 45 science communication educators. We report 10 different conceptualisations, in three groups. Being conceptualisations include ‘Demographic’, ‘Knowledge’, ‘Values’ and ‘Embodied’; Doing conceptualisations include ‘Interaction’ and ‘Dynamic’. In Qualifiers, we found ‘Diverse’, ‘Potential’, ‘Plural’ and ‘General’ conceptualisations. These data allow tracking of how we have conceptualised audience over time, an understanding of the groups systematically under-serviced, and a pathway to a richer discussion of this key concept for our field.",

          "authors": "Tanvir Ahammad, Siam Ahmed, Selina Sharmin",
          "abstract": "The Rohingya refugee crisis, a humanitarian tribulation involving the persecution of the Rohingya Muslim ethnic minority group in Myanmar, has led to a massive exodus of refugees, primarily women and children, to neighboring Bangladesh. Analyzing public opinion toward the Rohingya crisis poses a challenge due to the time complexity of manually assessing individual expressions from the vast amount of text on online platforms. This research focuses on identifying hidden patterns in online discussions surrounding the Rohingya refugee crisis, employing topic modeling and a thematic sentiment analysis-based approach. It represents the first comprehensive exploration of public views on internet spaces to support this community. In the experiment, we identified 15 coherent topics from 6,840 unique documents with a high coherence score of about 0.60. The key themes explored encompass familial resilience, the urgency of addressing the refugee crisis, complexities within the Rohingya situation, religious and cultural elements, and geopolitical considerations. Sentiment analysis revealed nuanced emotional tones, with positive sentiments in discussions about refugee support and international aid and mixed or negative sentiments in topics concerning religious dynamics and women’s protection. The implications of this research extend to guiding policymakers, humanitarian organizations, and advocacy groups in developing targeted interventions, communication strategies, and informed policy initiatives. In addition, the findings emphasize the importance of understanding and responding effectively to the multifaceted challenges faced by the Rohingya community.",

          "abstract": "This exploratory study focuses on the public as a listening ensemble that takes part in public diplomacy on Twitter. Here, listening is considered as the receiving component of communication, and responsive behavior as its visible product. The focus is on public communication that followed Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. A total of 4,392 quote tweets (citing the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky’s tweets mentioning Ukraine’s possible membership in the European Union) were analyzed using the taxonomy of verbal response modes. Two major modes were identified: responses to the situation by sharing information and persuasion, and responses to Zelensky, Ukrainians, and the public by disclosing feelings and opinions. Interestingly, the different social roles of the public were associated with how much interaction was elicited. The listening public contributes to global deliberativeness; not strictly from an issue-oriented problem-solving perspective, but in the sense that they weave together analytical and social aspects of deliberative reflection.",

          "authors": "Frankie Ho Chun Wong",
          "abstract": "This study investigates how digital connectivity may influence news coverage of protests globally. Scholars argue that the arrival of the digital age did not overthrow legacy media but built a hybrid media system where old and new media logics work together. Although some recent studies highlighted that mobile internet access enabled protestors to gain media attention internationally, evidence also suggests that regimes were increasingly capable of controlling media environments to shape news coverage of conflicts. It remains unclear if connectivity allows citizens to bypass limitations in free speech to increase protest visibility on a global scale. Leveraging the latest global coverage of the Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project data and data from other well-established projects, this study consolidated a dataset of 162 countries between 2018 and 2021 on connectivity, protests, and media attention. Multilevel negative binomial regressions results showed that new and old media logics both explained media attention on protests. Higher mobile ownership and broader network coverage in a country predicted more media attention, but not social media penetration. Larger and richer countries, and protests that were more violent and fatal also received more coverage. Nevertheless, the effects of connectivity were constrained by the level of freedom of expression in a country. Country-level interactions showed lower freedom of expression and significantly attenuated the effect of connectivity on media attention. This study demonstrated the dynamics in the hybrid media system. While connectivity enabled more protest information to flow, states could have found methods to curb it from getting viral, thus living with it at a manageable level.",

          "abstract": "Mounting concern surrounds the influence of political actors on journalism, especially as media outlets face increasing financial pressures. These circumstances can give rise to instances of media capture, a mutually corrupting relationship between political actors and media organizations. However, empirical evidence substantiating such mechanisms and their consequences remains limited, particularly in the context of Western democracies. This chapter investigates a recent case in which a former Austrian chancellor allegedly colluded with a tabloid newspaper to receive better news coverage in exchange for increased ad placements by government institutions. We employ automated content analysis to investigate political news articles from seventeen prominent Austrian news outlets spanning 2012–2021 ( n = 222,659). Adopting a difference-in-differences approach, we find a substantial increase in media visibility of the former Austrian chancellor within the news outlet that is alleged to have received bribes, as well as a decrease in favorability for challenger candidates. Although this study does not aim to prove or disprove the involvement of specific political actors or media organizations in unethical or illegal activities, it introduces an innovative method for detecting unusual patterns in media reporting. Findings are discussed in the context of current threats to media independence and underscore the crucial need to protect journalistic integrity and ensure unbiased information for the public.",
