          "authors": "Pranav Malhotra, Natalie-Anne Hall, Yiping Xia, Louise Stahl, Andrew Chadwick, Cristian Vaccari, Brendan T Lawson",
          "abstract": "We argue for more serious consideration of interpretive qualitative approaches in research on information credibility evaluation in digitally mediated contexts. Through reviewing existing literature on credibility and drawing on our own experiences of conducting research projects on credibility evaluation in diverse cultural contexts, we contend that interpretive qualitative approaches help researchers develop a much-needed communicative and relationally and culturally situated understanding of credibility, complicating dominant quantitative and psychologically-oriented accounts. We detail how these approaches add important nuance to how credibility is conceptualized and operationalized and reveal the complexity of credibility evaluation as a social process. We also outline how they aid researchers studying misinformation engagement, especially in popular bounded social media places like private groups and chats. The approach we develop here provides new insights that can inform ongoing global efforts by researchers, policy makers, and citizens to more fully understand the complexity of information verification online.",

          "authors": "Neil Sadler",
          "abstract": "The concept of narrative has been widely employed in the disinformation literature. Nonetheless, its use has been dominated by loose intuitions of what narratives are and do alongside vague accounts of specific stories. Theorized more carefully, thinking in terms of narrative has much to offer disinformation studies by helping to better define what constitutes disinformation and providing sophisticated frameworks for assessing specific content. To enable a nuanced view of narrative truth, I propose a “hermeneutic realist” approach in which stories “disclose” wider realities rather than constructing or simply reflecting them, supplemented with Phelan’s “narrative ethics” to facilitate inquiry into how far stories are morally legitimate. I apply these ideas in a case study of Twitter content posted by a Venezuelan political influencer blaming Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine on NATO enlargement. In so doing, I show that content may be referentially and ethically problematic without necessarily being false.",

          "authors": "Elaine Jing Zhao",
          "abstract": "This article proposes the politics of streaming time as a productive analytical lens to unflatten more general accounts of nonlinearity and acceleration, to reveal the mediating role of streaming services and broader power relations around terms of access in value reconfiguration, and to critique the cultural-economic logics of the streaming economy. Building on the literature on media and time in the internet society, and integrating platform studies and television studies, this article analyses the politics of streaming time with reference to Chinese streaming services’ turn to the subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) model, a process negotiated among multiple parties including streaming services, advertisers, audiences and regulators. The analysis shows how streaming services orchestrate elastic schedules in concert with flexible pricing and dynamic bundling to manipulate temporal and affective experiences of viewers while causing contingent boundaries of subscriber benefits. It explains how the data-contingent approach confronts subscribers with a boomerang moment of temporal displacement and surge pricing. Further, it reveals how multiple temporalities including artificial ephemerality, collusive synchronicity and metric thresholding as well as reconfigured televisual linearity are mediated to entice and extract value from subscribers. The conclusion reflects on how exploring the politics of streaming time allows a more textured understanding of emerging temporalities and the negotiation around terms of access in an increasingly contingent cultural market.",

          "authors": "Alexander Vandewalle, Richard Cole",
          "abstract": "The various ways that players actually play historical games, and how history – or players’ conceptualization thereof – impacts play processes, remains understudied in the field of historical game studies. This study investigates how players make decisions in historical games, and assesses to what extent such choices are directed by historical considerations or ideas of history. Specifically, we examined this through the perspective of ergodic characterization, or players’ nontrivial involvement in the characterization of their in-game character. We conducted an active play experiment where Classics students from Belgium and the United Kingdom ( n = 10) played Assassin’s Creed Odyssey ( Ubisoft Quebec, 2018 ) for eight weeks and reported on their experiences through questionnaires, note-taking, and focus group interviews. We found that players’ characterization decisions in historical games were driven by four play interests: ludic (i.e., characterization based on the gameplay advantages that choices might bring, or to test out specific affordances of the game system), prosthetic (characterization as an extension of the player’s own personality), narrative (characterization based on the character’s narrative and background), and referential (characterization in reference to other characters, including historical ones). We also report other findings related to characterization and the role of history in historical game experiences. This article offers new insights into player experiences of historical games, contributes empirical data to existing research on characterization in games, and advocates for active play as a research method in historical game studies.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the paradigm shift in the film and animation industry driven by the advent of real-time rendering technology. Through an approach combining qualitative interviews with industry practitioners and quantitative analysis of survey data, the study delves into the multifaceted impact of this technology. The research highlights the technology’s potential to enhance creativity, speed, and efficiency in production, while also emphasizing the challenges it poses, including technical complexities and the need for specialized knowledge. A notable theme of democratization emerges, with participants indicating that real-time rendering can help make high-quality production tools more accessible and enable a broader range of creators to participate in the industry. This study also reflects on the complexities of technological democratization, emphasizing that access to real-time tools remains uneven and shaped by broader structural factors.",

          "abstract": "This study conducts a conceptual replication and extension of prior research on overconfidence in discerning political misinformation, shifting focus to health. Using data from a national survey of American adults linked to web-browsing records (N=593), we investigated the prevalence and correlates of overconfidence in this domain. Consistent with earlier findings, overconfidence was most pronounced among low-performing individuals, replicating the “Dunning–Kruger Effect.” However, decomposition analyses revealed that the associations between overconfidence and behavioral correlates—exposure to low-credibility health websites and belief in cancer-related misinformation—are primarily accounted for by deficits in actual discernment ability rather than a lack of metacognitive insight. This replication highlights the robustness of the link between poor discernment and behavioral outcomes across domains. These results highlight the need for interventions that improve evaluation skills or address underlying dispositional factors, such as distrust in science and conspiracist worldviews.",

          "abstract": "Despite a rise in identity-centric communication scholarship, there is a lack of theory and evidence regarding how media use relates to the on-going alignment between political and social identities (i.e., identity alignment). We offer a framework for theorizing this dynamic and apply it to examine the relationship between Americans’ media diets and on-going psychological alignment between political and social identities in the United States (i.e., partisan social sorting). We use data from 33,690 American respondents from three national surveys: one longitudinal (1972–2020) and two fielded in 2020. There is evidence that identity alignment (i.e., sorting) has grown over time, but only among those who are most interested and attentive to politics and media. In 2020 surveys, we find no evidence that the frequency of media use was a significant predictor of social sorting. Instead, the composition of individuals’ media diets predicted the alignment between their social and political identities.",

          "abstract": "This article analyzes how streaming users in Latin America experience time in relation to platforms. Drawing on a mixed-methods approach that employed daily reports of platform usage, focus groups, and “rich picture” analysis, we examine the cases of two countries with some of the highest digital media usage statistics in Latin America: Brazil and Costa Rica. We conceptualize platform users in these countries as “temporal publics,” defined by their varied experiences of time and the complexity of their “time work” practices. The article discusses how individuals engage in recalibration practices to navigate the temporal ambivalences of everyday life and what they perceive as the power of streaming platforms to control their time. By doing so, we demonstrate how users simultaneously reproduce and subvert specific temporal orders through their everyday interactions with streaming services, reflecting a sustained and intentional ambivalence toward the platforms’ power.",

          "abstract": "The rapid dissemination of misinformation has raised concerns about its persistence despite corrective efforts, as the influence of fact-checking often diminishes quickly. This study explores “time” as a central theoretical and methodological construct in understanding the effects of fact-checking interventions. Across two large-scale, pre-registered panel experiments (N = 6,983), we examine the temporal dynamics of both the persuasive and unintended consequences of factual corrections. Results show that while fact-checks yield immediate belief updating, their effects largely fade within two weeks and do not produce durable belief echoes. In Study 2, we introduce a novel design treating time lag as an experimental treatment and show that simple interventions aimed at increasing the temporal accessibility of corrections—termed “accuracy reminders”—significantly extend the durability of their effects. These findings reconceptualize correction effects as inherently temporal processes, advancing communication theory and offering scalable, time-sensitive strategies for sustaining the influence of fact-checking in dynamic information environments.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, emerging technologies and neoliberal policies have transformed the way people work. This article explores the impact of sociotechnical change on platformized cultural production, where creators depend on digital platforms to make a living. By examining the case of American romance writers, the paper reveals how unique solidaristic practices, including gender-focused community building, an emphasis on pan-hierarchical connections, and communicative norms of open information-sharing, empowered romance authors throughout the platformization of publishing. Through 57 in-depth interviews and 40 years of archival research, the study demonstrates how these practices facilitated the diffusion of digital self-publishing, reducing romance writers’ precarity. By introducing a novel, multi-level communicative framework, this paper integrates meso-level theories of innovation with macro- and micro-level understandings of platform power. This framework provides a new model for understanding collective agency within platformized industries The paper contributes to broader discussions of “good work,” suggesting that communicative strategies can reshape power imbalances even under platformized conditions.",

          "abstract": "Disabled people are overrepresented as victims of sexual violence and family violence, but are often excluded from research and the development of communication campaigns, laws, and interventions. Grounded in the culture-centered approach, we undertook 77 qualitative interviews with predominantly Māori (Indigenous) and low-income disabled individuals to identify primary prevention needs for reducing family and sexual violence. Participants articulated disability as being structural, intersectional, and layered with erasure, contributing to conditions that perpetuate violence. Erasure and the resulting loss of agency were pervasive across diverse disabilities and participant groups, with Māori bearing a disproportionate burden. Emergent in the participants’ narratives were strategies around addressing communication inequalities and grounding prevention resources within local community contexts, set against structural determinants of violence perpetuated by the settler colonial State. This study challenges the hegemonic approach to addressing sexual violence and family violence, revealing a relationship between communicative and material forms of violence.",

          "authors": "Curd B Knüpfer, W Lance Bennett, Ulrike Klinger",
          "abstract": "This study examines the mechanisms by which illiberal politics make the news by disrupting democratic systems. During the late 20th century, a liberal journalistic consensus in most democracies developed guidelines for gatekeeping political voices and views in the news. In recent years, illiberal politics and changing media systems have challenged those press norms. Politically marginalized parties can make the news by disrupting party systems, elections, and policy processes. The presented case of German news coverage of the United Nations Global Compact for Migration shows that disproportionate media attention to the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party was not related to its size or policy impact, but to the strategic disruption of the political process itself. Making news via democratic disruption constitutes what we term “indexing by proxy” that undermines a core democratic journalism norm by amplifying coverage of illiberal actors that challenge the legitimacy of various public institutions, including legacy journalism.",

Building on artificial intelligent (AI)-mediated communication (AI-MC), this study examines how people use LLM-based chatbots to generate support messages and how patterns of human–AI collaboration shape message features and influence message evaluations of helpfulness and authenticity. We propose the process-adoption model, categorizing message generation into four patterns: human-only, AI-only, modified-AI, and AI-guided. Results showed that AI-only and modified-AI messages were more likely than human-only messages to include informational and emotional support, which in turn, enhanced viewers’ evaluations of message helpfulness and authenticity. AI-guided messages were more likely to provide reciprocal self-disclosure than AI-only messages, which enhanced perceived authenticity. Lastly, AI-guided messages were rated as more authentic than AI-only messages even after accounting for the mediating effects of message features. These findings provide a nuanced understanding of the AI-MC spectrum, and discussions are provided about human–AI collaboration in support provision.",

Specifically, our study examines how differences in two perceived affordances—persistence and visibility—affect how women viewers evaluate the authenticity of men who post allyship messages on Instagram. Additionally, we examine how viewer perceptions of comment deletion and comment restriction impact source evaluations. Results indicate that greater perceived persistence and visibility led women viewers to rate ostensible allies as more authentic and less self-interested. Moreover, comment deletion and restriction were found to partially affect how viewers evaluated ally authenticity and motive, providing additional support to warranting theory. Implications for promoting prosocial messaging and digital allyship online are discussed.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Storme, Martin Storme",
          "abstract": "In many languages, masculine forms are used generically. However, extensive research demonstrates that these forms exhibit a male bias that can adversely affect the perception of opportunities by women. To address this issue, alternative linguistic forms have been proposed, typically categorized into two main strategies: feminization and neutralization. Both approaches have proven effective in reducing the male bias of masculine forms. However, their relative effectiveness remains unclear. This study investigates this question in French. We compare gender representations elicited by three linguistic forms—masculine forms, pair forms (feminization), and neutral forms (neutralization)—against a stereotypical baseline. Our findings reveal that, in stereotypically neutral contexts, neutralization and feminization are equally effective in counteracting the male bias of masculine forms. However, in male- or female-dominated contexts, feminization is less sensitive to contextual bias and therefore more successful in mitigating the influence of stereotypes. Implications and limitations are discussed.",

          "authors": "Jieni Zhou, Taylor N. West, Catherine J. Berman, Barbara L. Fredrickson",
          "abstract": "The affective quality of social interaction is linked to the well-being of individuals, relationships, and communities. This construct has been measured in multiple ways, albeit rarely concurrently. The current study tests for convergent validity across three methodologically distinct measures of the affective quality of social interaction. In a video-recorded laboratory session, a sample of university students ( N = 274) got acquainted with an unknown peer in a 10-min semi-structured conversation that used the fast friends procedure with escalating self-disclosure. After the conversation, participants privately completed the Perceived Positivity Resonance Scale to indicate the degree to which they experienced mutual, kind-hearted positive affect. Later, trained observers coded videos (with audio) to identify wide-ranging dyad-level behavioral indicators of positivity resonance. In addition, audio recordings were submitted to an automated voice-to-text transcription service that provided high-resolution time stamps for turn-taking to compute participants’ conversational response time. A confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated good fit with all three indicators loading significantly on a single latent factor. In addition, relative to single indicators, the resulting factor score (i.e., affective quality of social interaction) showed the most consistent associations with prosocial tendencies and positive mental health. These findings (1) are the first to show the convergence of self-reported and observer-coded positivity resonance, (2) extend the evidence that these indices of positivity resonance align with conversational response time in the context of strangers getting acquainted, and (3) replicate past evidence of benefits linked to the positive affective quality of social interaction. Discussion centers on theoretical and methodological implications for studies of social connectedness.",

          "abstract": "The interpersonal consequences of anger coping (i.e., anger-in, anger-out, anger-control) in everyday life are unclear. This ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study tested whether momentary variations in anger coping style were associated with the perceived quality of subsequent interpersonal interactions throughout the day. Lifetime discrimination and race were tested as moderators of these associations. A sample of 518 Black and Latinx participants (age range = 23–65, M = 38.9; 50.4% men, 49.6% women) completed surveys measuring demographics and perceived discrimination, and EMAs of anger coping and perceptions of interpersonal interaction quality every 20 minutes during waking hours. At a between-person level, those who reported more frequent use of either anger-in or anger-out also reported more negative interactions throughout the day. At the within-person level, observations during which people reported using anger-in (vs. anger-out or anger-control) were negatively associated with the quality of the interpersonal interaction on the subsequent observation 20 minutes later. Discrimination moderated the effects of anger coping. For individuals who reported experiencing higher levels discrimination, observations in which they held anger-in (vs. did not) were associated with worse subsequent interpersonal interaction quality. In contrast, for those who reported experiencing lower levels of discrimination, observations in which they expressed anger-outwardly (vs. did not) were associated with worse subsequent interpersonal interaction quality. This study provides evidence of person by context interactions in the interpersonal consequences of anger expression and may inform the development of culturally sensitive interventions to mitigate the effects of discrimination.",

          "authors": "Pınar Özdemir",
          "abstract": "Earlier studies have extended the literature on sacrifice by examining the positive and negative effects and addressing two different aspects of sacrifice, i.e., perceived as satisfying and perceived as harmful. However, there has been less focus on the psychological mechanisms that underlie the perception of sacrifice as harmful within couple relationships. The present study investigates whether the perception of sacrifice harmfulness is associated with couple burnout and explores the roles of relational equity and appreciation in these relationships. The participants comprised 749 married individuals residing in various cities across Türkiye ( M age = 33.41, SD ¼ = 9.12). Data were collected using the Demographic Information Form, the Couple Burnout Measure, the Appreciation in Relationships Scale, the Relational Equity Scale, and the Perceived Sacrifice Harmfulness Scale. The PROCESS macro was used to simultaneously test the mediation effect of relational equity and the moderation effect of being appreciated (Model 8). The findings indicated that perceived sacrifice harmfulness was positively associated with couple burnout and negatively associated with relational equity. Relational equity partially mediated the relationship between perceived sacrifice harmfulness and couple burnout. Moreover, the perception of being appreciated moderated this mediation at the first stage of the process. Furthermore, among partners who perceive their sacrifices as harmful, those with low levels of being appreciated feel unequal within the relationship. The results from this study extend research on the potential consequences of perceived sacrifice harmfulness and emphasize the importance of uncovering the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, while these findings do not provide direct practical implications, they offer insights that may inform behavioral recommendations for couples in clinical settings.",

          "authors": "Betül Kabasakal, Elif Cimsir",
          "abstract": "With ghosting emerging as a prominent trend in interpersonal relationships, questions have arisen about how individuals perceive both ghosting and those who engage in it within cross-sex close relationships. This study employed a between-subjects experimental design with a 2 (Relationship Context: Friendship vs. Romantic Relationship) × 2 (Participant Gender: Female vs. Male) × 2 (Ghoster Gender: Female vs. Male) framework. Participants ( N = 224; M = 23.76, SD = 4.61 , range = 18–50; 50% female) evaluated one of four hypothetical scenarios regarding the appropriateness of ghosting and the likability of the ghoster. The findings revealed that ghosting was perceived as equally inappropriate in both heterosexual romantic and cross-sex friendship contexts. Male participants rated ghosters as more likable in romantic scenarios, while female participants showed no significant differences across contexts. Both genders viewed ghosting as more acceptable when performed by their own gender, reflecting an in-group bias. However, while male participants rated ghosters of both genders equally likable, female participants rated female ghosters as more likable than male ghosters. Furthermore, prior engagement in ghosting was associated with more favorable attitudes toward both ghosting and ghosters, whereas having been ghosted did not significantly alter perceptions. These findings highlight the nuanced interplay of gender, relational context, and personal experiences in shaping perceptions of ghosting, offering valuable insights into the social and interpersonal mechanisms that drive evaluations of relationship behaviors, particularly within a non-Western cultural context. Future research should explore a broader range of gender identities and relationship dynamics to better capture diverse experiences and deepen our understanding of this common relational behavior.",

Analysis of the 2020 American National Election Study finds that right-partisan media use is associated with lower support for redistributive policies, and this relationship is strongest among individuals who identify as lower-class or Independent. We also found the relationship between right-partisan media use and taxing the rich was strongest among lower-class Republicans and upper-class Democrats.

Attribution to BBC News significantly increased message credibility. Importantly, however, participants’ responses to false messages attributed to BBC News were statistically indistinguishable from their responses to true messages.

We found that esports podcasts introductions borrow elements of traditional sports journalism and talk radio, as well as “talkier” styles and elements of “podcastness” from newer media. At the same time, esports podcasters seem to move away from professional radio broadcast styles as their shows mature, signaling the development of unique professional norms in the podcast space.",

We examine how such spaces facilitate civic self-organization through their hybrid online/offline, public/private, and local/global dynamics and how they function as local civic infrastructure during times of crisis. Using a mixed-methods analytical approach, we examined 47 public Telegram groups from Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic. We identified a fundamental tension between political discussion and practical help in these spaces, resolvable through active horizontal participation (including norm negotiation and self-moderation), or strict vertical moderation. Additional challenges included a lack of access to vulnerable groups and limited outreach to local civil society actors, both of which hindered group activity and structural connections within local civic infrastructure. Despite these challenges, our study highlights the potential of local chat groups for self-organization, albeit primarily among privileged urban individuals.

We conducted a survey on a representative sample of German adults to discover the media ensembles of (geographically dispersed) friend groups and to explore the relationship between these ensembles and connectedness. A cluster analysis revealed four clusters, ranging from a traditional cluster occasionally communicating through emails and voice calls to a cluster that frequently uses several media, including games and discussion forums.

          "authors": "Debbie Ging, Stephane Baele, Lewys Brace, Simone Long, Shane Murphy",
          "abstract": "Like most online radical movements, the incel community heavily relies on images to express and amplify its ideology; yet its visual practices have not yet been comprehensively analysed. Using an original dataset of 31,925 images scraped from seven online spaces of the ‘incelosophere’, we implement the first large-scale, systematic analysis of incel images. Combining a codebook-guided quantitative analysis with a qualitative interpretation of representative images, we demonstrate the merits of studying incel imagery to enhance more frequent methods such as textual analysis. Specifically, our study documents three major roles played by images in the incelosphere. First, they consolidate incel misogynist and lookist narratives by exhibiting archetypal group categories. Second, they structure the community’s collective affective expression, intensifying shared emotions and shaping members’ perceptions of self and others. Third, images reflect divisions within the incelosphere, demonstrating the ideological and platform-specific heterogeneity of this ecosystem and evidencing influence from far-right digital milieux.",

          "abstract": "Social media and artificial intelligence have made it easier than ever to create and widely spread manipulated content. Recent geopolitical and digital developments underscore the need for more research on the topic, even in the Nordic countries with their recognised resilience against dis- and misinformation. This integrative review ( N = 359) examines how dis- and misinformation have been studied across disciplines in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden between 2014 and 2024. The diversity of terminology and fields in this research highlights its significance and the potential for cross-disciplinary and cross-border collaboration. The article identifies five main topics within the literature: security and Russia’s actions; media and fact-checking; health; media literacy; and social media. While Nordic countries share similarities in dis- and misinformation research, Finland, Norway, and Sweden are more closely aligned with each other than with Denmark or Iceland. This study also identifies research gaps, including the need for more psychological and cognitive science research on dis- and misinformation. Overall, it provides a more comprehensive understanding of dis- and misinformation in the Nordic countries than previously available.",

          "abstract": "Ghosting—or indirectly ceasing communication to end a relationship—has become common with the rising popularity of online dating. Despite its ubiquity, little is known regarding the immediate causal impact of being ghosted compared to explicit rejection. In two studies, participants were immersed in a sequential dating scenario simulating the early development of an online relationship to experimentally test emotional and behavioral responses to ambiguous rejection (i.e., ghosting), explicit rejection, and acceptance. Ghosted and explicitly rejected participants reported high negative emotion as well as low positive emotion and self‐esteem. However, ghosted participants reported ongoing emotional attachment to the target compared to those who were explicitly rejected. Ghosted participants also intended to monitor the target's social media and dating app status and text/call over time to the same extent as accepted participants, demonstrating a lack of closure. This work illustrates the causal effects of being ghosted, characterized by emotional pain without closure and disengagement.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a novel form of media, capable of generating human-like text and facilitating interactive communications. However, these systems are subject to concerns regarding inherent biases, as their training on vast text corpora may encode and amplify societal biases. This study investigates overestimation bias in LLM-generated climate assessments, wherein the impacts of climate change are exaggerated relative to expert consensus. Through non-parametric statistical methods, the study compares expert ratings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2023 Synthesis Report with responses from GPT-family LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs systematically overestimate climate change impacts, and that this bias is more pronounced when the models are prompted in the role of a climate scientist. These findings underscore the critical need to align LLM-generated climate assessments with expert consensus to prevent misperception and foster informed public discourse.",

Using a three-condition between-subjects survey experiment ( N = 723), we found that respondents in the experimental (vs. control) conditions reported greater perceived aggression, which was negatively associated with perceived trustworthiness of the scientist. The negative effects of the audio clips with satire on perceived trustworthiness were mediated by experienced mirth. Our results offer evidence that scientists who use satire may be seen as less trustworthy than those who do not, likely because of the aggression perceived in the jokes.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Solverson, Stefan Geiß, Melanie Magin",
          "abstract": "Democratic citizenship is continuously evolving, shaped by changing political, social, and media contexts. Digital natives—those who have come of age in environments where digital technologies are embedded in everyday life—have experienced citizenship in markedly different ways than previous generations. While the internet has broadened the repertoire of participatory behaviors, existing research has struggled to capture the complexity of contemporary citizenship. Drawing on deliberative systems theory and a triadic framework of citizenship—examining normative expectations, behaviors, and attitudes—this study develops a nuanced exploration of citizenship orientations. Using an innovative questionnaire and latent profile analysis of survey data from Norwegian digital natives (aged 18–40), we identify seven distinct citizenship types that reveal the multidimensional nature of contemporary citizenship. Our research moves beyond binary distinctions between active and passive citizenship, emphasizing the importance of both expressive and receptive behaviors across online and offline contexts. By highlighting the diverse roles citizens play in sustaining democratic processes, we offer new insights into citizenship in the digital age, demonstrating how different citizens contribute to the democratic system through varied and interdependent forms of engagement.",

          "authors": "Chunfeng Lin",
          "abstract": "The rise of short-video platforms has transformed identity into a hyper-commodified asset, merging performative self-presentation with algorithmic governance. This article introduces the fetishized identity economy (FIE), a theoretical framework that reinterprets Marxian commodity fetishism, Bourdieusian symbolic capital, and Baudrillardian hyperreality to analyze how digital personas are constructed, staged, and monetized. The FIE framework centers on three interrelated concepts: persona capital (algorithmically optimized self-performance), staged class (the commodification of social status as symbolic spectacle), and platform capitalism (the cultural and ideological shaping of profitable identity performances). Through a case study of Chinese influencer Sister Yu, the article illustrates how identity under the FIE is engineered rather than expressed, shaped by state-platform synergies that reward particular narratives of gender, labor, and class. By doing so, this study critiques the neoliberal assumptions embedded in Western influencer discourse and offers an alternative lens to understand the complex interplay of identity, governance, and platform logics. The research contributes to ongoing debates on platform labor, attention economies, and the global contours of influencer culture.",

          "abstract": "Drawing from dynamic systems theory, we examine how incivility is collectively constructed in an online discussion community. Using secondary data consisting of comments shared over a 3-week period to an online news community, we identified three sequences that reflect collective incivility practices. Whereas the persistent incivility sequence included a large proportion of uncivil comments, incivility occurred infrequently in the sporadic incivility sequence and not at all in the no incivility sequence. Once the persistent incivility or sporadic incivility sequences appeared, discussions were more likely to return to these sequences than the no incivility sequence. Contrary to our predictions, sequences containing incivility shaped discussion processes by depressing explicit expressions of agreement and disagreement. The results of this study demonstrate how the collective behavior of online community members contributes to the production and effects of incivility.",

          "authors": "Dongjing Kang,  Chinaiwengmu",
          "abstract": "Lamu, a 30-year-old Tibetan woman, tragically died when her ex-husband set her on fire during a livestream on Douyin in Sichuan province in 2021. Following her death, the #LamuAct sparked an anti-domestic violence (DV) movement on major Chinese platforms. Informed by a decolonial feminist perspective, we conceptualize the “Good Woman of Tibet” focusing on two cultural imaginaries, lhamo (the Goddess) and srinamo (the Demoness), to explore the landscape of #LamuAct and how Tibetan women from rural regions of Southwest China understand DV. Through the thematic analysis of social media discourses and 21 in-depth interviews, the results show how social media discourse and local narratives intersect and diverge in shaping contemporary Tibetan women’s understanding of DV. The significant divergence between online and offline narrative surrounding the srinamo imaginary reveals a complex ambivalence toward powerful women—who symbolize resistance against traditional Tibetan patriarchy and embody the agency to voice experiences of DV. The convergence calls for a responsive legal approach: “un-domesticize” the violence to reframe DV. This study contributes to decolonial feminist scholarship and expands social media activism on DV by incorporating rural women’s perspectives beyond the digital sphere.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the intricate interplay between identity construction and multimodal communication in the evolving landscape of Virtual Influencers (VIs), with a particular focus on Lil Miquela . It addresses a critical gap in understanding how algorithmic infrastructures mediate identity performance through complex semiotic and chronotopic configurations. Adopting a techno-affective and social semiotic approach, the research conducts a chronotopic analysis of 35 (sponsored) posts from Lil Miquela ’s official Instagram account (21 January–June 2024), integrating Bakhtin’s chronotope with Danesi’s semiotic model. Guided by three key questions, the article explores: (1) the role of emojis as semiotic resources in her digital identity construction; (2) the mediation of her spatiotemporal identity dynamics by algorithmic infrastructures; and (3) the relationship between multimodal affordances, techno-affective elements and perceptions of authenticity. By interrogating the intersection of chronotopic configurations, algorithmic mediation and digital semiotics, this research reveals how her identity is continuously (re)negotiated in response to shifting algorithmic and socio-discursive conditions. Ultimately, it contributes to a deeper understanding of how VIs navigate digital authenticity and identity performance within the constraints and affordances of algorithmic mediation.",
