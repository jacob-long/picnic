          "authors": "Agata Waszkiewicz, Kristian A. Bjørkelo",
          "abstract": "This article examines how games continue and represent the historical rituals of invective poetry exchanges. The article juxtaposes the analog, multiplayer card game Cards Against Humanity , known for its transgressive, profanity-based humor, with two single-player video games that present the invective poetry competition as (more or less) historically accurate activity. The former is argued to be a continuation of the same tradition that encompasses various historical practices such as Germanic flyting or African sounding, while the latter is an attempt at representation, without inviting the players to participate in the same practices. The difference between the card game, which makes a freer use of profanities, and the video game representation, which is devoid of it, are used to discuss to investigate the importance of the rituals involving invective poetry in the contemporary culture, as well as theorize about the differences seen in the analog and video games.",

We begin by exploring the interplays of colonialism, imperialism, and racial capitalism that have shaped the origins and uses of qualitative methods toward serving extractive agendas of global capital. This critique serves as the basis for outlining the key principles of the CCA, turning to voice, storytelling, and embodied action as the basis for situating qualitative methods amidst anticolonial struggles that resist settler colonialism and extractive neoliberal neocolonialism. Through our review of diverse culture-centered interventions, we explore the roles of voice infrastructures in anticolonial resistance, outlining the contribution made by the CCA to decolonizing research methods by offering a theoretical-methodological framework for communication interventions for social justice.",

This research centers The Marshall Project’s News Inside , not as an antidote to the unfreedom of prison life, but as a space of significant (if censored) expression and collaboration between free and incarcerated persons. News Inside marks an alternative to the commercial-driven logics of the mainstream press, raising questions about normative notions of journalism’s role in constructing a nation-state-bound version of the public sphere. News Inside asks what it means for a collective of people who have been unpublicked by the state to create publicity.",

Findings reveal that although job satisfaction remains high at 73.9%, it has decreased by 9.1 percentage points since 2012 to 2013. Both male and female journalists continue to report similar levels of job satisfaction. Job security and income satisfaction remain the strongest predictors of overall job satisfaction.

A content analysis of 987 TikTok videos and 201 broadcasts of the Flemish children’s news program Karrewiet was conducted using a codebook developed through focus groups with children aged 8 to 12 ( N = 101) and validated via member-check interviews. Results revealed that television news relies on experts and child sources for consolation, while TikTok avoids sensational images and emphasizes the reporter’s role. In addition, the findings highlight challenges adults face in assessing potentially frightening content for children and recommend involving children in research and editorial decision-making.",

          "abstract": "Across two studies, the current work sought to understand the impact of elaboration questions in political discussion on perceptions of feeling heard and future discussion intentions. Participants were presented with a recorded video of a political conversation where we manipulated the presence and absence of elaboration questions in political conversations surrounding homelessness (Study 1) and abortion (Study 2). Results indicate the presence of elaboration questions increased perceptions of being heard and intentions to engage in discussion in the future. We also found significant indirect results where the relationship between elaboration questions and intentions to engage in future discussions was mediated by feeling heard. These findings were never moderated by whether participants agreed with the political stance taken in the conversation.",

          "authors": "Pascal Schneiders, Birgit Stark",
          "abstract": "Social media platforms are fundamentally disrupting public communication in two ways. First, non-journalistic actors, such as social media influencers, now have easier access to audiences, increasing the range of epistemic authorities. Second, established news outlets are increasingly reliant on platforms, pressuring them to adapt to the demands of social media. This platformization threatens the quality of public communication and citizens’ realization of their epistemic rights. Drawing on these concerns, this article offers a holistic approach to systematically analyze and practically govern epistemic threats to news quality in the platform-driven hybrid news ecosystem by developing a comprehensive three-stage framework that distinguishes between the production, distribution, and reception of news quality. News quality needs not only to be produced (input) but also to be made visible on platforms (throughput) and processed by audiences (output) in order to contribute to an informed public discourse. Focusing on the EU, the article then discusses current regulatory shortcomings and the need for additional measures to safeguard news quality along its three dimensions.",

          "authors": "Tariq Choucair",
          "abstract": "Scholars have made advancements in how to interpret, with detailed measures, the different characteristics and levels of distinct listening practices used by individuals when they are deliberating (Scudder, 2020, 2022). However, listening is not only a practice that occurs directly, but also a broader phenomenon that occurs across the public sphere (Bächtiger &amp;amp; Parkinson, 2019; Ercan et al., 2019). Public discourse occurs across hybrid media systems (Chadwick, 2017) in complex discursive exchanges (Maia et al., 2023) as networks of publics interact (Bruns, 2023). Such complexity imposes challenges for research to properly understand listening at a macro level. In this article, I present how to map and measure listening at this broader level. I reconstruct the discussion on listening as a normative foundation for political communication, from which we derive three key listening elements: attentiveness, openness, and responsiveness. I outline how listening is measured in direct interactions, to then explain how it can be assessed in public communication and mediated interactions, from the perspective of who listens, who is (or is not) listened to, and the actual listening acts.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how people employ different news consumption strategies in the personalized but overloaded information environment. Specifically, we examine the psychological mechanisms of news curation and news avoidance through fear of missing out (FoMO) and news overload. An autoregressive analysis of two-wave panel data ( N = 834) shows that news use indirectly affects both news consumption strategies first through FoMO and then through news overload on Facebook. More importantly, the indirect effect occurs only for those who engage in cross-cutting discussion at high and middle but not low levels. This finding addresses a classic dilemma: despite growing concern over increased news consumption, social media users are able to strike a balance between staying informed through news curation and protecting themselves from being overloaded by news avoidance. However, these strategies can be biased because users tend to personalize their information intake after encountering disagreeing viewpoints.",

          "abstract": "This research uses Twitter discourse about LGBTQIA+ people as a case study to investigate how changes in social media platform management and policies affect conversations about marginalized communities in digital spaces. We examine Twitter discourse before and after Elon Musk’s acquisition and the immediate dismantling of content moderation efforts to identify changes in aversiveness in conversations about LGBTQIA+ people and users’ engagement with such content. Time-series intervention analyses of 6 months of Twitter data ( n = 323,440) show that tweets with toxicity, insults, and threats increased in the 3 months after Musk’s takeover, although the differences were small. The volatility of aversive content also grew over time. Post-Musk, tweets with severe toxicity and insults received more engagement than before. This research provides insight into Twitter as one representation of the shared reality of today’s cultural moment, with implications for minoritized groups and the free flow of information on social media platforms.",

          "abstract": "Concerns about the decline of traditional forms of civic engagement and local news availability in the United States exist alongside developing forms of activist politics online, with one prominent form of social media-driven activism coming from First Amendment auditors. This study examines the protracted conflict between the governmental authorities of Leon Valley and First Amendment auditors to explore the re-placement of civic engagement for the age of social media, facilitated by the development of what I call paralocal relationships. Paralocal relationships describe a sense of familiarity with and concern toward a place featured in media by viewers who have never been there. First Amendment audits enable paralocal relationships by combining on-the-ground activism with clear and simple calls to action for distant viewers, helping to convert audiences into engaged and invested participants in the political life of featured places and enabling new modes of participatory politics.",

          "authors": "Adrian Rauchfleisch, Daniel Vogler, Gabriele de Seta",
          "abstract": "The language used in public debates and in the news can influence how citizens perceive the risks and benefits of technology. While framing effects on technology perception are well understood, few studies have focused on the effects of specific terms used to describe technology. We analyze how the terms deepfake and synthetic media affect risk and benefit perceptions across application fields. Using Switzerland as a case, our manual content analysis ( n = 380 news articles) reveals a focus on risks in news coverage of deepfakes with minimal use of the term synthetic media. We then tested the effects of the terms on risk and benefit perceptions in a preregistered survey experiment (n = 736 participants). Term choice does not change perceived risks, but “synthetic media” significantly increases perceived benefits across application fields. As a theoretical contribution, we link our findings to the concept of euphemism, proposing that term choice should align with application fields to reflect the risks and benefits of technology. Overall, our study shows that the terms we use to label technology matter, especially for emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.",

          "authors": "Hui Lin, Rafal Zaborowski",
          "abstract": "This article examines Douyin’s gamified features to investigate whether and how they facilitate online sociality. Drawing on literature on online sociality and gamification, this study demonstrates how Douyin’s gaming elements introduce a playful dimension to social interactions and examines the implications of transforming sociality into a game. Using a mixed-method approach comprising the walkthrough method and diary-interview technique, the study finds that gamified features—such as friendship badges, quantified levels, and virtual pets—can encourage social behavior and strengthen interpersonal bonds. However, these effects are primarily confined to small, strong-tie friendship groups and do not extend to larger, weak-tie networks. The findings suggest that Douyin users often display heightened awareness of how algorithms exploit their social behaviors, prompting them to adopt cautious and critical digital practices. The article makes both empirical and methodological contributions by offering a case study of gamification in socialization and demonstrating the utility of the diary-interview approach for analyzing user interactions.",
