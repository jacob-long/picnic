          "authors": "Reilly Smethurst, Orestis Papageorgiou, Ben Egliston",
          "abstract": "Blockchain-tokenised media is kitsch. We examined OpenSea’s top 50 collections of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as well as the first two NFTs acquired by New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). We concomitantly developed two concepts: oppositional kitsch, and historically informed kitsch. OpenSea’s profile picture collections exemplify oppositional kitsch: they are described by their creators as anti-normal, degenerate or animalistic. CryptoPunks and Bored Apes are the best-known examples. Historically informed kitsch is, by contrast, pleasant and reassuring. MoMA’s first two NFTs exemplify historically informed kitsch: they are produced by artificial intelligence (AI) models that rely on historical data. For Unsupervised – Machine Hallucinations – MoMA , Refik Anadol trained an AI model with images from MoMA’s GitHub archive. The Unsupervised NFTs are mementos of individuals’ encounters with the work at MoMA. For 3FACE , Ian Cheng created an AI model that draws on blockchain transaction histories. The AI model generates tokenised portraits of individuals based on their transactions. Oppositional kitsch and historically informed kitsch both valorise the individual consumer. OpenSea’s oppositional kitsch lets consumers identify with cartoon figures like CryptoPunks and Bored Apes that are marketed as avatars (alter-egos) and profile pictures. MoMA’s historically informed kitsch sells mementos of individuals’ experiences and portraits that are based on individuals’ consumption choices. Our conception of blockchain-tokenised media as kitsch is primarily informed by the philosophers Alain Badiou and Thorsten Botz-Bornstein as well as the media theorist Jean Baudrillard. These three thinkers treat kitsch as a category of sophistic, liberal-cum-libertarian culture.",

          "abstract": "Video games are part of youth culture and game-making by youth has been studied in relation to knowledge acquisition but to a lesser extent as youth engagement into cultural participation. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted to answer the following research questions: (a) Does there exist, in sources, a conceptualisation of cultural game jams? (b) Who are the main stakeholders and participants? (c) What are the outcomes of cultural game jams? From the 68 eligible sources only 13 mention “Cultural themes” and no conceptualisation of “cultural game-making” was found. Youth, as game-makers, are referred mainly as “students,” co-creators with Education institutions, developers, and creative industries. Youth motivation to participate in jams is related with a future career in game development. Models for the design and assessment of the game jams’ achievement, tools to facilitate ideation, and games are the most referred outcomes of game jams.",

          "authors": "Antti Hämäläinen, Markus Salo, Henri Pirkkalainen",
          "abstract": "Purpose While considerable attention has been directed towards identifying antecedents and consequences of technostress in various contexts, research is lagging on its mitigation, especially in personal use contexts. Here, we explain how individuals employ coping to shield their humanistic and instrumental goals from technostress-related hindrances in personal smartphone use. As individuals’ goals can be considered pivotal in shaping their lives as worthwhile, identifying solutions for managing the negative consequences of technostress on, for instance, users’ well-being and productivity, is paramount. By focusing on smartphones, which are used by billions, we provide impactful insight relevant for numerous stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach We conducted qualitative research by collecting and analyzing rich data (semi-structured interviews) from 38 smartphone users. Findings By investigating coping with smartphone-related technostress that manifests as hindrances to users’ humanistic (e.g. attaining meaningful life) and instrumental (e.g. managing personal information) goals and their sub-goals (e.g. experiencing happiness and maintaining information security, respectively), we address the multidimensional and hierarchical nature of goals. We further extend this perspective by examining how coping relates to goal explicitness: anticipatory coping tends to prevail when goals are explicit, while reactive coping is more common with implicit goals. Additionally, we showed that users' goals, technostress, and the associated coping can be in conflict, requiring goal prioritization from users. Originality/value We address an important gap in the literature by examining the intricate dynamics of coping with the unintended outcomes of personal smartphone use manifesting as technostress-related hindrances to users’ goals.",

          "authors": "Jason Whalley, Volker Stocker",
          "abstract": "Purpose This article analyses the responses to a UK consultation that explored how the regulation of public call boxes could be amended in light of their declining use. By focusing on the responses, we shed light on how old technologies, which are viewed as being technologically inferior, can continue to play a valuable role through generating societal value. Design/methodology/approach The analysis draws on the 23 responses to the consultation. A thematic analysis was undertaken to ascertain the views of respondents. Findings Our analysis highlights the complexities and challenges of regulating old technologies within an industry experiencing sustained technological change. Although the use of public call boxes has declined in the United Kingdom, not least because of the ubiquity of mobile telecommunications, our analysis shows that there is resistance to their removal and amending the range of services that they provide. Furthermore, the underlying technological characteristics of public call boxes that make them available in a power cut complicates their replacement with modern technologies. Our analysis explores how public call boxes act as a “safety net”, providing a means of communications in cases of emergency as well as when someone wants to ring a helpline. Social implications Our analysis highlights the “safety net” role of public call boxes and their role in emergency situations. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first academic article to examine the consultation and through this the role that public call boxes can play in the UK's telecommunications industry.",

Design/methodology/approach Adopting the perspective of information deprivation, we conducted a study with university students in a classroom setting using a serious game and collected both quantitative and qualitative data for analysis. Findings The quantitative analysis reveals that randomness negatively affects the intention to use, with this effect being mediated by perceived control and curiosity. We also show that individuals who have a strong pre-usage arousal-avoidance state are less susceptible to the negative effects of randomness. The qualitative analysis further supports these findings. Combining both analyses, we suggest that the traditional conception of a system on a utilitarian-hedonic dichotomy is not a good boundary condition for randomness-related cognitive models compared to the pre-usage arousal-avoidance state. Originality/value This study is one of the first to explore the effects of randomness in systems at various pre-usage states of users. We introduce measurement entropy to quantify randomness in system environments. It is distinctive from previous metrics because it captures only aleatory uncertainty.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to reveal an inverted U-shaped relationship, showing that a moderate number of elite reviews stimulate the generation of subsequent peer reviews in both volume and novelty, while an excessive number of elite reviews inhibit it. Design/methodology/approach We empirically support our framework using the Yelp Academic Dataset, which includes 500,013 reviews of 2,533 restaurants from 2004 to 2022. We use text mining to convert review texts into quantitative indexes and apply the Heckman two-stage model and propensity score matching to address potential endogeneity issues with robust results. Additionally, we employ GuidedLDA to classify restaurants into four types, highlighting the heterogeneity of our findings. Findings While elite endorsements motivate peers to contribute, excessively increasing elites can be seen as manipulative, discouraging customer opinions. We also identify an inverted U-shaped pattern in elite impact on subsequent peer review novelty, where increasing elites limit topics, hindering novelty. Research limitations/implications Future research should assess our findings’ generalizability in other geographical locations and cultures. Practical implications Our findings help managers find the right balance in elite engagement, maximizing the benefits of elite recommendations while avoiding elite saturation and audience fatigue. Managers should carefully assess their elite recommendation strategies, emphasizing trust, authenticity and individuality within their audience. This ensures companies do not over-rely on elite recommendations, leading to a more effective and sustainable strategy. Originality/value This study addresses an identified need; that is, how elites’ past opinions influence peers’ future opinions, uncovering the potential inhibition effects of elites on the quantity and novelty of peer-generated content.",

          "authors": "Jianyu Chen, Pengfei Du",
          "abstract": "Purpose Despite the prevalence of service failures in this emerging livestreaming e-commerce domain, scholarly investigations have neglected the effectiveness of livestreamers’ online coping strategies in mitigating the dual consequences of sales attrition and reputational impairment after these failures. Based on the stress and coping theory, this research aims to examine the underlying mechanism and boundary condition through which livestreamers’ online expressive coping strategy influences the recovery process of viewers’ electronic word-of-mouth (WOM) in the livestreaming e-commerce failure context. Design/methodology/approach We employed a two-wave time-lagged survey to mitigate common method bias and control for spurious mood effects, thereby enhancing the robustness of our findings. Our sample comprised 222 Chinese viewers who recently encountered service failures in livestreaming e-commerce. Analytically, we adopted a two-stage partial least squares structural equation modeling approach to validate a moderated-mediation model. Findings Livestreamers’ online expressive coping strategies exert a positive influence on viewers’ perceived livestreaming e-commerce failure severity, which in turn negatively impacts their electronic WOM. Viewers’ online trust in livestreamers intensifies this negatively mediated relationship. Practical implications This study provides practical implications for stakeholders to enhance livestreaming e-commerce failure recoveries through effective online expressive coping strategies while recognizing the potential downside of viewers’ online trust in livestreamers. Originality/value This study advances the understanding of livestreamers’ online expressive coping strategies in the livestreaming e-commerce failure recovery process and uncovers the dark side effect of online trust in the livestreaming e-commerce context.",

          "authors": "Blythe Guest, Maxime Levasseur, Zachary W. Petzel",
          "abstract": "Abstract: Despite the proliferation of equality-focused actions on social media, such as the Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements, discrimination is still prevalent on these platforms. While confronting prejudice may reduce future discrimination (i.e., counter-speech), several factors limit confrontation within face-to-face interactions (i.e., social costs, perceived effectiveness, self-efficacy). Intervention is also more likely when others’ actions are driven by situational factors (i.e., external attribution) than stable features of personality (i.e., internal attributions). Yet, whether these antecedents of face-to-face confrontation parallel online confrontation is unclear. Participants ( N = 120) viewed a sexist or neutral social media profile manipulated to be consistent or inconsistent (i.e., facilitating internal and external attributions, respectively) and were asked to respond to the user’s recent post. Inconsistently sexist profiles were more likely to be confronted than consistently sexist profiles. However, participants exhibited more effort in responding (i.e., number of characters) to sexist than neutral prompts, regardless of the user’s consistency. Higher self-efficacy increased confrontation of sexist profiles, with larger effects emerging for inconsistent sexist behavior. Contrary to expectations, heightened social cost (i.e., perceived risks of confrontation) increased response effort for sexist profiles. These counterintuitive results indicate cognitive appraisals for online counter-speech might differ from face-to-face confrontation, potentially driven by partial anonymity, physical distance, and temporal delay of feedback observed in social media interactions. While results provide partial support for the role of attribution and individual differences for online confrontation, additional research is needed to understand antecedents of counter-speech on social media.",

          "abstract": "Integrating aspects of social interaction and communicating via technology, this study examines perceived support as a mechanism through which frequent interactions with support providers are linked to depression. Building off of Taylor and Bazarova’s (2018) developments to media multiplexity theory, it also theorizes and tests the moderating effect of multiple forms of media multiplexity, including average multiplexity, overall multiplexity, and multiplexity variability. Survey data from N = 946 U.S. adults recruited through an online panel in April 2020 showed that interaction frequency with support providers was negatively associated with depression through perceived support. This mediating effect of perceived support was further moderated by media multiplexity, such that it was stronger when individuals on average used more channels in interactions with each of their support providers and when their channel use manifested a high level of heterogeneity across their network. Conversely, it was weaker when the total number of channels used across providers was high. The findings extend media multiplexity theory and contribute to understanding social interactions and computer-mediated communication.",

          "abstract": "Working as a married couple in the same workplace has its own unique and different aspects. This situation can be a challenging and difficult experience for couples and may also cause discomfort for other stakeholders in the workplace. Although its prevalence in Turkey is not clearly known, there has been an observed increase in married couples’ demand to work in the same workplace. The purpose of this qualitative research is to examine the experiences of married couples working in the same workplace. For this purpose, we conducted interviews with 14 participants (4 = male, 10 = female) aged between 32 and 50. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data obtained from the interviews and as a result, three main themes were identified: “Invisible costs”, “Support and solidarity”, “Professional relationship”. We believe that the findings of this study will contribute to the literature on the feelings and experiences of married couples working in the same workplace and finally, we offer recommendations to couples, employers and organizational psychologists.",

          "abstract": "Pet ownership and interactions with pets might influence humans’ positive affect and interactions with other humans. Some evidence suggests that there is a positive link between pet ownership and humans’ romantic relationship and friendship quality, but there has been very limited research. This experiment investigated the immediate and subsequent effects of pet presence and interactions with pets on adults’ positive facial emotional display and mood while they interacted with their romantic partner or friend ( n = 164; 74 in romantic couple dyads and 90 in friend dyads) compared with a control object (stuffed dog toy). A standardized behavior coding tool developed for human-animal interaction research (OHAIRE-v3) was used to analyze the video data. The results showed that pet presence was linked to more positive facial expressions compared with stuffed animal toy presence, which seemed to be a short-term effect for those interacting with a friend and to have a lingering effect for those interacting with a romantic partner. The largest differences in positive facial expressions were observed between pet owners who had pet presence and non-pet owners who had toy presence, while there were smaller differences between pet owners who had pet presence and pet owners who had toy presence. Moreover, pet presence was linked to increased mood only in those interacting with a friend. The exploratory findings suggest that the cognitive presence of a pet might potentially still affect humans’ emotional displays while interacting with romantic partners, while the physical presence of a pet could have a more substantial effect on emotional displays. Participants’ perceived interactions with the pet during the experiment were positively linked to their facial expressions, while their observed interactions were not. Limitations of the existing measures and potential importance of pets’ interactive behaviors toward humans are highlighted.",

          "abstract": "This article begins by conceptualizing Google Maps Review and its commenting apparatus as a distinct communication (sub)-platform (GMRsP) of Google Maps, which revolves around review sharing (writing and reading). Then, by combining structural and post-structural narratological frameworks, we describe GMRsP design and affordances, and conceptualize their potential for shaping emergent user activity and platform dynamics. The unpacking of meanings and possible implications of GMRsP’s affordances illuminates the intricate inter-relations between the platform socio-technical design and the contents of its reviews. This stresses the reviews’ evaluative narrative function and suggests a spiraling communication design, where the (sub)-platform’s narrative functions may alternately shape different points of entry for various Google Maps sites’ reviews and experiences. The study’s theoretical contribution includes informing future critical empirical and theoretical studies of reviewing/commenting platforms, stressing the types of participatory roles they provide and the effects they may have; and advancing platform studies by highlighting the emergent relations between sub-platforms and platforms.",

          "abstract": "The role of time in game development has seen increasing study, but the role of time in creating gaming ‘content’ has rarely been explored. To explore how time is strategised and rationalised by content creators, I examine how game streamers on Twitch navigate dynamics of time and temporality in their broadcasts. Through semi-structured interviews, this article reveals complex and dynamic decision-making processes in the seemingly simple decision of ‘when to stream’, highlighting the interplay of geography, game genre, game community, and life commitments. I demonstrate how three main factors – pragmatics, discourses, and happenstance – combine to shape game streamers’ thinking about temporal elements of streaming. The article thus unpacks the multi-layered dynamics of these decisions, and how live streamers’ broadcasts become structured and routinised over time, which inevitably shapes and drives both the creation and the consumption of video content on the platform.",

By adopting a mixed-methods approach of quantitative trend analysis and secondary qualitative research of government narratives, we identify four different types of shutdowns including Internet blackouts, network shutdowns, platform blockages, and Internet slowdowns. Our findings reveal Ethiopia experienced a systematic escalation of shutdowns, transitioning from sporadic disruptions in the early periods of our data sample to sustained, highly targeted interventions by 2023–2024. We found official government narratives portray shutdowns as “necessary” measures for public safety, linking cyberhate and misinformation to real-world violence. We argue the Ethiopian case underscores the usefulness of a nuanced approach to digital sovereignty in Global South contexts where shutdowns are used ambivalently as reactive tools to mitigate platform failures in content moderation while also lending themselves to political control and expressive repression.",

          "authors": "Lucia F. O'Sullivan, Charlene F. Belu, Lucia Tramonte",
          "abstract": "This study examined individuals who had an active agreement to be exclusive with their relationship partner but who also reported romantic or sexual attraction to someone outside of their relationship (a “crush”). We tracked participants over time, measuring attraction intensity and relationship quality, to help clarify when an extradyadic attraction might challenge the quality of the primary relationship in some way. Of 567 individuals ( M age = 28.52; 55.4% women; 82.2% heterosexual) who reported an extradyadic attraction, 172 (30.3%) completed all assessments and maintained their primary relationship over a one‐year period. We used HLM and cluster analysis to examine patterns of associations among these 172 participants and to capture typologies for extradyadic attraction. Overall, many harbor attraction to people outside of their relationship with no corresponding harms noted in that primary relationship, regardless of whether that attraction varied or was stable in its target. However, some had extradyadic attractions that were linked to decreases in primary relationship romantic and sexual satisfaction over time, especially among those whose relationship quality was lower at baseline. The findings have implications for researchers, counselors, and educators invested in supporting couples and for understanding relationship maintenance processes generally.",

          "abstract": "Intercultural couples experience various distinct challenges and are tasked with learning how to effectively approach such challenges by capitalizing on their unique benefits. This study sought to explore the lived experiences and challenges of intercultural couples while they co‐create a third culture using semi‐structured interviews of 10 participants. Qualitative analysis proposed a narrative, beginning with the complex onset, followed by distinct conflicts, and culminating with bridging the gap. The findings could perhaps inform culturally sensitive interventions that seek to support intercultural couples.",

          "authors": "Katie N. Adams, Christopher R. Agnew",
          "abstract": "Some people are single despite desiring a committed romantic relationship. Past research has revealed relationship maintenance strategies—thoughts and behaviors that couple members enact to fuel overall relationship satisfaction and commitment—associated with relationship stability. From two independent samples totaling 2059 single young adults desiring a committed relationship, we assessed whether individuals know that given maintenance strategies are beneficial to long‐term relationship stability (maintenance response‐efficacy) and whether they feel they can implement these strategies in their relationships (maintenance self‐efficacy). We used the newly developed PRIME (Perceptions of Relationship Maintenance Efficacy) to measure these concepts and test several preregistered hypothesized associations. Results revealed that participants, on average, were knowledgeable about the importance of and felt efficacious regarding enacting most strategies. Both maintenance response‐efficacy and self‐efficacy were associated with the duration of recent past romances when scores were combined, but only self‐efficacy was significant when examined independently. These findings highlight the importance of assessing relationship maintenance efficacy among singles seeking a committed romantic relationship. PRIME is also the first relationship maintenance self‐report measure that does not require individuals to be in a relationship for assessment.",

          "authors": "Jade Vrielink, Rens Vliegenthart, Annelien van Remoortere, Sanne Kruikemeier",
          "abstract": "Online advertising is an important component of political campaigning. With microtargeting techniques, voter groups who have shared concerns about specific issues can be identified and, subsequently, targeted with posts addressing those issues. This paper aims to provide an initial investigation into the dynamics and effects of targeted issue ads. We study whether these targeted persuasion efforts influence which issues matter to voters and, vice versa, if voters are more likely to receive ads about issues that they deem important. We take a comparative approach by collecting data in the run-up to the 2021 Dutch general election ( N = 103) and during the 2022 United States midterm election ( N = 31). To test the effects of ads that individual voters were exposed to during these times, we use a novel combination of methods, namely, mobile experience sampling, screenshot data donations, and content analysis. In both countries, we find that exposure to online ads increases the salience of issues among voters. We did not find evidence for successful targeting on issue preferences in the United States or the Netherlands. We discuss possible explanations and implications of these findings.",
