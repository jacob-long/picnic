          "abstract": "We review 4 decades of scholarship on the relationship between social disorder and social interaction generated by the Washington school of the ethnography of communication. We identify 5 key insights from the review regarding the ontological status of social disorder, the multiple scales of disorder, the mutually constitutive relationship between disorder and interaction, the dialectical relationship between order and disorder, and social disorder’s historically and politically contingent character. Our review invites scholars working in the sociocultural theoretical tradition to approach social order and disorder as scalar phenomena, to view social order as subject to contestation, and to rethink the relationship between social interaction and disorder as the result of scarcity, excess, design, or lack of communicative competence.",

          "abstract": "This contribution introduces the comprehensive framework of epistemic welfare to discuss how public service media (PSM) can engage with algorithmic recommender systems in a manner in keeping with PSM's foundational principles. We contextualize PSM algorithmic recommenders in their tradition of content curation and discuss the challenges PSM face in implementing these systems. We introduce epistemic welfare, a framework based in social epistemology and welfare studies, defined as concerned with creating and maintaining conditions and capabilities for epistemic agency of citizens in the public sphere. We discuss the epistemic standards of reliability, power, fecundity, speed, and efficiency and illustrate the framework's operationalization for the design and implementation of recommenders and its relevance for governance by and of PSM's algorithms. Ensuring that algorithmic recommender systems fit epistemic welfare, we argue, allows PSM to help tackle the epistemic disruptions in the digitalized public sphere.",

          "abstract": "The heightened concern about political polarization, and the growth of radical parties in many national contexts have had various effects, such as eroding trust in democratic political systems. This article aims to study political polarization exploring one of its main causes, the polarizing communication of political elites. By coding the various components of polarizing strategies identified in the literature (partisan identity and issues, attacks against others, incivility), we analyze the polarizing strategies used in the campaign for the 2024 European parliamentary elections by all Italian leaders and parties. We consider parties and leaders’ messages on Facebook and Instagram, also looking at followers’ engagement. This study tackles a simple research question: which parties and leaders choose to polarize? The results show that challenger parties tend to polarize more than dominant parties.",

          "abstract": "The belief in the capabilities of one’s own group is crucial for joining collective action aimed at addressing large-scale societal crises like climate change. Drawing from the two-step flow of communication theory and behavioral models of collective action, we conducted two experimental studies and an innovative quasi-experimental field study (total N = 2,960). Across these studies, influencer messages increased collective response efficacy beliefs and political action intentions, particularly among followers with strong parasocial ties. Moreover, repeated exposure to an influencer’s message reinforced these effects. Our research underscores the potential of influencers in mobilizing collective political action within digital media environments.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The integration of artificial intelligence in workplaces is rapidly transforming employment structures, skill requirements, and decision-making processes. This study examines how AI-mediated workplaces (AI-MWP) impact STEM trainees entering the workforce. Specifically, it explores their preparedness, the challenges and opportunities presented by AI-MWP, and the role of socio-digital skills in shaping their career trajectories. Design/methodology/approach This study employs a socio-technical systems (STS) approach to analyze the experiences of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) interns. Using qualitative research methods, including interviews and case studies, we investigate how AI-MWP influence information sharing, task allocation, workplace interactions and the professional development of recent graduates. Findings The findings highlight that AI-MWP introduce new challenges for STEM trainees, particularly in navigating socio-digital skills, workplace autonomy and task ownership. AI-mediated communication reduces informal learning opportunities, impacting trainees' ability to develop professional networks and contextual understanding. Revealing a growing gap in employability frameworks that fail to address the evolving socio-technical demands of modern work, the study also underscores the necessity of digital fluency, adaptability and interdisciplinary collaboration as essential competencies for thriving in AI-MWP. Originality/value This study extends STS thinking into the AI-mediated work domain, offering new insights into how digital transformation reshapes employment dynamics. By identifying socio-digital skills as a critical yet overlooked component, we provide actionable recommendations for STEM educators and employers to improve training strategies and bridge the gap between academic preparation and AI-MWP.",

          "authors": "Li Ji, Yitong Wang, Huanyi Zhao, Ling Jiang, Xingyu Chen",
          "abstract": "Purpose Paid knowledge products have become prevalent on online platforms; however, consumers’ discontinued consumption has plagued paid knowledge platforms, and the factors affecting user discontinuance have not been fully investigated. This study examined how users’ post-usage attitudes toward knowledge products were associated with their discontinuance intention and how the associations were moderated by users’ goal orientations. Design/methodology/approach In this cross-sectional study, 352 users of paid knowledge products completed online surveys. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to examine the effects of post-usage attitudes and goal orientation on post-purchase discontinuance intention. Findings The results showed that users’ post-usage attitudes toward self-improvement were negatively associated with discontinuance intention, whereas users’ attitudes toward self-image and conformity to subjective norms were positively associated with discontinuance intention. Simultaneously, learning goal orientation weakened the negative relationship between self-improvement attitudes and discontinuance intention, whereas performance-oriented goal orientation strengthened the positive relationship between self-image attitudes and discontinuance intention. Originality/value This study advances the literature on paid knowledge consumption by identifying consumer post-usage attitudes driven by their pre-usage expectations, including self-improvement, self-image and conformity with norms. In addition, this study extends the expectation disconfirmation theory (EDT), which postulates a positive relationship between post-usage attitudes and user continuance by highlighting the intrinsic and extrinsic nature of user expectations as a boundary condition. Consistent with EDT, users with positive attitudes toward intrinsically driven self-improvement were less likely to discontinue their use. However, in contrast to EDT, users with positive attitudes about extrinsically driven self-image and conformity to norms are more likely to discontinue use. These findings have important implications for practitioners designing different paid knowledge products and retaining users with distinct expectations.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The rise of virtual influencers (VIs) has reshaped influencer culture, yet existing literature lacks a cross-cultural examination of how VIs foster engagement from media communication and fan perspectives. Notably, factors influencing VI-fan engagement remain underexamined, leading to inconsistent findings and a critical knowledge gap. This study aims to address this gap by identifying overlooked determinants of VI-fan interactions, thereby enhancing such engagement both in China and globally. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-method approach, integrating content analysis and statistical analysis, was employed to compare fan engagement among top Chinese and global VIs, with theoretical grounding in the information adoption model and the eWOM narrative model. Findings The study identified the specific effects of platform differences and content types on VI-fan engagement. Additionally, it developed a content typology tailored to enhance such engagement, offering actionable insights for optimizing VI-fan engagement. Practical implications It provides detailed guidance on brand management for VIs, aiding in strategic decisions such as VI design, platform selection and content curation to strengthen fan engagement, whether for Chinese or global VI campaigns. Originality/value It fills a key literature gap by providing cross-cultural evidence on VI-fan engagement – an area previously marked by insufficient and inconsistent findings. Its focus on comparative analysis between China and the global context adds unique value, addressing the lack of cross-cultural analysis in existing studies.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: Although research suggests that popular media can shape adults’ perceptions of scientists, studies with younger audiences remain scarce. In this preregistered online experiment, children aged 8–12 ( N = 256) viewed an animated television program that featured women who varied in their character role (i.e., superheroes vs. supervillains) and character description (i.e., labeled vs. not labeled as scientists). Children reported high levels of epistemic trust in scientists overall. However, viewing a villainous woman who was labeled (vs. not labeled) as a scientist led to slight reductions in epistemic trust. Furthermore, habitual exposure to superhero television negatively predicted one dimension of epistemic trust (i.e., perceived benevolence). We discuss the theoretical implications of these findings and offer practical suggestions for content design.",

          "abstract": "The use of profile photos is central to most dating apps, yet some apps deliberately delay the display of photos. This study examines user experiences on pictureless dating apps, with a focus on Heymandi. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 Gen Z (i.e., 18–25 years old) users in Hong Kong to address three research questions: (1) what affordances motivate users to adopt pictureless dating apps, (2) how users self-present in a text-only environment, and (3) how relationships develop on this kind of apps. Findings highlight three key affordances: anonymity, which enables users to avoid stigmatization and prioritize personality over appearance; immediacy, which facilitates instant matching and real-time conversations; and specificity, which encourages users to initiate and respond to targeted discussions. Users employed three self-presentation strategies—self-promoting, effortless, and interest-based—to create appealing text-only profiles. Relationship development followed a three-phase process: matching, switching between social media platforms (e.g., transitioning from Heymandi to Telegram and/or Instagram), and, for most users, photo exchanges via other platforms prior to in-person meetings. While pictureless apps aim to reduce emphasis on physical appearance, photo exchanges reintroduced appearance-based considerations. This study sheds light on emerging dating platforms, revealing how they both challenge and reinforce traditional appearance-driven dating norms.",

          "abstract": "In a relationship-oriented society such as China, individuals’ development of college students in this country cannot be separated from the social support they receive and the social-emotional competence they possess. However, existing literature has not adequately explored the relationship between these two factors and their influencing mechanisms on individual development. To address this gap, we conducted a survey involving 3,840 college students from ten higher educational institutions in Henan Province and employed structural equation modeling to analyze this dynamic. The findings reveal that (1) Social-emotional competence significantly and positively predicts the level of social support received by college students; (2) Interaction culture and conflictual relationships exert significant effects on the connection between social-emotional competence and students’ social support; (3) our analysis indicates that compared to gender and educational stage as moderating factors, institution type has a more pronounced moderating effect on the relationship between students’ social-emotional competence and the social support they receive.",

While previous research has explored the impact of similar technologies (e.g., online pornography) as well as transactional sex within partnered relationships, this study seeks to understand how users who access camsites with their in-person romantic partner perceive how camming has affected their overall connection. As part of a broader study of 5,124 participants, a subsample of 312 participants who reported engaging in partnered camsite usage were asked to assess their partnered camming interactions. Overall, a third of participants reported using a camsite with a romantic partner, with 56% using a camsite with their partner multiple times. Motivations were diverse but especially centered on a desire to ‘spice up the relationship’ and to ‘try something new’. Participants largely reported that the experience had a positive or neutral effect on their relationship, with improved sexual communication, greater understanding, or less awkwardness as a byproduct of using a camsite together. By exploring both an emerging sexual technology and a novel context of its use, this study provides necessary insight into how such technologies may shape romantic relationships and offers pathways for enhanced connection, particularly in the context of sexual intimacy.",

          "authors": "Eran Katz, Eran Bar-Kalifa, Paula Pietromonaco, Hodaya Wolf, Robert Klempfner, Hanoch Hod, Noa Vilchinsky",
          "abstract": "Caregiving for cardiac patients is often accompanied by significant emotional and physical strain. While prior research has emphasized the contribution of support to mitigate caregivers’ burden, limited attention has been paid to the support they may receive from the patients themselves. Attachment theory provides a crucial lens for understanding individual differences in how this specific kind of partner’s support is perceived and utilized. Drawing on dyadic coping models and attachment theory, this study examines how support dynamics within the couple influence caregivers’ burden, and whether these effects depend on caregivers’ attachment orientations. Specifically, the study investigates whether caregivers’ attachment anxiety and avoidance moderate the associations between (a) patient-reported support provided to the caregiver (b) caregiver perceived received support from the patient, and (c) levels of caregiver burden during cardiac rehabilitation. Eighty-eight heterosexual couples, in which the male partner had experienced a recent cardiac event, were assessed at the beginning and end of a three-month rehabilitation program. Measures included self-reported support (provided and received), attachment orientations, and multidimensional caregivers’ burden. Overall support was not directly associated with reduced general burden. Caregivers high in avoidant attachment reported lower emotional burden when they perceived receiving greater support from their ill partner. No such effect was found among caregivers low in avoidance or those high in anxious attachment. These findings highlight the importance of considering both interpersonal and intrapersonal factors in understanding caregiver burden. Recognizing and addressing attachment-related patterns in caregiving dyads could inform targeted interventions aimed at reducing emotional distress and enhancing resilience in couples coping with cardiac illness.",

          "abstract": "The rapid growth of social media has prompted many corporations to collaborate with social media influencers (SMIs) to create sponsored personal stories to engage their consumers. While the positive effects of narrative transportation have been examined in the SMI context, its potential backfire effects are rarely explored. Through two online experiments, Study 1 ( N = 161) found that narratives (vs. non-narratives) resulted in less positive ad responses, with these effects fully mediated by perceived manipulative intent. Study 2 ( N = 257) replicated these findings and further revealed that sponsorship disclosure moderated these effects: disclosure exacerbates the backfire effects of narratives by heightening perceived manipulative intent, whereas in non-narrative ads, it enhances ad effects by reducing consumers’ inference of manipulative intent.",

          "authors": "Tin-Yuet Ting",
          "abstract": "Studies of contemporary social movements have explored the role of digital maps and mapmaking in the organisation and visualisation of protest events, yet little is known about the contentious political potential of maps when the political opportunities for street politics fade. This article examines the digital cartography of Hong Kong’s yellow economic circle, a networked system of retailers and consumers linked by political values that support pro-movement stores and boycott pro-establishment businesses, for which citizen activists amassed crowdsourced data to create and update counter-maps that galvanised political consumerism to uphold dissent. Drawing on a renewed conception of the networked movement scene, I contend that counter-data mapping demonstrates a connective structure of self-mobilisation that affords the (trans)formation of (a) dissent spatiality, (b) sociality, and (c) solidarity during the declining stages of movements. Based on digital ethnography and archival research, I show how this nascent cartographic data-as-repertoire not only helped establish and sustain a resistant economy but also allowed people to maintain and refashion their contentious political participation via everyday engagement with data. While the state authorities attempted to expand their territorial control amidst the crisis, counter-data mapping, as a digitally enabled, joint practice of scene-making, (re)invented dissent territory, enabling dispersed citizen activists to continue to connect and mobilise amidst intense urban policing and social distancing protocols. This article casts new light on the utility and capacity of digital cartography during movement latency while illuminating the understudied contours and consequences of counter-data mapping in a non-Western context.",

          "abstract": "This article explores the relationship between local media ecosystems and territorial hope in depopulated rural areas of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain). Drawing on geographies of hope as a travelling concept, we examine how local media shape affective orientations toward the future. Within the framework of rural mediatization, we conceptualize media ensembles as key drivers in the symbolic construction of place and as potential enablers of hope in territories historically marked by demographic decline. Approaching news deserts from the perspective of communicative resilience, we combine a media mapping of 721 depopulated municipalities with a face-to-face survey of 529 residents to analyze the role of local media in sustaining collective affective configurations. We construct an index of territorial hope based on three interrelated indicators: personal optimism, sense of belonging, and outward projection of the locality. Statistical analyses show that municipalities with more local media score significantly higher on this index, and a regression model confirms that media-related variables—especially interest in local news and trust in professional media—are stronger predictors of territorial hope than most sociodemographic factors. Our findings suggest that local media contribute to the emergence of territorial hope. This underscores the importance of integrating communication indicators into the study of geographies of hope and highlights their relevance to strengthen the symbolic agency of rural communities.",

          "abstract": "Nomophobia, characterized by anxiety when out of mobile phone contact, has emerged as a pervasive issue in this digital age, with negative consequences across various domains. Prior studies have been limited by reliance on cross-sectional designs that restrict causal inference and by insufficient exploration of the mechanisms linking nomophobia to developmental outcomes. This study addressed these gaps by employing longitudinal research designs to explore the effect of nomophobia on academic achievement and mental health, with a particular focus on the mediating effects of the I-self (e.g., self-control) and the Me-self (e.g., self-esteem). A sample of 499 secondary students completed the Nomophobia Questionnaire, Self-Control Scale, Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, and Kessler Psychological Distress Scale across three waves over 18 months. Structural equation modeling showed that after controlling for baseline levels, nomophobia negatively predicted self-control six months later, which in turn significantly predicted academic achievement another six months later. Similarly, nomophobia predicted subsequent self-esteem, which in turn predicted subsequent mental health. These findings provide longitudinal evidence of the detrimental effects of nomophobia and highlight the importance of the self-system processes. Altogether, this study underscores the need for interventions aimed at reducing nomophobia symptoms and strengthening self-system processes to support adolescents’ psychological development.",

This reflected Nokia's attempt to cater to an imagined youth demographic defined by playfulness and individuality. However, the feature was widely mocked, becoming a cultural meme and contributing to the commercial failure of the N-Gage. Using the concepts of designed identity and domestication, the article argues that sidetalking's failure was less about technological limitations and more about cultural misalignment. Nokia's inability to communicate the rationale behind sidetalking left it vulnerable to consumer reinterpretation through domestication. This analysis highlights the dynamic interplay between design, user reception, and the framing of innovation in how technology is contextualized.",

Analyzing 40 cases of mourning and memorialization practices across Facebook’s Profiles, Groups, and Pages, the study identifies three core components: a twofold engagement with time (calendric and discursive), temporal introspection, and temporal convergence. The calendric use of time involves specific dates that serve as temporal triggers for posting, while the discursive use describes how users embed time into their posts—through rich and repeated time expressions, poetic narration, and so on. Time becomes a communicative resource, not merely a contextual background but an active rhetorical and affective tool. Temporal introspection captures how social media platforms invite users to articulate their inner experience of time, and temporal convergence reveals how multiple temporal layers—personal and collective, offline and online—converge on a single platform, giving rise to new rituals and expressions.",

          "authors": "Sydney G. Wicks, MacKenzie Paul, H. Colleen Sinclair",
          "abstract": "Research has extensively examined how social network opinions (approval or disapproval from friends) affect romantic relationships. Friends are not the only ones to have opinions, yet there has been less exploration into whether one's friendship is influenced by opinions of the romantic partner. Balance theory suggests that individuals seek congruent attitudes within triads. Thus, this research (total N = 439) proposes that just as friend opinions (of romantic partner) impact romantic relationships, partner opinions (of friend) influence friendships. In Study 1, participants reported perceptions of a chosen friend's opinion of their partner and the partner's opinion of this friend. In Study 2, we manipulated opinion source and type using vignettes, assessing the hypothetical quality of relationships. Consistent with past research, friend disapproval was associated with lower romantic relationship quality. Uniquely, we found that perceived partner opinions—but not hypothetical ones—predicted friendship outcomes. Whereas friends' opinions did not appear to impact the friendship, partner opinion predicted romantic relationship satisfaction—revealing a potential social opinion backlash effect, whereby partners voicing disapproval of friends not only harm the friendship but also the romantic relationship. Findings suggest a bidirectional influence within networks for partners and friends, with expressing disapproval carrying added costs for romantic partners.",

          "abstract": "We describe a focus group study of public perceptions of “deepfake” technology, that is, digitally manipulated videos that show people saying or doing things they never really did. The study was designed to explore the relationship between degree of closeness to or familiarity with technology and attitudes toward it. We find that in this case, publics that are closer have more positive and nuanced attitudes. In such cases, at least, it appears that distance does not lend enchantment. We suggest why this may be the case and propose further related research designed to test the conclusions reached here.",

In a single-factor experiment ( N = 1,264), compared to lean narratives or statistics, rich narratives most effectively elicited fear through heightened transportation, although they did not outperform lean narratives in evoking guilt. Fear increased risk perception through reduced psychological distance and greater self-referencing; guilt was positively associated with both. Elevated risk perception predicted more favorable attitudes and stronger behavioral intentions. These findings offer theoretical and practical implications for science communication strategies to promote antibiotic stewardship and other health behaviors.",

A total of 1,392 participants in China completed a survey for this study. Results indicate that science belief significantly predicts both perceived threat and efficacy, which subsequently elicit the four correction behaviors. Multigroup analysis further revealed that the proposed science belief model varies by levels of interdependent self-construal. Among individuals with high interdependence, science belief exerted a stronger influence on perceived threat and efficacy, and efficacy more strongly predicted public correction and refutation behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Many individuals regularly use multiple social media platforms, and their information exposure is shaped by the various networks they maintain across these platforms. Given the rising trend of multi-platform social media use, this article introduces a two-step approach to investigate how networks across platforms conjointly and distinctly relate to incidental exposure to news and political information. Our analysis of survey data from the United States showed that greater immersion in multiple politically heterogeneous networks across platforms predicted higher counter-attitudinal incidental exposure, while greater immersion in multiple politically homogeneous networks across platforms predicted higher pro-attitudinal incidental exposure. Among the popular platforms, immersion in networks on Facebook, X (Twitter), and YouTube played a particularly influential role in these relationships. Surprisingly, we also found that greater immersion in homogeneous networks across multiple platforms predicted higher counter-attitudinal exposure, even though immersion in any single platform’s homogeneous network was not a significant predictor.",

          "authors": "Jennifer Ihm, Eun-mee Kim",
          "abstract": "What news spreads on social media equally depends on what news users do and do not share. However, prior research has predominantly focused on successful news sharing , overlooking the equally consequential behavior of deliberate news withholding. This study addresses that gap by proposing a self-presentation model of deliberate news withholding on social media, integrating three dominant approaches previously used to examine successful news sharing: (1) the informational approach focusing on the virality of news content, (2) the structural approach emphasizing social media network characteristics, and (3) the relational approach centered on users’ self-presentation and management of relationships with their audience. Specifically, this study combines two types of data: (1) survey data from 408 users and (2) a text analysis of news content they withheld in their three most active chatrooms. We examine how users selectively withhold news with varying levels of emotionality, argumentativeness, and hard or soft news value, depending on the characteristics of their audience networks – particularly network size and tie strength – and in relation to three self-presentational goals: self-construction, privacy protection, and audience-pleasing. Findings show that users strategically withhold varied types of news content across different user-audience networks to meet distinct self-presentational goals, thereby managing audience expectations and curating their online image. By shifting attention from news sharing to news withholding, this study offers a more complete account of how everyday users shape news flows and social discourse on social media.",

          "abstract": "Online hate messaging targeting Muslims and Jews increased dramatically following Hamas’s attack on Israelis on 7 October 2023 and Israel’s military response in Gaza. This study examined anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim hate posts on X.com and the verbal replies, Likes, and reposts they acquired over the following month. It tests a theory explaining the propagation of hate messages in social media based on the social approval posters garner from other users. The analysis involved replies to 6388 anti-Muslim or anti-Jewish hate posts in terms of their semantic convergence or divergence with the content of original posts. No differences between patterns of anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim discourse arose. Convergent replies to one’s hate posts led individuals to post more hatefully in their next post, and more quickly. Likes also accelerated hate posting, while reposts decelerated them. Divergent replies led to less hateful and slower subsequent hate postings. Conclusions address implications for the social approval theory of online hate, and the relative influence of verbal replies due to their costliness.",

          "abstract": "Guided by boundary work, this study aims to investigate how lifestyle journalism’s boundaries are changing in response to the rise of creator culture. Specifically, this study seeks to understand how lifestyle journalists define and perceive new creators in their profession and what kind of boundary-making strategies they enact in reaction to such new actors. Through 31 interviews with Singaporean lifestyle journalists, the findings show that there is currently a dynamic and evolving ecosystem of distinct digital lifestyle players comprising lifestyle journalists, digital natives, bloggers, key opinion leaders and influencers, and that the journalists perceive a complex ‘frenemy’ relationship with these actors. Lifestyle journalists engage in a combination of expansion, expulsion and protection of autonomy boundary strategies to guard their profession’s boundaries against the incursions of these new lifestyle actors, but there is a clear shift towards expansion-led strategies. Lifestyle journalists seem to be increasingly welcoming of both newer social media actors and practices into their profession, signalling that lifestyle journalism now exists in a digital reputation economy where online visibility, above all else, serves as the foremost marker of professional success.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces the concept of layered affordances to affordance theory, providing a framework for analyzing how digital platform affordances intersect and reinforce each other in facilitating technology-facilitated gender-based violence (TFGBV). Focusing on the #MeTooIndia movement and the Nth Room case in South Korea, we explore how multiplatform affordances, such as visibility, anonymity, and shareability, combine to create digital environments that enable the spread, reinforcement, and normalization of misogynistic narratives. In both cases, perpetrators strategically exploited layered affordances across platforms like X, Instagram, and Telegram to evade moderation, amplify harmful behaviors, and establish echo chambers of digital harm. This article argues that layered affordances reveal complex cross-platform dynamics that are crucial for understanding TFGBV and the ways in which digital harms are structured and sustained. Our findings highlight the need for nuanced, cross-platform governance policies that address the compounded nature of digital violence, particularly in non-Western contexts where marginalized communities are often most affected. By conceptualizing layered affordances, this study provides a crucial framework for analyzing the affordances that enable digital harms and for developing targeted interventions, thereby paving the way for more effective digital policy and platform design strategies.",

          "title": "Sad Dating Apps: Emotional Technological Determinism and Agency in Late Modernity",
          "authors": "Łukasz Szulc",
          "abstract": "Grim cultural diagnoses suggest that dating apps make their users feel sad, attributing this to the commodification of intimacy facilitated by digital technology. Dating apps are charged with offering an illusory sense of choice among abundant partners and providing tools for atomizing people and filtering through them, while many caution against the growing dependency on dating apps. Drawing on 30 interviews with Polish LGBTQ people living in the United Kingdom, this article challenges the conflation of dating apps with sadness by distinguishing between “sad dating apps” and “sad dating app users.” I show that users exercise complex forms of agency in recognizing the flaws of digital dating cultures and engaging with them creatively. I argue for research that moves beyond relatively privileged users and global dating apps to better understand the role of digital technologies in society, particularly at the intersection of emotions and agency. While Internet researchers have become more careful in avoiding technologically deterministic arguments when assessing technologies’ general impact or their “effects,” crude claims about how technologies make their users feel persist, which I refer to as emotional technological determinism. More broadly, my research not only underscores the greater agency of users in this respect but also delineates the forms, scales, and scopes of feelings, sometimes contradictory, that technologies provoke, which technologies provoke what feelings, and for whom. Emotions themselves can be more or less agential, and the agency over how one feels when interacting with technology is distributed between technologies, users, and contexts.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the role of TikTok as a platform-based crisis information source, focusing on how users engaged in collective sensemaking during the 2020 Port of Beirut explosion. Using a mixed-methods approach, the research analyzes multimodal content, including video, comments, hashtags, and transcripts, to understand how users’ holistic information experience influenced sensemaking around the crisis event. Drawing on Dervin’s conceptualization of sensemaking, the study investigates how visual, auditory, and textual elements of TikTok videos facilitate dynamic, iterative information behaviors such as information seeking, sharing, and negotiation. The findings stress how the platform’s recommendation system influences crisis sensemaking and the implications specifically for Middle Eastern crises. Our analysis revealed intersemiotic dissonance—the tension arising from clashing semiotic meanings—highlighting the risk of presenting crisis discourse multimodally.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how a special subset of Chinese journalists (those who focus mostly on an overseas audience) navigate and utilize U.S.-owned social media platforms, which are banned in China, in their daily newsroom practices. While previous research has primarily focused on digital news production and platformization in Western contexts, this study offers a transnational and sociotechnical perspective on how Chinese journalists negotiate platform logics (such as audience metrics and recommendation algorithms) while balancing state-driven narratives with global audience demands. Drawing on 26 in-depth interviews, the study zooms in on Chinese journalists’ constrained freedom associated with social media use: they benefit from access to large audiences but lack control over platform design and governance. These Chinese journalists often feel alienated from the platforms they rely on: journalistic labor is regulated by the Chinese state, while platform infrastructures are governed by U.S. tech firms. This study highlights how platformization in transnational journalism is shaped by the entanglement of technology, politics, and professional norms, extending our understanding of how platform power operates across geopolitical boundaries and offering a distinctive lens on the global unevenness of digital media systems.",

          "authors": "Hongli Zhou, Xudong Zhou, Jing Wang",
          "abstract": "Amid the profound transformations of rural society, traditional authorities and value systems are undergoing significant disruption. Mediated peer interactions among children are no longer merely a form of entertainment, but have become crucial arenas where they exercise agency and participate in shaping these changes. Grounded in the theoretical framework of the new sociology of childhood, this study presents an ethnographic investigation of HL Village. The findings reveal that the official evaluative system, represented by the school, has lost its effectiveness within the peer world. As active social agents, children reconstruct interactional spaces, reinvent social rules, and generate internal hierarchies through intensive mediated peer communication. In doing so, they establish an alternative value system centered on “media capital.” This dynamic creates a fundamental tension between the disciplinary logic of the adult world and the reconstructive logic of children’s peer culture. Based on these findings, the study argues that the agency children exhibit in mediated peer interactions is deeply ambivalent: while it challenges traditional authority, it simultaneously reproduces new forms of inequality and digital exclusion. Moreover, this mediated peer interactions offers a micro-level lens through which to observe rural social transformation, as its unique culture of interaction both reflects and contributes to broader structural shifts.",
