          "abstract": "Advertising research has increasingly applied construal level theory (CLT) to predict advertising effectiveness. This study systematically reviews and synthesizes CLT-based advertising research by focusing on the theoretical tenets of CLT, construal-level manipulations, and construal-level manipulation checks applied in this research domain. This is the first systematic review of CLT-based advertising research involving psychological distance, which is the distance from self, here, and now. The review identified 86 relevant articles published in top-ranked journals between 2009 and 2023, retrieved from seven electronic academic databases. It found that CLT-based advertising studies are primarily anchored on the theoretical tenets of matching effect, categorization effect, and psychological distance. It further identified and classified the construal-level manipulations used in CLT-based advertising research into three categories: psychological-distance dimensions, psychological manipulations, and marketing-related factors. Finally, this review highlights the critical gaps in existing research and offers avenues for future research.",

Using affordance theory, we analyze a university classroom, a collaborative virtual environment, situated in virtual reality (VR). Our longitudinal study spans 10 weeks and follows 15 participants who spent over 25 hours together in meta-space classroom habitats. To capture a wide range of conditions around VR affordances (avatars, embodiment, immersion/presence), we turn to spotlines, a method that combines various medialities, to compare and describe the temporal rhythms of VR habituation. Through sustained engagement in VR, this study reveals how meta-spaces function as habitats that foster avatar sociality, metalearning, and embodied moments of friction.",

          "abstract": "The study investigates which democracy dimensions impact the share of (foreign) media followers of European governments’ Twitter social media accounts. To achieve this target, a network analysis and a data-linking strategy are relied upon to conduct three multilevel regression models. The first model reveals that while overall government media attention is positively associated with gross domestic product and internet penetration, it is negatively associated with higher levels of deliberative democracy. The second model, which focuses specifically on the share of foreign media followers, finds that individual-level factors are the primary predictors of foreign media attention. The third model explores the country context of media followers and indicates that government accounts benefit from followers in countries with higher democratic standards and greater media freedom, though there are negative associations with certain democratic dimensions such as liberal and participative democracy. Additionally, ministers and ministries consistently have a higher proportion of foreign media followers compared to heads of state. These findings are discussed in light of the literature on Twitter's role in media attention and gatekeeping theory.",

          "authors": "J. Patrick Williams, Mark R. Johnson, Vinay Kumar",
          "abstract": "Esports-relevant expertise extends beyond gameplay to encompass the cultivation of knowledge, skills, networks, and resources that support competitive success. Using a grounded theory approach and insights from 33 interviews with esports players in an emerging ecosystem, this study develops a sociocultural model that identifies four interrelated dimensions shaping expertise development, while paying special attention to the challenges players face. C ultures represent the layered structures of meanings, values, and norms that influence practices within and around esports. Social relations highlight families, schools, peers, and other social actors that support and/or inhibit gaming pursuits. Minds address social-psychological dispositions, mindsets, and the interpersonal dynamics that impact expertise. Finally, resources foreground how finances, space, time, and emotions enable or constrain players’ growth. Together, these dimensions reveal the multifaceted and interconnected ecology surrounding esports-relevant expertise development. The article highlights the value of an inductive approach for generating new and novel insights, and offers a valuable framework for understanding the sociocultural factors influencing esports-relevant expertise.",

The research presented included two stages. The qualitative stage aimed to apply the concepts from the fields of ludology and interaction design to interpret the play experience in selected gamebooks. This part resulted in research notes describing the interaction process with each puzzle in analyzed gamebooks. The result of the analysis of those notes is the proposition of the typology of riddles and puzzles present in those books and a general reflection on the puzzle-solving process structure. In the second part of the project, we intended to apply the typology to address research questions of a quantitative nature related to puzzle uniqueness, dissemination of particular puzzle types, and similarity of design practice between authors.",

          "abstract": "Purpose In the current digital business landscape, businesses heavily rely on their information technology (IT) departments to drive digital transformation initiatives. However, firms often face challenges in obtaining sufficient backing from their IT departments for such initiatives. This research explores the influence of IT departments’ intellectual capital, referred to as IT intellectual capital, on digital transformation under varying degrees of market turbulence. Design/methodology/approach A survey was employed to collect data from 296 IT managers and business managers from 148 firms in China. We used the seemingly unrelated regression to test hypotheses. Findings This study indicates that each category of IT intellectual capital – namely, IT human capital, structural capital and social capital – contributes positively to digital transformation. IT social capital mediates the effects of IT human and structural capital on digital transformation. Besides, market turbulence amplifies the effect of IT human capital on digital transformation, whereas it diminishes the influence of IT social capital on digital transformation. Practical implications Practitioners need to recognize the strategic role of IT intellectual capital in advancing digital transformation and develop appropriate IT intellectual capital according to the market environments in which the firm operates. Originality/value The study introduces novel perspectives on the antecedents of digital transformation and enhances the intellectual capital literature by revealing the influence of different types of IT intellectual capital on digital transformation under various levels of market turbulence.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Social media-based brand communities (SMBBCs) have emerged as one of the most significant marketing tools due to their ability to create and maintain close relationships between SMBBCs and consumers. However, past studies have ignored intimacy toward SMBBCs, particularly the role of individual variances in their development. Researchers have revealed the significant impacts of individual differences in attachment styles on the development of brand–consumer relationships based on attachment theory. Accordingly, this study aims to explore the drivers of intimacy toward SMBBCs from the perspective of attachment theory. Design/methodology/approach This study examines a proposed model that integrates two attachment styles – attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety – self-disclosure on social media and intimacy toward SMBBCs through two samples in the context of brands’ Facebook fan pages. Findings The results show that attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety have significantly negative and positive effects on self-disclosure on social media, respectively, which contribute to intimacy toward SMBBCs. Practical implications The results offer brand managers significant implications for segmenting markets and developing relationship marketing strategies for their brand communities on social media. Originality/value This study is the first attempt to explore the driving factors of intimacy toward SMBBCs from the attachment theory perspective.",

In this study, four experiments were designed to compare the performance of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and human judges in detecting deception from linguistic cues in a dataset of 62 transcriptions of video-taped interviews (32 genuine and 30 deceptive). The results showed that machine-learning algorithms significantly outperform naïve (accuracy = 54.7%) and expert judges (accuracy = 59.4%) when trained on features from the reality monitoring (RM) and cognitive load frameworks (accuracy = 69.4%) or on features automatically extracted through NLP techniques (accuracy = 77.3%) but not when trained on the RM criteria alone. This evidence suggests that NLP algorithms, due to their ability to handle complex patterns of linguistic data, might be useful for better disentangling truthful from deceptive narratives, outperforming traditional theoretical models.",

          "abstract": "Netflix is often credited with mainstreaming binge-watching through its release strategy and interface features. However, despite this reputation, data on actual consumption patterns remains scarce, enabling Netflix to shape the narrative about how content is consumed on its platform and what this implies about content quality and viewer attentiveness. This article provides unique empirical insights into Netflix viewing patterns in the Netherlands, based on a pilot study involving data donated by 126 subscribers. It introduces a definition of binge-watching tailored for computational analysis and offers an empirical understanding of its prevalence and manifestations. The findings suggest that binge-watching is a diverse and complex activity. While it is seemingly popular, in that it is practiced by many subscribers, the data suggest it occurs less frequently and is less extreme than would be expected from the hype.",

          "authors": "Christine Linke, Lisa Brune",
          "abstract": "True crime is a highly controversial yet successful entertainment genre that is widely available on streaming, video, and podcast platforms. The content often includes visual depictions of victims and survivors of gender-based violence, as well as depictions of the acts of violence themselves, such as surveillance footage, police or court videos, or photographs. Additionally, producers and account holders on social media platforms frequently use stereotypical, clichéd, and even eroticized representations of violence. True crime formats rarely address neither the structural causes and backgrounds which lead to crimes, nor the impact on victims, survivors, and their relatives. To address these issues, we apply audio-visual content analysis, focusing on the YouTube channel of Bailey Sarian and her content combination of narrating true crime stories while doing her makeup. Drawing on communication and media studies, we explore the dual tenor of subversive-empowering versus voyeuristic-exploitative representations in the context of narratives of gender-based violence. Our analysis highlights that the unreflective and voyeuristic tone of commercialized true crime narratives can lead to the unethical exploitation of real events and the people affected. The Murder, Mystery &amp;amp; Makeup Monday series exemplifies a dual approach, blending affective storytelling, which fosters viewer intimacy, with sensationalistic portrayals that often simplify and stigmatize those involved in criminal cases. Although some empowering and informative voices regarding gender-based violence exist online, they are frequently overshadowed by the sensationalism typical of commercial true crime. The series underscores a tension between intimate engagement and ethical responsibility, shaped by platform-driven pressures that prioritize engagement over quality. Our findings emphasize the need for platforms to actively enable nuanced, balanced portrayals that foster a more informed and empathetic media environment.",

          "authors": "Frédérique Khazoom",
          "abstract": "This article focuses on Netflix’s local-language strategy, the context leading up to it, and the extent to which transnationality, in this particular case, becomes televisual in John Caldwell’s sense. I argue that Netflix has developed a different business model for transnational TV formats through this strategy. For that, I use the Netflix original and exclusive series &lt;em&gt;Criminal&lt;/em&gt; (Field Smith &amp;amp; Kay, 2019–present-a–d) as a case study and show that its production context triggers a specific visual response due to Netflix’s economic and legal obligations in Europe. Building on the “transnational TV format trading system” approach of Jean K. Chalaby, this case study highlights how the affordances of multi-country video-on-demand providers like Netflix allow for the successful international franchising strategy in linear television to be conducted internally and simultaneously. Specifically, it shows that fictional TV series no longer need to be developed for a national broadcaster before reaching international markets because multi-country video-on-demand providers do not require various national intermediaries to distribute and stream TV series in different markets. The adaptation process can also be bypassed entirely if the decision to localize a programme into multiple versions is made before production starts. As a result, companies like Netflix can produce several local variations of TV content without running into as many barriers as national broadcasters. From there, I further argue using Mareike Jenner’s “grammar of transnationalism” that the impact of production and distribution processes on the visual treatment of &lt;em&gt;Criminal&lt;/em&gt; leads to style excess at the interface level and stylistic scarcity at the aesthetic level.",

          "abstract": "Why do people tend to rewatch series and films when they have numerous new options at their disposal? This article develops the notion of rewatching on streaming platforms as an essential and enduring aspect of televisuality. Our analysis draws from diary reports completed during one month by 40 streaming platform users in Costa Rica, as well as focus group conversations with 13 of these participants. We examine rewatching as a pursuit of &lt;em&gt;ontological comfort&lt;/em&gt;, that is, the sense of well-being derived from people’s understanding of everyday life and their conscious capacity to act in it. We argue that rewatching expresses an active search for stability, predictability, and orchestrated surprise through the narratives and conventions of certain televisual genres and the self-schedule affordances of streaming platforms. This study thus examines the nuanced significance of rewatching and its fundamental connection to the notion of comfort.",

          "abstract": "This analysis uses a media industry studies approach in conjunction with Caldwell’s concept of “televisuality” to explore the significance of cultural authenticity within Netflix’s industrial discourses. The authors argue that Netflix’s emphasis on cultural authenticity in its global content strategies mirrors the concept of “televisuality” as a form of corporate behavior and cultural representation in the streaming era. Specifically, the findings demonstrate the ways in which cultural authenticity can be understood as an industrial practice, distinct from the specific textual, narrative, or genre-related elements of its content. In addition, this research finds that executives’ assertions about universal storytelling diminish the significance of cultural differences, enabling them to present this diluted version of cultural authenticity as a catalyst for fostering global empathy and understanding. Yet, the broader utility of conceptualizing cultural authenticity as the overarching industrial logic of contemporary streaming television remains unclear as a result of Netflix’s distinctive position within the industry.",

          "authors": "Viljami Vaarala",
          "abstract": "The legitimacy of journalism as a truth-teller has become contested during the era of digitalisation and newly emerging platforms. Recently, the epistemic authority of legacy journalism has been challenged by right-wing podcasting. This article explores metajournalistic discussions on the identity of legacy journalism as a truth-oriented practice and institution in six Finnish podcasts published independently outside legacy media on YouTube. This metajournalistic discourse of truth is identified through topic modelling in 229 podcast episodes, of which 119 are scrutinised using qualitative discourse analysis. The discursive articulations in the YouTube podcast episodes are assessed in the light of realist and antirealist philosophies as well as epistemic theories of journalistic truth structured by critical realist and pragmatist philosophies. The results show that the epistemic authority of legacy journalism is challenged through three interconnected themes through which legacy journalism is articulated as an antirealist practice and institution. By contrast, YouTube podcasting is framed as a platform for a balanced, authentic, and uncut talk that realises the epistemic ideals of journalism. The challenges to the epistemic authority of legacy journalism presented by the Finnish YouTube podcasts are also similar to those identified in previous research on right-wing podcasting and online counter-media. The findings point to the need for legacy journalists and podcasting practitioners to adopt more nuanced and context-bound understandings of journalistic knowledge and truth structured by critical realist and pragmatist philosophies.",

          "abstract": "This article investigates – based on semi-structured interviews and conversations on cryptoart forums – how digital artists experience the blockchain-enabled assetization of their work through non-fungible tokens, including the transformation of digital artworks (which previously had negligible if any economic value) into assets capable of increasing in price value over time and generating future income from resale provisions. We show how this assetization of digital artworks has kindled artists’ financialized imagination and incentivized them to perform speculative labour – that is, to speculate on the potential capture of future financial proceeds from present-day underpaid or uncompensated activities, while mobilizing fictional expectations of imagined rentiership futures. We suggest that the commodification thesis, which has traditionally explained the future orientation of creative work as tied to commodity exchange, may be insufficient to account for artists’ speculative, asset-based imaginations of the future under financialized capitalism. Therefore, it may be beneficial to complement it with an assetization lens.",

          "abstract": "Given the number of identified risks associated with influencer sharenting, momfluencers are increasingly adopting a more mindful approach to sharing information about their children online. Prior qualitative research suggests that followers respond positively towards these mindful sharenting practices, especially when motives are communicated. However, there is a lack of experimental exploration into this finding and its potential explanations. Therefore, drawing upon theoretical insights regarding self-disclosure and self-determination theory, this experimental study with 176 mothers seeks to investigate the impact of momfluencers providing an explanation regarding mindful sharenting practices, proposing the need for relatedness and empathy as mediators. The findings reveal that when momfluencers disclose their motives, this significantly enhances follower engagement, admiration, and evaluation of the momfluencer. This effect is fully explained by empathy, and partly by the need for relatedness. This study emphasizes the importance of transparency and provides momfluencers strategies to balance privacy protection and the benefits of influencer sharenting.",

          "abstract": "Prior reviews suggest that premarital pregnancies are deleterious to couples' relationship quality and stability. However, outcomes of premarital pregnancy may be confounded with socioeconomic factors. Study 1 (1) compared demographically matched premaritally pregnant and nonpregnant couples on partners' recalled courtship trajectories of commitment to marriage and milestone occurrence (e.g., first sex, feeling love) and marital outcomes (satisfaction and disillusionment); (2) examined how partners' commitment‐trajectory similarity was linked to their milestone attainment and marital outcomes; and (3) investigated how familism relates to premarital pregnancy and relationship progression. Using a predominantly Hispanic local sample, we compared 47 premaritally pregnant and 47 demographically matched nonpregnant newlywed couples on mean levels of key variables and on correlations among them. Pregnant and nonpregnant couples exhibited similar timing and correlates of milestone attainment. Partners' commitment‐trajectory similarity was more important for reaching milestones than was premarital pregnancy. Study 2 addressed Study 1's potential selection bias for highly stable couples (because all eventually married) by including only cohabiting couples from a national dataset. Findings likewise showed little difference in relationship quality between cohabiters with and without young children. Hence, researchers, practitioners, and policymakers should consider premaritally pregnant couples' full context of their romantic relationship rather than the pregnancy alone.",

We distinguish parallel mechanisms of interest evocation, that is, meta-emotional media gratification via the emotion of awe and eudaimonic media appreciation sequentially mediated by awe and awareness of knowledge gap. Moreover, perceived science self-efficacy moderated meta-emotional gratification. Findings suggest that awe-inspiring science media events may facilitate interest development by motivating information-seeking about science topics.",

          "authors": "Nathalie Van Raemdonck, Ike Picone, Jo Pierson",
          "abstract": "Social norms are flexible regulating forces of human behavior. They are shaped by humans, whose actions in turn are shaped by their environment, including the online social spaces they venture into. The objective of this research is to create an understanding of how the affordances of social media platforms shape social norm dynamics in online publics, particularly in climate change publics. For this purpose, we make a comparative analysis of the practices of users on Instagram and Twitter that engage with climate change content. We conducted 22 in-depth interviews with a purposively selected sample of worldwide Twitter and Instagram users. We investigated how each platform’s specific affordances shape the participants’ sense of community and how they participate in social norm enforcement and contestation, also called “callouts.” This “affordances-in-practice” perspective brings observations on the differences in how users can actualize the novel affordances of “interventionability” and “external visibility” on both platforms. This research provides a deeper insight into the socio-technical processes underlying the (self-)organization of social movements and provides a pathway to investigating discursive practices of online publics on other platforms. The study avoids debating which norms should prevail over others in the online climate discussion, but does reflect on the negative impact that certain outcomes of norm enforcement and contestation might have on democratic deliberation on climate change. The main findings are that actualizing these affordances on Twitter anno 2023 makes climate discourse sensitive to group-loyalties, whereas on Instagram it makes it dependent on norm leaders in the form of content creators.",

Compared to its predominant usage in SoMe research, our approach involves a perspective shift from what do SoMe users present (e.g., social role, identity/identities, idealized self, authentic self, brand) to how they perform it, concerning the style of acting and dressing, the use of props, makeup, symbols and signs, emotions, and expressions. Since participation on SoMe platforms is largely about how SoMe users present themselves and how they want to be received, theatricality and performing arts theories can inform this how with a new and nuanced conceptual apparatus. Therefore, we create a theory-based typology on the concepts of theatricality, simple and complex acting, not-acting, not-not-me, imagined audience awareness, and absorption. We present six types of theatrical self-presentations and conditions, types suitable for analysis of SoMe performances.",

          "authors": "Mariam Betlemidze",
          "abstract": "This article explores how ignorance becomes a cultural affordance of trans-platformization, focusing on the Renegade dance’s evolution into a viral sensation that fueled TikTok’s rise and launched new teenage influencers. Employing new materialist feminist theory, Actor-Network Theory, and Critical Technocultural Discourse Analysis, this article operationalizes the concept of trans-platformization. It examines race-technology entanglements as they manifest during trans-platformization, highlighting the illusory progress in recognizing Black creators and the resistance against a predominantly White, techno-capitalist patriarchy. The tensions arising from these complexities intensify the demand for a more nuanced understanding of ignorance as the affordance of trans-platformization and the potential pivot point for speculative hope.",

          "authors": "Hongxun Zhao, Jiahui Wang, Xurui Hu",
          "abstract": "In the era of ubiquitous mobile internet, Chinese youth are engaging in dual pursuits of knowledge and employment through various social media platforms, showcasing unique social media practices. Via semi-structured interviews with 14 platform-swinging youth and NVivo12-assisted three-tier qualitative analysis, this study reveals the psychological mechanisms behind their “wandering” behavior. Spontaneous engagement, fulfillment of needs, resonance with peers, preservation of meaning, self-management, and intermittent swinging characterize youth’s complex wandering online activities. It further explores new dimensions of youths’ media practices, emphasizing subjective expression, identity reconstruction, boundary clarification, and visibility control. Moreover, wandering youth also encounter challenges like context collapse, losing their true selves, and self-pulling, which raises a critical question: Where will they wander?",

          "authors": "Nuurrianti Jalli",
          "abstract": "This study examines the use of TikTok as a platform for youth activism in Southeast Asia, focusing on Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Through a mixed-methods approach that includes qualitative content analysis, semi-structured interviews, systematic fact-checking, and digital trace data, the research explores how activists leverage TikTok’s unique features to promote social justice and mobilize political participation amid democratic backslidings. The findings reveal that activists skillfully adapt to TikTok’s attention economy, using strategies like trend-jacking and meme creation to reach broad audiences. However, they also face significant challenges, including rampant harassment and the precarious nature of algorithmic visibility. The study highlights the complexities of digital activism, where the pursuit of virality can sometimes undermine the depth of political movements. While the research counters the prevalent narrative that digital activism is rife with misinformation, it underscores the importance of maintaining accuracy to protect credibility. The study concludes by calling for further research on integrating online activism with offline organizing and exploring how platform governance can be reformed to better support activists. The insights from this study contribute to a deeper understanding of TikTok’s role in contemporary social movements and the challenges faced by youth activists in the digital age.",

          "authors": "Bridget Barrett, Shannon C. McGregor",
          "abstract": "Studies on digital advertising effects claim that the primary purposes of online ads are persuasive: They seek to change vote choice or voters’ attitudes toward candidates. But recent scholarship has noted that social media’s unique affordances encourage electoral campaigns to use them in specific ways, such as using Facebook’s ads for email list-building. We conceptualize such strategic campaign goals as instrumental purposes of advertisements. We develop novel measures to test these instrumental effects. In an online survey experiment using Facebook ads from the 2020 Biden and Trump campaigns, we test our theory with list-building, fundraising, and persuasion ads. In a factor analysis, we find that instrumental and persuasive effects are related, but distinct, aspects of candidate support. We also test the effects of these ads on persuasive and instrumental outcomes. Our control treatment was an ad for a can of Progresso soup. We found no main persuasive or instrumental effects of any advertisement type. These ads performed no better than soup.",

          "abstract": "Critically engaging with the prevalent theses of “platformization” and “infrastructuralization” in the mainstream platform studies literature, this empirical study identifies socio-economic actors and examines their relations in digital governance mediated by data-driven platforms in the Chinese context. Through a case study of “the digital reform” in Zhejiang Province, and the affiliated smart city project—City Brain—in Hangzhou, the municipal capital, this study draws on data from participatory observations and interviews to (1) provide a historical context, in which “platformization” in urban governance is aimed to serve market-oriented socio-economic reforms; (2) argue that such “platformization” is shaped by the long-standing structural tension between centralization and localism, which has been renewed by digital data flows; and (3) understand the shifting public–private demarcation in social interactions and arrangements to deflect continual frictions between the state, local agents, and platforms in the domain of digital governance.",

          "authors": "Yufan Guo, Yuzhe Lei",
          "abstract": "Despite the increasing reliance on online media for news consumption, people generally exhibit lower levels of trust in online news relative to traditional media. To explain the preference disparities in media trust and their potential cross-national variations, this article examines individuals’ trust gap between newspapers and Internet news across 14 countries and regions in East, South, and Southeast Asia. Drawing on nationally representative data and other country-level data (2018–2021), we test two underlying mechanisms, political trust transfer and alternative information orientation, that account for the media trust gap, as well as their boundary conditions. Multilevel analysis reveals that political trust positively correlates with people’s relative trust in newspapers, which is pronounced in societies with lower levels of polarization and limited press freedom. Besides, using the Internet and social media as the main channels of political information seeking may increase people’s relative trust in Internet news, especially in societies with higher levels of press freedom and political polarization. Our findings offer systematic explanations for news trust preferences by combining political characteristics and their contextual conditions, which have implications for understanding today’s media trust crisis.",
