          "authors": "Daniel C Hallin, Philip Kitzberger, Manel Palos-Pons",
          "abstract": "This article examines seven Latin American cases in which anti-populist media played central roles in organizing political opposition to a populist regime, creating a political cleavage between populism and anti-populism which continued to structure both journalism and political competition following the end of populist rule. It contributes to the literature on media and populism by focusing on an actor usually neglected in this literature—the anti-populist media—and by shifting the focus from press freedom to political parallelism. Following the case studies we take up conceptual issues related to the logics of populism and anti-populism and to debates about the applicability of the concept of political parallelism and of mediatization to Latin America and other regions of the global South.",

          "authors": "Ruthie Abeliovich, Ido Ramati",
          "abstract": "Intermingling new and old media, this article introduces the concept of phonographic theatricality to explore the performativity of human-machine vocality. It jointly discusses the theatricality of historical and new sound media: media principles that characterized the phonograph in its emergence are still evident in the speech of contemporary AI-voice agents. Phonographic theatricality is a cross-media concept describing the conditions, playfulness, contingencies, and implications of the actualization of pre-recorded voices. It covers a broad range of cases in which a machine injects a human sounding voice into a situation, usually acousmatic in its detachment from a human body, yet performing as a theatrical agent. The analysis demonstrates how sound media theatricalize truthfulness, fidelity, illusion, and trickery as part of their mediation of voices, and how humans and machines mingle in producing phonographic theatricality. Three historical dramas, as well as contemporaneous newspaper articles, caricatures and ads, unveil the rise of phonographic theatricality as a media principle, inviting and affording a discussion on the performativity of AI voices. When machines speak and laugh in human voices, they become actors, vocally reshaping the space in which they operate, charging it with theatricality.",

          "title": "Band of blood brothers: Exploring visibility management and networking among Twitter users identifying as Filipino men living with HIV",
          "authors": "Aldo Gavril Lim, Cleofe Torres, Sarah Cardey, Anna Macready, Maria Stella Tirol",
          "abstract": "The Philippines continues to grapple with a rising number of HIV cases, particularly among Filipino men who have sex with men. Notably, Filipino men living with HIV (FMLWH) are visible on Twitter (now X), despite Facebook’s dominance in the Philippines. The Twitterverse of FMLWH may be imagined as networked publics, with these users negotiating visibility management in the face of HIV-related stigmas and navigating context collapse in a high-visibility space. In this study, we explore the visibility management practices of Twitter users identifying as FMLWH and subsequently map their network structure. Our mixed-methods approach combined analysis of online trace data from 1447 public Twitter accounts with in-depth interviews conducted with 24 Twitter users. Findings revealed that FMLWH employed a range of visibility management practices on Twitter, including the use of succinct identifiers to disclose HIV status, the maintenance of pseudonymous identities, and a strategic shift from partial to greater visibility when engaging with other FMLWH in private communication spaces. Participants expressed a strong inclination to connect with fellow ‘blood brothers’ and were frequently directed to these users through algorithmic recommendations rather than word-of-mouth. An expansive network comprising 302,934 ‘follow’ ties connected all but two of the 1447 users. Network analysis also showed high reciprocity and short distances between actors. Despite these metrics, a relatively low degree of interconnectedness was found, suggesting that users formed their own smaller pockets of conversation. Overall, FMLWH exhibited a deliberate effort to manage their visibility on Twitter and demonstrated a level of connectivity and engagement that might not naturally occur in real-world settings. Furthermore, the affordances of Twitter facilitated the open disclosure of HIV status, traditionally considered a private and sensitive matter. These findings warrant further investigation into the formation of networked HIV social identities and the emergence of pseudonymous networked counter publics among FMLWH.",

          "abstract": "Guided by social identity gratification theory, this study examines the reciprocal relationship between media consumption and social identity among 220 ethnically and linguistically diverse Muslim American adolescents over three years. Using latent growth curve modeling, we found stronger evidence for media-to-identity influence, particularly in predicting within-person changes over time. Media consumption was significantly associated with identity centrality and private esteem but not public esteem, highlighting the multidimensionality of social identity. The impact of media also varied by genre and language: native-language entertainment media positively influenced identity centrality and private esteem, whereas English-language media showed distinct effects at the between- and within-subject levels. Additionally, increased time on social networking sites was linked to a decline in Muslim private esteem over time. These findings highlight the complex ways media consumption shapes the social identity development of marginalized youth in the United States.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The metaverse presents an emerging domain that offers many opportunities to various stakeholders. Despite the advantages, the metaverse has been witnessing increasing cases of violence and abuse. This study aims to empirically examine the dark side of the metaverse and its consequences on users. Design/methodology/approach The study uses the theoretical premise of deindividuation theory and psychodynamic theory to conceptualize a research model. A structured survey-based questionnaire is employed for data collection from 327 metaverse gaming users from US. Structured equation modeling was used for data analysis. Findings The study reveals that the loneliness of users is positively associated with dissociative anonymity and invisibility in the metaverse, which leads to deindividuation. Further, findings suggest that deindividuation fosters deviant behaviour in metaverse. Furthermore, deindividuation and deviant behaviour predict depression among users. The study also established the moderating effects of immersive experience. Originality/value Rarely studies have attempted to comprehend the dark side of the metaverse. The study is one of the first to empirically show that metaverse engagement might aggravate the well-being of lonely individuals. Findings also offer implications for metaverse game designers and public policymakers.",

          "authors": "Aaron van Klyton, Juan Tavera-Mesias, Kevin Duque, Ahmed Agyapong",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study explores the intricate relationship between trust dynamics and AI implementation in high-barrier environments within emerging economies. It investigates how government involvement, organisational leadership, managerial competence and organisational readiness collectively shape trust in AI implementation capability (TOIC). By examining these interactions, the research aims to provide a nuanced understanding of how government involvement influences trust within the firm. Design/methodology/approach The study employs a conceptual framework grounded in the technology-organisation-environment (TOE) model, combined with a multilevel trust perspective. Data were collected through a survey of 412 information technology and information and communication technology (IT/ICT) firms and analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). This approach enabled the identification of key relationships and moderating effects between trust determinants and AI implementation. Findings Three key insights emerged: (1) Government involvement indirectly influences trust by enhancing organisational readiness but can reduce trust when perceived as intrusive; (2) Top management support serves as a critical trust driver by shaping organisational readiness and aligning AI strategies with operational realities and (3) Managerial competence mediates trust development by translating strategic goals into operational practices, particularly in environments with high perceived barriers. Research limitations/implications The study focuses on IT/ICT firms in Ghana, potentially limiting generalisability. Future research should explore these trust dynamics in diverse emerging markets to validate the findings and expand theoretical insights into AI adoption in high-barrier contexts. Practical implications The findings underscore the need for governments to foster organisational readiness through training and infrastructure development rather than direct intervention. For business leaders, investing in top management support and managerial competence can enhance trust and facilitate successful AI adoption. Social implications By clarifying the trust-building mechanisms for AI implementation, this research supports the development of policies that balance technological innovation with societal trust, ultimately contributing to more inclusive and sustainable technological progress. Originality/value This study extends the TOE framework by integrating trust as a core factor in AI implementation and highlighting the moderating effect of barriers. It offers practical insights into the paradoxical role of government involvement, demonstrating that trust in implementation capabilities is contingent on strategic alignment between policy initiatives and firm-level capabilities.",

Based on empowerment and value co-creation (VCC) theories, this study innovatively classifies VCC into four dimensions and explores how PDE influences platform trust (PT) through VCC. Design/methodology/approach To examine our proposed research model, 400 valid questionnaires were collected and analyzed from sellers on CBEC platforms. Findings The empirical results reveal the mechanism by which PDE strengthens PT through VCC. Specifically, PDE significantly facilitates VCC activities between the platform and sellers and enhances the level of seller trust in the platform. The interdependence formed by VCC enhances PT, and it partially mediates the relationship between PDE and PT. Research limitations/implications This study provides theoretical support for promoting the transformation of PDE to PT through effective VCC on CBEC platforms and extends empowerment theory, VCC theory and trust field. The results provide valuable guidance for sellers to leverage PDE as a driver of win-win cooperation and development through effective VCC with the platform. Originality/value Previous research has focused on consumers’ views of e-commerce and developing practical solutions to enhance their confidence in participating in online transactions while lacking sufficient understanding of sellers’ demands on the CBEC platform. We address this gap in the literature by exploring the mechanism of how PDE influences VCC and PT from the seller’s perspective.",

          "authors": "Aishwarya Deep Shukla, Jie Mein Goh, Laksh Agarwal",
          "abstract": "Purpose Online reviews shape consumer decisions, even in healthcare, a credence service where expertise is difficult to evaluate. Like unethical retailers, some healthcare providers post fake reviews. However, the impact of fake reviews on potential patients remains unclear. Using a dataset of fake reviews, this study examines how patients perceive the helpfulness and trustworthiness of fraudulent vs genuine physician reviews. Design/methodology/approach We used an archival dataset containing a representative sample of 5,000 online physician reviews, both fake and genuine, and performed empirical analysis. In addition to the helpful votes obtained from the data, we used large language models to derive the perceived trustworthiness score. Findings Fake physician reviews are paradoxically perceived as more helpful and trustworthy than genuine reviews. To unravel the underlying mechanism, we investigated the extent of personalized and specific health information. We found that fake reviews often contain more personalized and specific health information, making them appear more credible. Research limitations/implications Results may not generalize beyond online physician reviews. Future research could extend this investigation to other contexts. Practical implications Online platforms may need to reconsider their approach to managing online reviews, address ethical concerns, and strengthen regulatory oversight in sensitive areas, particularly in healthcare. Originality/value This study highlights an ethical paradox: while patients seek detailed health information, privacy concerns limit real patients from sharing such details, creating an information gap that fake reviews exploit. This is the first study to make use of unique data that contains real fake online physician reviews.",

          "authors": "Rebecca M Rice, Kirstie McAllum",
          "abstract": "Discussions of risk in qualitative research tend to focus on risks to research participants. However, qualitative researchers also face risks—or uncertainties with potential for harm—because they serve as the research instrument. Communication researchers are uniquely suited to problematize the meaning of risk and extend theory about what risk is by noting that risk is subjective and communicatively constructed, both in qualitative methods and in research contexts. We create a typology of five risk contexts that pose a danger to researchers: crisis, disruptive, vulnerable, emotionally risky, and ethically fraught contexts. For each context, we define the risk, propose representative examples, and critically discuss proposed coping strategies. By doing so, we make three key contributions to scholarship on qualitative methods in communication research: (1) we explore how communication concepts of temporality, care, and resilience can be extended via discussion of researcher risks; (2) we show that researcher risk is ongoing, fluid, and constantly evolving; and (3) we argue that risk management strategies must include collective support that embraces the extended temporality of researcher risk.",

          "abstract": "This essay forward the theory of memorable messages (ToMM), a framework useful for examining the messages that individuals remember for long periods of time (i.e., memorable messages) and their influence on identities, beliefs, and behaviors. The ToMM empowers researchers to ask how messages deemed unhelpful, harmful, or incomplete (e.g., absent) can be disrupted, or meaningfully transformed, to make room for new messages and meanings. To this aim, we first overview 40 years of atheoretical memorable messages scholarship, before detailing recent advancements in the ToMM. Next, we offer warrants for five propositions of the ToMM, aligning with metatheoretical assumptions for an interpretive approach to memorable messages scholarship. Lastly, we discuss future directions for ToMM scholarship, including opportunities to advance qualitative approaches to communication research and approach the ToMM from alternative metatheoretical perspectives.",

          "authors": "Hyeonchang Gim",
          "abstract": "Positive mediated intergroup contact improves intergroup relations. By examining such effects in the foreign-language film context with varying verbal delivery methods, the study explores outgroup characters’ language accommodation to viewers as a critical mechanism. This experiment ( N = 204) investigated how different verbal delivery methods in a foreign language movie featuring Asian Americans (titled Minari ) influenced attitudes toward Asian Americans. Among native English speakers in America, watching the film with a native speaker's English dubbing (vs. foreign-accented English dubbing vs. foreign language with subtitles) led to more positive attitudes toward Asian Americans, mediated by two theory-driven mechanisms: perceived similarities and processing fluency with the target Asian American character. Results indicated that exposure to the target Asian American character in the native speaker's English dubbed (vs. subtitled) condition resulted in more perceived similarities with the character and fluent processing of the character's speech. Subsequently, these factors translated into positive evaluations of the character and Asian Americans as a group. With an emphasis on the role of language accommodation to viewers, theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

          "authors": "Diana Camila Garzón-Velandia, James W. Pennebaker",
          "abstract": "Three studies developed and validated a linguistic dictionary to measure negative affective polarization in English and Spanish political texts. It captures three dimensions: negative affect, delegitimization, and political context. In the first study, two independent judges evaluated the candidate words, and reliability indicators were calculated, showing acceptable values for short texts (.572 in English, .541 in Spanish) and higher values for larger corpora (.964 in English, .957 in Spanish). The second study tested discriminant validity by comparing negative affective polarization scores in social media comments on politics and entertainment. Results showed significantly higher polarization scores in political content, confirming the dictionary's validity. The third study compared the dictionary to an existing online polarization measure, finding greater coverage and alignment with the construct. Additionally, it was observed that polarization scores were higher in texts containing hate speech compared to those where it was absent. The findings suggest that the dictionary in both languages have strong psychometric properties, making it a valuable tool for analyzing online content, particularly social media comments. It can be used as an independent measure or as input for machine and deep learning models.",

          "authors": "José María Santos Rovira",
          "abstract": "This article embarks on a detailed exploration of Lisbon's evolving linguistic landscape, focusing on a specific neighborhood shaped by mass tourism and migration. Lisbon, traditionally considered a monolingual society, has experienced significant linguistic diversification due to globalization, making it an ideal context for studying how languages coexist and interact in urban spaces. Drawing from linguistic landscape research and sociolinguistic theories, this study examines how Asian immigrant communities, alongside international tourists, contribute to the city's dynamic linguistic environment. Our data collection, conducted through a combination of conversational interviews and photographic analysis, resulted in a corpus of 143 signs from a neighborhood densely populated by Asian immigrants. We show that the neighborhood's linguistic landscape is not just shaped by practical communication needs but also reflects deeper socio-cultural dynamics, such as identity preservation and economic adaptation to tourism. This research contributes to the growing field of linguistic landscapes by analyzing how immigrant languages, local languages, and global languages coexist and influence each other in Lisbon. It highlights the challenges and opportunities posed by globalization in urban environments and suggests pathways for fostering greater linguistic inclusivity and intercultural dialogue in multicultural cities like Lisbon.",

          "authors": "Cixin Wang, Pingping Xu, Juan Liang, Feiran Zhang, Beilei Li",
          "abstract": "This study sought to examine whether emotional resilience mediated the relation between victimization and depression, and whether friendship (quality and quantity) and gender moderated these relations among middle school students in China. Data were collected from 765 middle school students (seventh and eighth graders, Mage = 13.14 years) from three middle schools in Beijing, China in November 2019 (T1) and November 2020 (T2). Results showed that emotional resilience at T2 mediated the relation between victimization at T1 and depressive symptoms at T2 (indirect effect = 0.10, 95% CI [0.06, 0.14]). Friendship quality at T1 moderated the relation between victimization at T1 and emotional resilience at T2 ( β = 0.16, p &lt; .05), and served as a buffer for girls, but not for boys. Friendship quantity at T1 moderated the relation between T1 victimization and T2 emotional resilience at T2 ( β = −0.09, p &lt; .05), particularly for boys. Additionally, friendship quantity at T1 moderated the relation between T1 victimization and T2 depression ( β = 0.04, p &lt; .05), especially for girls. Specifically, slope analysis showed that having more friends was protective for resilience and depression only for students who experienced lower levels of victimization, but not for those who experienced higher levels of victimization. Furthermore, the three-way interaction term between T1 friendship quality, T1 friendship quantity, and T1 victimization significantly predicted T2 emotional resilience ( β = 0.11, p &lt; .05). Our findings clarified the effect of friendship quality versus quantity for Chinese youth who experienced victimization. The findings highlighted the importance of fostering high-quality friendships and emotional resilience to support the well-being of students who experienced peer victimization.",

          "authors": "Katya Santucci, Melanie A. Dirks, John E. Lydon",
          "abstract": "Friendship plays a critical role in well-being across the lifespan, making it important to understand the dissolution of these relationships. Friendships end in many ways and for many reasons, which may result in different social and emotional outcomes. In this review, we examine the rapidly burgeoning literature on friendship dissolution from childhood through young adulthood, detailing current understanding of how common friendship dissolution is, as well as why and how it occurs. Research has documented that during childhood and adolescence, friendships are markedly unstable, although little work has examined friendship stability in adulthood. Characteristics of individuals (e.g., behavior, interpersonal cognition), friendships (e.g., homophily, quality), and the contexts in which friendships are embedded (e.g., friends’ broader social networks) have all been linked to friendship stability. We document the diversity of ways in which friendships end, highlighting differences in timing, communication, and intent. Finally, we discuss circumstances under which dissolving a friendship may be helpful versus harmful. Future work should focus on elucidating friendship processes – that is, the positive and negative interactions that occur between friends – that contribute to dissolution, as well as developing interventions that promote the development and maintenance of high-quality friendships. Other critical research agendas are understanding friendship maintenance and dissolution among youth and young adults from marginalized groups and elucidating the ways in which technology may both strengthen and weaken friendships.",

          "abstract": "This study applies Relational Dialectics Theory (RDT 2.0) to examine the dominant and marginal discourses surrounding the speculum on Weibo in China and how these discourses compete to make meaning of the speculum object. Through contrapuntal analysis, we explore how two discourses—the centripetal discourse, “Speculum is Scientific and Beneficial” (SSB), and the centrifugal discourse, “Speculum is Regressive and Detrimental” (SRD)—interact and compete across three contractive practices, two types of synchronic interplay, and two forms of dialogic transformation. Our research broadens the application of RDT to non-Western stigmatized health contexts. Additionally, the current research deepens our understanding of the unique characteristics of digital platforms and their role in facilitating discourse competition, while illuminating broader social tensions around health, gender, and power in the context of women’s health in China, highlighting the complexities and constraints of public discourse on these issues.",

          "authors": "Jocelyn Lai, Marcela C. Otero, Kuan‐Hua Chen, Jenna L. Wells, Robert W. Levenson, Barbara L. Fredrickson",
          "abstract": "Positivity resonance is a collective emotion experienced by two or more individuals during moments of shared positive affect; it is theorized to constitute the experience of love, yet this claim has not been empirically tested. Using archival data from 148 long‐term married couples, we examined whether dyad‐level indicators of positivity resonance are linked to dyad‐level indicators of trait and state love. Trait love was assessed as a latent variable using partners' ratings of their spouse on validated adjectives prototypic of love (e.g., affectionate, warm) and previously validated nonverbal cues of love displayed in synchrony (i.e., head tilts, body leans, Duchenne smiles, and nodding) during a recorded spousal interaction. State love was assessed as synchronous nonverbal cues of love during successive 30‐s segments of this interaction. A global measure of positivity resonance, as well as measures of its constituent components of co‐expressed and co‐experienced positive affect (but not physiological linkage), were positively associated with the latent index of trait love. Within‐couple variation over time in the global measure of positivity resonance was associated with within‐couple variation over time in state love. These findings provide initial support for convergent validity between the measures of positivity resonance and love at trait and state levels.",
