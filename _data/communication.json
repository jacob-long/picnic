          "authors": "Renan Petersen-Wagner, Jan Andre Lee Ludvigsen",
          "abstract": "The penetration of social media platforms in the cultural production and consumption circuits of sport mega-events means that organisations like the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) are afforded new and alternative channels to engage with their audiences. TikTok, one of the largest platforms, is characterised by a higher degree of playfulness and humorous content and has been used to mobilise audiences for prosocial political aims. Using TikTok’s Research API access, this article relies on automatically collected metadata from all IPC posts between May 2023 and May 2024. After consolidating and manipulating the data through Python, statistical analyses were performed on SPSS to understand how certain content becomes more visible on the platform. In a second stage, videos with most virality underwent visual discourse analysis. We hold that the IPC, to challenge invisibilities, arguably one of the biggest obstacles for disability sport, engages in the circulation of humorous content with the aim of promoting inclusion and social change for persons with disabilities. While TikTok and the circulation of humorous content afford the IPC wider visibility to new audiences, it might provoke unintended consequences through further stigmatisation of disability sport as non-serious activity.",

          "abstract": "Should fanfiction forums be considered an instance of Digital Heritage Communities? Departing from the mainstream approach according to which Heritage Communities relate to intangible goods or material collections of Cultural Heritage Institutions (CHIs), we rather focus on the creative and cultural participatory assets enhanced by the advent of digital media (such as fanfictions) and the online communities (resp., fandoms) that support them. Here, we study by means of computational techniques the case of the Archive of Our Own (AO3), an Internet forum created and managed by fanfiction writers willing to share their work with a global fandom community. We find that AO3 cultivates a prosocial relational atmosphere that favors the emergence of stable sub-communities committed to writing, reading and enriching fanfictions as a shared cultural resource (a commons). Such features align with those outlined as characteristic of Heritage Communities, while emerging around a yet undervalued form of ‘born-digital’ cultural assets.",

          "abstract": "Emotions-as-practices involve an open, embodied, and meaning-making process as digital technologies can shape and transform how emotions are enacted. This study uses the concepts of emotional affordances and affective practice in digital culture to investigate the online emotional experiences of Chinese left-behind women living in a rural location. From an analysis of Douyin (TikTok) video posts and interviews with 18 participants, the study develops a notion of ‘ambivalent positivity’ manifested by overt conviviality and the repressed negativity of distress and separation. Furthermore, rural women are obligated to maintain the norm of positivity that is deeply intertwined with their gender roles and social relations. These practices are evident in and through Douyin use, such as beauty filters, streamlined video editing, and background music. Responding to the ambivalence of positivity, we argue that social media empower rural women to achieve positive self-representation; however, they remain constrained within social-cultural conditions as left-behind rural women in a patriarchal society. Findings contribute to understanding how interactional offline-online contexts shape dynamic emotional experiences.",

          "authors": "Martina Skrubbeltrang Mahnke, Joëlle Swart, David Mathieu, Pille Pruulmann-Vengerfeldt",
          "abstract": "Ongoing societal datafication and, most recently, the widely noticed launch of ChatGPT, continue to raise the “user question”: what role(s) does the user play in datafied, artificial, and automated environments? Recent technological advancements have begun to challenge fundamental assumptions in media and communication theory and, thus, urge scholars to (re-)visit and (re-)examine the interrelations, dynamics, and entanglements of (human) users with datafied environments. Two rapidly expanding but still largely distinct bodies of research are addressing these topics: critical data and platform studies, primarily focusing on structural approaches, and user-centered perspectives anchored in the tradition of audience research. Situated at the intersection of studying platform power and user agency, the aim of this special issue is to connect structural approaches with studies of lived user experiences through the lenses of reflectivity and reflexivity. We believe that linking platform and data perspectives dealing with questions of power, accountability, and governance on a societal level to users’ engagement with digital technologies and automated systems in an everyday context is a fruitful path when aiming for a comprehensive understanding of the societal implications of the widespread adoption and integration of digital platforms and intelligent technologies. The concepts of reflectivity and reflexivity provide a valuable conceptual starting point for a more integrated and holistic discussion of the complex user-data relations emerging in and from datafied environments. While the individual contributions in this special issue present their own take on the proposed concepts, the purpose of this introduction is to establish a broader theoretical foundation by outlining some overarching considerations on how these concepts can be understood and integrated.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The study compares the effects of creativity and digital nativity, with the latter signifying proficiency in digital skills, on enhancing innovation among employees. The research specifically evaluates the impact of creativity and digital nativity on general innovative performance and personal innovativeness using IT (PIIT). Design/methodology/approach Two studies were conducted. Study 1 surveyed 497 individuals on Prolific using objective measures of general innovative performance and self-report measures of PIIT. Study 2 replicated the same research design on Amazon Mechanical Turk with 336 participants and other-rated measures of PIIT. Findings Results were consistent across both studies and showed that creativity influenced general innovative performance more than digital nativity. However, digital nativity was a stronger predictor of PIIT, above and beyond the nonsignificant effects of creativity. Research limitations/implications This study helps understand the roles that digital nativity and creativity play in general innovative performance and in IT-related innovative performance by providing a relative importance analysis of these components. Practical implications We offer guidance to organizations on how to select individuals and assign them to particular tasks depending on digital or general innovative task requirements. Originality/value This is the first study to examine the direct comparison of creativity and digital nativity. Although the literature highlights the importance of digital nativity for innovation, our research reveals that creativity is more important for general innovative performance.",

Design/methodology/approach The data were gathered by conducting an online survey ( n  = 476) from young adults exposed to fashion retail metaverse platforms. The collected data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings The findings discovered that social presence dimensions positively impact CBE, which substantially impacts the PI of young consumers in the fashion retail metaverse. The findings demonstrate that self-efficacy moderates the relationship between CBE and PI. Research limitations/implications This study uses cross-sectional data in the fashion retail metaverse for young consumers. Future studies can use longitudinal data in the context of other industries and demographic profiles to assess changing customer behavior. Practical implications This study implies that customer experiences can be enriched through social presence dimensions, helping brands adapt their offers to create more engaging and rewarding customer interactions. It offers insights for brand managers aiming to augment the relationship between CBE and PI. Originality/value The study uniquely explores the relationship between social presence dimensions and CBE within the fashion retail metaverse.

          "abstract": "Purpose The aim of this paper is to explore the relationship between digital transformation and corporate fraud. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses panel data of Chinese listed corporations from 2010 to 2021 and captures digital transformation from the perspectives of awareness and investment by extracting related content from annual reports. Our work investigates whether and how digital transformation influences corporate fraud and examines the moderating effects of the legal environment, media environment and privacy concerns. Findings Our findings show that digital transformation, captured either from awareness or actual investment, can significantly alleviate corporate fraud. Our results are robust in a set of endogeneity tests and robustness checks. Additionally, we confirm that digital transformation alleviates corporate fraud through two mechanisms: improving internal monitoring and boosting information flow. Additionally, this alleviating effect is more pronounced for corporations with fewer privacy concerns and in worse legal and media environments. Practical implications Our findings provide insights for policymakers to motivate corporations to engage in digital transformation for fraud prevention. We also offer guidelines for corporations to improve their awareness and actual investments in digital transformation and take advantage of its governance effect in preventing corporate fraud. Originality/value Overall, we highlight the governance role of digital transformation in alleviating corporate fraud and provide policy implications for regulators in emerging economies to regard digital transformation as an effective tool for fraud prevention.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Given the urgency of corporate engagement in sustainable development, companies seek ways to involve their employees in sustainability efforts. In this regard, gamified systems have gained attention as a novel tool to promote sustainable employee behavior. However, as the research field matures, researchers and practitioners are confronted with a scattered academic landscape that makes it difficult to grasp how gamification can be designed to engage employees in sustainable behavior and to understand how gamification effects unfold at psychological, behavioral and corporate levels of sustainability. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses a systematic literature review to consolidate the existing knowledge on gamification designs and their effects on sustainable employee behavior. Findings Studies have explored a variety of utilitarian and achievement-, immersion- and social-related gameful affordances to promote positive behavior- and system-related psychological effects as a basis for employee engagement in sustainable behavior. However, the evidence regarding their impact on rational decision-making processes and overcoming the intention-action gap inherent in sustainability is still limited. Nevertheless, several studies in focused areas indicate the potential to elicit behavioral changes that drive sustainability outcomes at the corporate level as well. Originality/value Our study provides three main contributions. First, we develop a conceptual framework that illustrates how gamification can drive sustainable behavior in the workplace. Second, we derive seven agenda points to guide future research on gamification for corporate sustainability. Third, we deduce three practical approaches to use gamification as a strategic intervention to promote sustainable behavior in organizations.",

The present research employed a mixed-methods approach, beginning with a qualitative study to identify prevalent personality cues among users on metaverse social media platforms. Subsequently, a quantitative study was conducted to further validate the findings of the qualitative study. Findings The results indicated that avatar personality scored higher than the real-self personality in the dimensions of openness, conscientiousness and extraversion, while scored lower in the dimensions of agreeableness and neuroticism. Both real-self and avatar personality traits positively influenced metaverse satisfaction via behavioral engagement in the metaverse. Notably, avatar personality traits had a stronger impact on behavioral engagement compared to real-self personality traits, which further influence metaverse satisfaction. Practical implications The present study offers practical insights for metaverse developers and managers to enhance user satisfaction by focusing on users’ big five traits of both real-self and avatar personality. It suggests implementing personalized tools, organizing personality-based social activities and other initiatives to encourage user’s behavioral engagement and ultimately enhance metaverse satisfaction. Originality/value Unlike existing research that concentrates on a single facet of personality traits, this research employs a mixed-methods approach to conceptualize users' real-self personality and avatar personality, further exploring their impacts on metaverse satisfaction.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The metaverse, a virtual space where one can build and explore with others using avatars, is drawing global interest. Then questions arise: What drives consumers to customize their avatars and purchase virtual items in the metaverse? Who customizes and purchases virtual items more than others? To find the answers, this study tested a research model that explains why consumers customize their avatars and buy virtual items in the metaverse. Design/methodology/approach Based on the stimuli-organism-response model, this study posits that metaverse characteristics (i.e. escapism, visual attractiveness, social interaction and autonomy) arouse consumers’ curiosity toward the metaverse, which in turn evokes avatar customization behavior and virtual item purchase intention. Survey data from 501 metaverse-experienced consumers in both the US and Korea are analyzed. Findings The result revealed that all four metaverse characteristics were found to stimulate consumers’ curiosity. Consumers’ curiosity enhances avatar customization behavior and purchase intention of the virtual items. Further, avatar customization behavior increases the purchase intention of virtual items. Practical implications The findings provide valuable insights into how metaverse platforms can effectively engage consumers by stimulating curiosity, especially through social interaction, and offering extensive avatar customization options and virtual items. Originality/value This study highlights how the metaverse’s open-ended experiences, user-driven customization and social interactions – unlike traditional online games – spark consumer curiosity. It emphasizes the pivotal role of curiosity in driving metaverse engagement and highlights the need to consider it as a central construct in future research. Additionally, this study provides managerial implications for virtual item purchases in the metaverse.",

          "abstract": "Despite the potential of visual disinformation to deceive people on pressing socio-political issues, we currently lack an understanding of how online visual disinformation (de)legitimizes partisan truth claims at times of war. As an important next step in disinformation theory and research, this article inductively mapped a wide variety of global visual disinformation narratives on armed conflicts disseminated via social media. The narratives were sampled through various international fact-checking databases, involving multiple social media platforms and countries. The analyses reveal that visual disinformation mainly consisted of existing footage that was decontextualized in a deceptive manner based on time, location, or fictionality. Moving beyond existing research exploring how decontextualized visuals offer proof for counter-factual narratives, our findings indicate that visuals contribute to the process of othering by constructing a “delusional rationality” that legitimizes mass violence and the destruction of the other. These findings have crucial ramifications for international policy and interventions at times of global armed conflicts that are covered widely across social media channels.",

          "authors": "Caitlin M Miles",
          "abstract": "Based on 9 months of ethnographic fieldwork in Istanbul, Turkey, this article explores the affective attachments circulating around urban spaces of journalism in Istanbul, with particular attention to how experiences of urban life shape journalists’ imaginaries of their relationship to each other, the city, their audience, and the broader “public” of Turkey. This article considers how journalistic life and practice is a form of subjectivity that hinges upon spatialized affects and affective spaces. These affects emerge as the physical landscapes and spaces of journalism alter, whereby journalists attach and reflect on different spaces as they try to make sense of their professional lives amidst the uncertainties of spatial change. This article orients the narratives presented—which highlight themes of professional solidarity, dispossession, and social isolation—to argue that definitions and practices of journalism are “embedded in the changing rhythms and dynamics of urban life” (Rodgers et al., 2014: p. 106).",

          "abstract": "Changing levels of public trust in the news are of deep concern to both researchers and practitioners. We use data from 2015 to 2023 in 46 countries to explore how trust in news has changed, while also exploring the links with sociodemographic variables, differences by media system, and changing patterns of news use. We find that (a) there has been a small overall decline in trust in news since 2015, but also that (b) there are different trends in different countries. More specifically, trust has declined more in media environments that have become less structured by television news use, and increasingly structured by social media news use. Our findings underscore how changing structures of media use may be central to explaining trust dynamics in recent years, which suggests new avenues for restoring trust where it has eroded.",

          "authors": "Alexandra Main, Shun Ting Yung, Yaoyu Chen, Matthew J. Zawadzki",
          "abstract": "Emotion regulation has traditionally been conceptualized as an intrapersonal phenomenon with a focus on individuals’ personal experiences (e.g., feelings) and behaviors. However, a relational perspective on emotions underscores that emotion regulation occurs predominantly in the context of social interactions. Close relationships play an important role in emotion regulation in social interactions, particularly during emerging adulthood when individuals spend more time outside the family home. However, few studies have examined predictors of the use of different emotion regulation strategies in everyday life. Using Ecological Momentary Assessment, we first examined concurrent associations between social contexts (closeness to interaction partner and pleasantness of interaction) and use of emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression). Second, we used lagged models to explore potential bidirectional associations between aspects of the social context and emotion regulation strategy use. We collected EMA data four times per day for two weeks, resulting in 3,158 momentary assessments. Better quality of social interactions was associated with both less suppression and less reappraisal at the same moment, but not at subsequent moments. Interestingly, we found that reappraisal at one moment predicted more pleasant interactions and closeness at the next moment. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding both social contexts and emotion regulation on momentary levels. This study holds implications for understanding social context and emotion regulation in the everyday lives of emerging adults.",

          "abstract": "Based on open-ended survey data of 400 women who self-identify as either Black or Latinx, this study examines women’s digital media sharing practices in romantic relationships amid a growing trend towards the personalization of digital technologies. Communication Privacy Management (CPM) theory as well as scholarship on privacy and trust in romantic relationships frame our work. Approximately 56% of participants said romantic partners should not have access to each other’s social media accounts, 24% said they should, and 20%, said that access needed to be negotiated based on situational and personal factors (e.g., seriousness of the relationship, special circumstances). Justifications for sharing included having nothing to hide, trust, and a desire for open communication in the relationship. Explanatory themes for keeping social media and smartphone access private focused on trust, privacy, risk of conflict, and the need to respect a person’s individuality and personal boundaries. Interestingly, trust was a major motivator for both granting and denying access. We make sense of this duality of trust through the introduction of a trust/privacy dialectic relationship that extends current scholarship on CPM in romantic relationships.",

          "abstract": "Romantic attachment orientations are important predictors of individuals’ and their partners’ well-being and health. However, less is known about whether similarity in attachment between partners predicts better well-being and health outcomes. In two studies (total N couples = 1,602), we tested with actor-partner interdependence and dyadic polynomial regression models if partners’ attachment and their similarity were linked to their well-being and health (i.e., life satisfaction, depressive symptoms, self-rated health, medical conditions). Results revealed significant actor effects between anxiety and life satisfaction (Study 1, male partners Study 2), depressive symptoms (both studies), self-rated health (both studies), and medical conditions (Study 2 only). For avoidance, significant actor effects were found for life satisfaction (Study 1, female partners Study 2), depressive symptoms (both studies), and self-rated health (both studies). Partner effects emerged for anxiety and life satisfaction (Study 1, male partners Study 2) and depressive symptoms (Study 1 only) and for avoidance and life satisfaction (Study 1, male partners Study 2), depressive symptoms (both studies), and self-rated health (both studies). The results of dyadic polynomial regression and response surface analyses, however, provided no evidence for any similarity effects of romantic attachment on well-being and health in both studies. In sum, the findings suggest that lower anxiety and avoidance in both partners is generally associated with higher well-being and health. However, similarity in partners’ attachment seem unimportant for concurrent well-being and health. Implications of the findings are discussed considering attachment theories and relationship processes.",

          "authors": "Alexander C. Jensen, Sarah Ashby, Naomi M. Noorda, Jennie Jasperson",
          "abstract": "Approximately 80% of individuals from the United States have at least one sibling. Of those with siblings, a little more than half have two or more siblings. Yet, research on siblings across the life course, including young adulthood, has focused primarily on sibling dyads rather than larger sibling groups or multiple sibling dyads from the same family. The overarching aim of the current study was to explore the form and impacts of entire sibling groups and multiple sibling dyads for young adults with two or more siblings. Data were collected from an online survey of 975 young adults aged 19–29 years from across the United States ( M age = 25.43, SD = 2.52; 48% male; 73% white). Results showed that participants reported greater variation in sibling relationship quality when their siblings were not all the same gender and when their siblings had greater differences in age. Young adults were more likely to report a close aged sibling as the sibling with whom they have the closest relationship or most conflict. Relationship quality also showed links with psychosocial outcomes. In some cases, greater variation in sibling conflict and closer relationships with one particular sibling were linked to better outcomes. More conflict was linked to poorer outcomes. Multiple effects were moderated by gender, gender of the sibling, and characteristics of the entire sibling subsystem. Overall, our findings suggest that sibling relationships in medium to larger families are multifaceted and complex. Our results are in line with a family systems perspective that siblings have unique roles but that sibling dyads within families mutually influence and interact with one another.",

          "authors": "Mincheol Shin, Heejae Lee",
          "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;360-degree videos visualized through virtual reality (VR) technologies are recognized as an effective tool for fostering positive attitudes towards environmental stewardship by immersing users in persuasive storytelling narratives. However, a lack of an overarching framework hinders the understanding of its role in promoting prosocial environmental behaviors, particularly its effects on information processing and behavioral intentions. Notably, recent studies have suggested that feeling transported into a VR environment (i.e., presence) could positively bias message evaluation and the way people process information by activating heuristics connected to immersive experiences (i.e., the bias hypothesis of the heuristic-systematic model). Drawing on this proposition, this study conducted a between-subject design experiment (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 60), comparing a 360-degree pro-environmental campaign video in VR with that in a two-dimensional format. Results from PLS-SEM indicated that a 360-degree video in VR induced a higher sense of presence, yet heuristic evaluation of message credibility decreased when a sense of presence was low. Moreover, message credibility was found to be positively associated with the valence of message-relevant thoughts, but moderate evaluation of message credibility buffered the generation of valence of message-relevant thoughts. Finally, the valence of message-relevant thoughts had a curvilinear relationship with the intention to engage in pro-environmental behaviors, albeit with a small effect size. Results suggest the complexity in influencing behavioral intentions via 360-degree videos in VR. Nonetheless, the findings support the proposition that immersive affordance in immersive storytelling content could prompt users to align with campaign messages through activating a positive heuristic bias.&lt;/p&gt;",

          "abstract": "&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Virtual reality (VR) can evoke powerful emotions and transport people to diverse environments, making it a compelling tool for storytelling and learning. However, those who are anxious about technology may need to spend more cognitive resources and could have negative experiences because of the complexity of the medium, altering how they experience the narrative. Training may help people better-navigate virtual experiences by providing guidance. This study evaluates how individuals’ training type (paper, video, and VR) and computer anxiety influenced outcomes. We measured performance and self-reported outcomes while participants (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; = 284) navigated scenes, interacted with objects, and watched a narrative 360° video. Results showed that compared to participants who received training in paper, participants who received training in video or VR mastered more VR functions. Compared to participants who received training in video, those who trained directly in VR had less of a negative VR experience. Furthermore, participants who trained in VR perceived the training as more useful and found the VR tasks to be easier compared to those who received training in paper or video. Additionally, those with high levels of computer anxiety, regardless of training, had more negative outcomes than those with low computer anxiety, including less mastery of VR functions and engagement with the 360° video content, more of a negative VR experience, perceived the training as being less useful, and completed tasks with more difficulty. We discuss implications for theories of information processing in VR, as well as implications for scaled engagement with narratives and learning in VR. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

          "abstract": "In industrialized societies characterized by ubiquitous connectivity, many individuals disconnect from their phones or social media to break patterns of habitual use, reduce information overload, alleviate stress, and avoid distractions. Although research has predominantly focused on (young) adults, information on digital disconnection among adolescents remains limited. In response, in the present study, we analyzed survey data from 956 Flemish adolescents in Belgium (&lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;= 15.10, &lt;em&gt;SD &lt;/em&gt;= 1.61, and 64.8% girls) and, using latent class analysis, identified two subgroups: Class 1 labeled as “low adoption of social media apps and disconnection tools,” and Class 2 labeled as “high adoption of social media apps and disconnection tools.” Adolescents in Class 2 were more likely to use social media, specifically social networking, instant messaging, and entertainment apps, and to adopt disconnection tools (e.g., iOS Screentime or the Forest app). Next, drawing on the media practice model, we investigated how sociodemographic and sociopsychological factors contribute to those usage patterns and found that girls, older adolescents, and adolescents with higher scores for depressive symptoms and flourishing were more likely to belong to Class 2. Those findings offer new insights into adolescents’ social media connection and disconnection that can inform interventions to promote healthier smartphone use among adolescents.",

          "authors": "Francisco-Julián Martínez-Cano",
          "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly employed to create immersive, interactive audiovisual narratives that accentuate emotion, storytelling, and user engagement. By harnessing the potential of VR, these avant-garde narratives aim to instill values of equity, justice, and fairness. This article critically examines the largely unsubstantiated assertion that VR is the ultimate tool for fostering empathy by means of a qualitative evaluation of the influence of prosocial VR audiovisual narratives. The study involved the production of the first episode of &lt;em&gt;The Stigma Machine&lt;/em&gt;, a VR short film series in both traditional 2D and immersive VR formats, in a two-pronged production approach designed to examine the effects of the film on a sample of 44 university students from Spain (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 22) and Canada (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 22). The participants were segregated into two groups: Group 1 (1st VR Condition) viewed the VR experience first, followed by the traditional version, while Group 2 (1st Video Condition) viewed the two formats in reverse order. Data was collected before, during, and after viewing, using standardized questionnaires (interpersonal reactivity index, basic empathy scale, and Igroup presence questionnaire) and electroencephalogram devices to monitor brain activity. The dependent variables included: empathy, assessed using the interpersonal reactivity index and basic empathy scale surveys; electroencephalogram brain activity measures, indicating engagement, excitement, focus, interest, relaxation, and stress; presence, evaluated using the Igroup presence questionnaire; and various outcome variables.

The findings point to a need to focus more on narrative design and audiovisual content creation strategies than on VR technology itself.",

          "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;The aim in this paper is to expose the interstice between transformable and interactive architecture design and digital technology by experimenting with Extended Reality (XR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Inmotics (In), and having as a center the user experience (UX). This research was conducted during summer 2023, in the Architectural Studio: XR Assisted, Transformable and Interactive Design, at UWM, School of Architecture and Urban Planning. A UX+XR+AI+In method was created in four phases. Each phase incorporated a cross strategy UX+XR during the design process stages. Aspects of inclusion and accessibility, digital and physical, were considered as design guidelines. Using XR, the participants designed an architectural installation where the concept of transformability, ephemeral, interactivity, flexibility, adaptability, versatility, and playfulness was present. AI and XR, as part of architectural systems, implies a complex responsive urban installation for users with specific characteristics. Seven hybrid architectural installations were proposed. The AI and/or Inmotics interface echoed the operativity, interactivity and transformability of the designed hybrid architecture. Based on the collected data and testing, it was found that XR enhances the designer's perception, constitutes a new means of expression in real scale, and it is a highly immersive and interactive resource for the communication of multidimensional ideas, having as pillars: visualization, immersion, simulation, stimulation, and interaction. With this research it was proved that XR is not only a cosmetic accessory to project synthetic environments, but a powerful tool that allows spatiality to be understood differently and projected following the reality and needs of the user.&lt;/p&gt;",

          "authors": "Felix-Christopher Von Nostitz, Marie Neihouser, Giulia Sandri, Tristan Haute",
          "abstract": "There is a growing body of literature on the use and selection of social media platforms for political activism. However, less attention has been given to identifying citizens who are politically disconnected—those registered on social media platforms but not engaging in political activities. Additionally, whether patterns of non-use of social media for politics vary across different platforms remains understudied. Based on an online survey of 1,978 respondents conducted after the 2022 French presidential election campaign, this article aims to address these questions by examining the patterns and factors contributing to political disconnection from social media, particularly across six platforms: Facebook, private social networks, Instagram, Snapchat, X (formerly Twitter), and TikTok. Our findings indicate that three main factors explain political disconnection: digital skills, interest in politics (except for platforms less frequently used for politics), and social media efficacy. These results provide significant and original contributions to the broader debate on how and why individuals disconnect socially and technologically on social media platforms. While many studies focus on the variables that account for political participation in the age of social media, ours examines the conditions that explain non-use in the context of political disconnection. We also contribute to the existing literature by analysing the phenomenon of non-use holistically, addressing platform type, demographics, digital literacy, and political traits (e.g., interest and competence).",

          "abstract": "This article explores the complex, multi-layered mechanisms of internet censorship in China, emphasizing its role as both a tool of control over public engagement and a mechanism for elites to disconnect themselves from spaces of public scrutiny, and avoid potential threats such as doxxing by bottom-up populist online movements. Through in-depth interviews with social media users, this study investigates how individuals perceive, assess, and navigate the boundaries of internet censorship, focusing on their awareness of censorship practices, the assessment of sensitive content, and the tactics they employ to circumvent restrictions. We further examine how a sophisticated censorship mechanism—comprising self-censorship, platform censorship, and physical enforcement—works to disconnect netizens from grassroots collective actions. The findings reveal that internet censorship in China not only regulates online populist activism but also serves as a protective shield for elites, allowing them to curate a controlled digital space that suppresses critical discourse. By highlighting the ways in which both ordinary users and elites navigate the challenges of digital engagement in this heavily regulated environment, this study provides theoretical insights into the practice of disconnectivity as an elite privilege. It enhances our understanding of the interplay between connectivity, censorship, and disconnectivity in shaping the digital landscape and its implications for social change and political engagement in China and beyond.",

This concept, dubbed technoference, underlies the current study on how technological intrusions influence the parent–child relationship. This study of U.S. co-parents in families of preschool- and kindergarten-aged children examines the extent to which such interruptions are perceived to have negative consequences on the relationships that co-parents have with their children. The study found that the more the participant perceived the other co-parent as allowing technology to interfere during parent–child time together, the more likely the participant was to rate their co-parent's parent–child relationship quality negatively. Additional studies are needed to understand the young child's view of their parents' media use and how it impacts on their relationships.",

To address the research gap, we investigated the temporal and bidirectional relationships between parental phubbing, loneliness, and adolescent materialism. To be thorough, the mediating role of loneliness and the moderating role of gender were examined. Data were collected from 1,447 Chinese adolescents in June 2019 (T1) and January 2020 (T2). The results showed that T1 parental phubbing positively predicted T2 adolescent materialism, and T1 adolescent loneliness positively predicted T2 materialism, whereas neither of the reverse associations held. There were bidirectional relationships between parental phubbing and adolescent loneliness. Loneliness mediated the association between parental phubbing and subsequent adolescent materialism. There were no gender differences in these relationships. These findings enrich the literature by providing the first empirical support for how parental phubbing increases adolescent materialism.",

Their influence is rooted in their strategic hybridity, namely their ability to use the resources of fields outside politics to promote their partisan messages. This strategic hybridity is especially powerful in relation to the academy, as arguments can be framed with the trappings of scholarship without first passing muster in the scholarly community. This article documents how strategic hybridity has deepened online as the organization PragerU embraces a new tactic—the influencer-intellectual—and a new genre—social media ads—to advance its right-wing cause. To illustrate this new complexity, I analyze ads PragerU ran on Meta platforms that attacked the 1619 Project and had at least 20 million impressions. Beyond reconceptualizing hybridity, I review the shortcomings of Meta’s Ad Library while making the case for its value in tracking the spilling of partisanship from formal politics into culture.",

We examine the “child idol” phenomenon as a case study wherein children perform as a younger version of K-pop idols under entertainment agencies’ in-house training systems, with calibrated construction of social media personae by influencer agencies and their parents. Despite ongoing attempts to protect children in the industry, undertaken by the Korean government and human rights organizations, the exploitative environment of child stars becomes even more serious as it becomes a template adopted by other countries emulating the success of K-pop.",

Our study shows that social media played a contradictory role in how Asian Americans experience and cope with the surge in anti-Asian sentiment. Findings from our thematic analysis demonstrate that (1) the negative experiences of social media in conjunction with racial identity that influences Asian Americans’ psychological well-being, (2) the positive role of social media offering a space for collective solidarity, and (3) the positive role of social media activism as a means of collective coping and resilience.",

          "abstract": "Negative attributions about the cause of and blame for relationship problems are highly predictive of relationship dysfunction and depression. Consequently, researchers have attempted to understand the role of negative relationship attributions in the association between depression and relationship functioning, with theory and research suggesting negative attributions may mediate the association between depression and relationship functioning. However, these studies were conducted on individuals, not couples. Including a couple of data and employing a dyadic design can provide a more holistic picture of the associations among these variables. The present study used the actor‐partner interdependence mediation model (APIMeM) to examine associations among depressive symptoms, relationship functioning, and negative partner attributions. Different‐gender couples ( N = 200) seeking couples’ clinical services completed measures of negative relationship attributions, relationship distress, and depressive symptoms. Results revealed depressive symptoms to be indirectly related to one's own and one's partner's relationship functioning through one's own negative causal attributions. Actor and partner effects of responsibility attributions and depressive symptoms on relationship functioning were also observed. Results underscore the possible mechanistic role of negative attributions—particularly causal attributions—in maintaining the depression‐relationship dysfunction association.",

However, it is not clear if activity on Twitter can be used to forecast elections, given conflicting findings in the literature. By analyzing 830,796 tweets mentioning key hashtags related to nine US senate races in 2014, 2016, and 2018, we demonstrate that cascades in volume and sentiment of tweets between September 1 and Election Day can predict election outcomes. We developed a non-linear growth modeling tool to identify the point in time at which bandwagon support for competing candidates begins to diverge. We also discovered that bot-driven tweets play a negligible role. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for both computational research and media effects, showing the value of combining big-data analysis and longitudinal non-linear dynamics to study the relationship between social media activity and real-world outcomes.",

Results show that hostility toward leaders increases as voting approaches and as candidates’ public visibility grows, and that it affects frontrunner leaders the most. Furthermore, the analysis of the different forms of incivility showed that it changes depending on the target it hits, revealing unexpected aspects: contrary to expectations, incivility against the only female leader (Giorgia Meloni) are not “sexist attacks” but forms of demonization (i.e., association with figures/symbols concerning totalitarian regimes); while against Giuseppe Conte, accusations of “illegality,” lies and “misinformation” prevail, that is, the same kind of incivility that he and his party use against opponents. Finally, we found that the authors of uncivil attacks are mainly ordinary/sporadic users, with all the consequences that this implies in terms of a normalization of incivility in public debate.",

The images provoke a dialogue about how photography can be used, not only as an ethnographic passport, but also in a broader sense of encountering spaces, processes and organizations, thus assisting in unpacking various layers of society and how it (dis)connects with nature. Developing a ‘go-along’ ethnographic approach, such as taking ‘toxic tours’ with research subjects, the techniques of portraiture, landscape and documentary photography were used to produce a sequence of vignettes (as opposed to photographic series) that reveal interlocking modalities of contestation and questions of environmental (in)justices. The combination of images and text uniquely afforded by the format of the photo-essay engenders an understanding not only of the unique individual stories of the people embroiled in this coastal problem, but their connection to wider social structures amidst a seemingly ‘local’ siting struggle.",
