          "authors": "Jessy Escande",
          "abstract": "This study investigates how the Irish Dullahan—a headless fairy death messenger—came to be recast as an undead monster in Japanese popular culture. Contrary to the trend of Western tabletop role-playing games playing a central role in similar Japanese reinventions, our analysis reveals that the undead Dullahan was an exception. Instead, we demonstrate how it was shaped by the convergence of foreign influences during the 1980s and 1990s, with a central role played by the Japanese Celtic boom in that period. By examining early video games, fantasy dictionaries, and other paratexts, we highlight how cultural brokers (e.g., game artists and editors) actively reshaped imported folklore. Our findings contribute to broader discussions on cultural hybridization and underscore how games and related media powerfully influence the global perception of folkloric motifs across the broader mediascape.",

          "authors": "Yang Li, Seung Ho Park",
          "abstract": "Purpose Prior research on peer-to-peer (P2P) lending and electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) has overlooked how eWOM valence ambiguity and the external environment influence the relationship between eWOM volume and platform performance. Based on signaling and information processing theories, this study differentiates various types of eWOM valence ambiguities and examines how these ambiguities, along with the external environment, affect the impact of eWOM volume on P2P lending platform performance. Design/methodology/approach Using data from Chinese P2P lending platforms (January 2018–July 2019), econometric analyses evaluate the connection between eWOM volume and platform performance as well as the moderating effects of valence ambiguity and external uncertainty. Findings The findings confirm that eWOM volume significantly influences platform performance. However, this positive effect diminishes with high inconsistencies between star ratings and textual eWOM or increased external uncertainty. Research limitations/implications This study’s scope is limited to Chinese P2P lending. Future research should explore diverse markets and user engagement through experimental designs. Practical implications This study offers practical strategies for P2P lending platforms in emerging markets, emphasizing the importance of managing inconsistencies between star ratings and textual reviews and addressing lenders’ concerns in uncertain signaling environments. Originality/value This study advances the understanding of P2P lending and eWOM dynamics by analyzing the interplay between eWOM volume and internal and external factors related to eWOM diagnosability. It highlights how inconsistencies in star ratings and textual eWOM, coupled with external uncertainty, exacerbate decision-making challenges for potential lenders and reduce the positive impact of eWOM volume.",

          "authors": "Quinten S. Bernhold, Anna McClure, Jalen Blue, Sarah Devereux, Cole Burns",
          "abstract": "Grounded in the communicative ecology model of successful aging, this study examined how memorable messages about death, dying, and the afterlife (DDA) are associated with aging experiences. In a self-report survey, older adults ( N = 300, M age = 59.74 years) wrote a memorable message about DDA and reported on the message's motivational impact. They also reported on their affect about aging, aging efficacy, and successful aging. The memorable messages were coded into themes, and path modeling revealed that the themes of people (a) engaging in some activity after they die, (b) cherishing life, (c) leaving a legacy, and (d) experiencing eternal damnation were associated with memorable message motivational impact (MMMI). MMMI was indirectly associated with successful aging, via the serial mediators of positive affect about aging and aging efficacy. Positive affect about aging may be a crucial mediating mechanism that helps translate experiences with memorable messages into successful aging.",

          "abstract": "We investigate the impact of political correctness (PC) on perception and behavioral intentions, evaluating its effectiveness in being inoffensive, inclusive, and nonstigmatizing. Despite its widespread institutional adoption, its real-world effects remain understudied. We explored three questions: Does PC succeed in its aims? How does it influence perceptions? How does it affect behavioral intentions? We conducted six survey-based experiments with 2,179 participants balanced across political affiliation, age, sex, and education. Tasks assessed reactions to PC, its effects on mood and perceptions, and how it shaped judgments and behavioral intentions in varied contexts. Results indicate PC often fails its objectives. Participants, especially Conservatives and older individuals, found it exclusive, stigmatizing, and offensive. It reduced positive mood, undermined a doctor's credibility, and decreased care-seeking intent. PC also lessened concern for serious issues and shifted behavioral motivations. Despite its inclusive intent, PC can trigger negative responses, warranting scrutiny of its pervasive use.",

          "authors": "Lillian Darke, Helen Paterson, Celine van Golde",
          "abstract": "Gaslighting is a covert form of psychological manipulation that undermines an individual’s confidence in their perceptions, thoughts, and memories, often by labelling them as irrational or ‘crazy.’ Public awareness of gaslighting has surged in recent years, making it a common topic in media and popular culture. However, empirical research has lagged behind, leaving gaps in understanding how the public perceives and defines this form of abuse. Addressing public understanding of covert abuse is critical for improving early recognition by victims, bystanders, and front-line services, as well as encouraging support-seeking behaviours. This study examined public perceptions of gaslighting by presenting 595 university students with vignettes manipulating key contested components: repetition, intention, and victim outcomes. Participants assessed the vignettes on seriousness, acceptability, likelihood of intervention, and whether they classified the behaviour as gaslighting. They also provided definitions of gaslighting and completed a gaslighting acceptance scale. Findings indicate that while students generally recognise gaslighting as emotional abuse, ambiguities remain in its definition and identification. These results underscore the need for educational campaigns to clarify gaslighting’s patterns and severity. Targeted initiatives, particularly in schools and community settings, could foster cultural change, enhance bystander intervention, and reduce the prevalence of covert abusive behaviours.",

Our findings suggest that partisan media use may undermine willingness to support politicians who engage in deliberative compromises with opponents. This effect is likely driven by the tendency of partisan media to diminish willingness to engage in political listening and instigate moral considerations of the party’s policy goals.",

In this article, I examine NASA’s narrative, which is gathering consensus as the origin story of digital twin technologies, with two main points of focus. First, through an examination of the dynamics of control and error, I scrutinise the ways in which the NASA ethos and worldview may be embedded within contemporary uses of digital twin technologies. Second, through an analysis of two subsequent NASA missions and the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey , I frame digital twin technologies as ‘space media’ which, Gál et al. claim, can ‘reorient our view [. . .] to “off-Earth” perspectives’. This approach reveals the potential of digital twins to propagate imaginaries beyond the managerial systems of control that constitute their dominant contemporary usages.",

          "abstract": "Algorithmic media proliferates. Alongside such proliferation, the familiar doubles of pre-digital daily life – the specters, phantoms, and apparitions found in folklore, novels, film, and music – are maturing into new kinds of fluid and apparently agentic Others. Such Others – data-driven doppelgangers, literally “double-goers” – increasingly co-constitute their primaries across space and time, entangling erstwhile human users into a more-than-human assemblage. Yet such an assemblage is contentious: the promise of double-goers is mired in surveillance capitalism. Despite being so mired, double-goers emerge as aspirational co-inheritors of yesterday’s tomorrows. As such, they are part of the affective conditions into which we – artists formerly known as human – are now thrown. We are tasked with learning to live with our double-goers. By reassembling the doppelganger in relation to algorithmic media, we provide foundations for a playful choreography: a dance with the new double-goer that moves beyond critical and affective revulsion.",

          "abstract": "This editorial investigates the epistemic and media-theoretical significance of digital twinning as a decision-making practice. Digital twins purport to calculate futures based on sensor data in conjunction with generative AI, cloud computing, and Internet-of-things architectures; they shape institutional decisions and are used to make such decisions accountable. To illustrate this, examples from the logistics, transportation, and military sectors are contrasted to earlier simulations and described as “phenomenotechniques.” We argue that digital twins are recent expressions of a technocratic paradigm characterized by the imperative to make everything worldly “count,” datafying and modeling it within digital environments in real time for future predictions. Digital twins are thus performative agents in a network of feedback loops between humans, machines, environments, and algorithms. This article concludes with an overview of the special issue, placing digital twins in the phenomenological context of media that are seamlessly and simultaneously logistical, spatial, and transformative.",

          "abstract": "Within the context of three-dimensional simulations of urban space and their variables within, digital twin technologies (DTs) are touted as making urban governance and planning effective, calculable, evidence-based while reducing costs and complexity. We conducted 3 years of in-depth fieldwork on the application of DTs for urban governance in the Netherlands. Our empirical and critical analysis shows that DTs are not characterized by a novel quality of technological promise, but rather conform to prevalent narratives wherein technologies are marketed and advertised through specific imaginaries. Deconstructing the sociotechnical imaginaries through empirical evidence of real uses cases highlights the gap between the promise of the digital twin narratives and the emerging responses and practices in government. Therefore, through deconstruction, we call for practical, realistic, and responsible uses of DTs for urban governance and provide preliminary regulatory steps.",

          "abstract": "Chinese street vendors use Douyin streaming to navigate precarious livelihoods in a platform economy. While existing research examines digital labor and emerging business models, it overlooks how informal workers manage the dual roles of running offline businesses and livestreaming. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews, the research develops a “temporal opportunity” framework, identifying three interconnected dimensions: temporal regimes, temporal performativity, and the temporal production of opportunities. This captures (1) how vendors’ labor practices are restructured and interwoven, generating new synchronization and temporal constraints; (2) how time becomes a critical resource and component of streaming performances, with vendors skillfully orchestrating rhythms, durations, and sequences to sustain audience engagement and increase earnings; and (3) how platforms mediate economic possibilities, shaping uncertainties tied to algorithmic dynamics. This study clarifies the complex interplay of time, labor, and digital platforms in informal economies, advancing the understanding of temporality and performativity in platform-mediated livelihoods.",

          "abstract": "This article considers digital twins and digital twinning practices in relation to the spaces of the factory, city, and the “metaverse.” We draw on the work of urban and new media theorists to argue that digital twins are part of a long history of urban media and computation. Expanding on Walter Benjamin’s notion of phantasmagoria, we argue that the logics of the factory inherent in early digital twins are intensified and expanded in the more recent translation to urban digital twins and spatial media architectures. We identify three frames that articulate the relation of digital twins to cities, the factory, and media-driven phantasmagoria: the topological structuring of the city as a future site of commodification; the production logic that expands from the factory into the urban digital twin; and the phantasmagoric construction of the spaces of the metaverse, which hides complex relations through interactive media spectacles.",

          "abstract": "The EU’s Digital Twin of the Ocean (DTO) is presented as a coherent, high-resolution, multi-dimensional, multi-variable and near real-time representation of the ocean that integrates new data sources with advanced modeling, artificial intelligence and high-performance computing. The two-way exchange of information between marine ecosystems and the digital twin is intended to create a feedback loop between the digital and physical realms that is emblematic of environing media. The EU’s vision is that the DTO will empower citizens, inform politicians, support a blue economy, and improve protection of the marine environment. The sociotechnical imaginary of the DTO presents a narrative that a balance between sustainable exploitation and conservation can be had through the use of sophisticated digital technology. But what is at stake in this technocratic control over the world ocean, and where does it come from? Whose interest will digital twins ultimately serve? Understood in its historical and environmental context, the DTO caters to the aims of sustainable development, but risks veiling continued unsustainable development and growth under the guise of new digital technologies. We use the theoretical lens of environing media and sociotechnical imaginaries to critically unpack this narrative and its historical contingencies, and show how difficult goal conflicts are systematically glossed over through a veil of datafication and technological development.",

To show why and to what extent the concept of spectrality is particularly well suited for discussing the post-digital mediality of twinning, this article proceeds in two steps. First, it reviews research on twin metaphors and the uncanny in cybernetics and digital media. This provides a contextualization of digital twinning within a media theoretical tradition. Second, the figure of the specter is revisited in an interpretation of Derrida’s Specters of Marx that focuses on the aspects of its corporeality, temporality, immateriality, and performativity. As a result, digital twinning is reconceptualized as a performative practice that enables the spectral materialization of many potential behaviors. As such, it destabilizes traditional notions of temporality, participates in the process of commodification and bears responsibility for a democracy to come.",

          "abstract": "Originating in the field of manufacturing, the Digital Twin (DT) concept is now being applied across a range of application domains, from personal healthcare to whole Earth observation. Despite enthusiasm for DTs, uncertainties have arisen concerning their lack of definition and technical specificity. This paper reassesses the concept with particular consideration for its application to cities in the form of Urban Digital Twins (UDTs). Rather than identifying DTs with a particular set of technologies, we instead understand them as embodying a core ‘conceptual model’ describing a mechanism for control based on the generation and feedback of information, elsewhere characterised as a ‘steering representation’. By aligning their use with more participatory forms of governance involving the ‘commoning’ of city information, we argue that UDTs might then provide powerful new means for participation in urban planning and governance through the support they provide for communication, collective sensemaking and shared oversight.",

Thus, the article argues that wind and other fluids are moved as software and data in the logistical circuit that underpins design and digital twinning. However, this take on logistics of wind emerges at the back of a longer history of visual cultures of wind—including such takes as Harun Farocki’s Parallel video essay on computer graphics and software modeling of elemental media—while focusing more on the past decades of software plug-ins as well as game engines.

This article traces the rise of resilience as a dominant epistemology and practice in environmental management, logistics, demography, and energy. I will argue that resilience has become the dominant discourse by which time and uncertainty are currently being managed in the wake of post-World War II decolonization, generating new techniques such as digital twinning and generative artificial intelligence (AI). Moreover, resilience has become a new logic making the planet, and its living populations, computationally measurable and representable, and amenable to new forms of technical manipulation and action.",

It situates the digital twin as a distinctive contemporary form of simulation and examines how it is making up people, things, scenes and their interactions in novel ways: the drawing in of unstructured datastreams and their experimental recombining and modification. Although the digital twin is often represented as a digital copy or replica of the physical world, it actually departs radically from a mimetic copy; advancing a mode of twinning that classifies, extracts and divides. The essay addresses digital twinning as an emerging form of knowledge and action in the world. It proposes three distinctive logics of the contemporary politics of digital twins: intervention, prediction and action. Each of these aspects is discussed through the situated digital twin domains of the factory, the clinic and the battlefield.",

It aims to revise Gabrys’ original concept of planetary media by revealing the collapse of the globe (as capitalist and human-centered) and planet (as geological and ecological) in digital twins applied to both Earth System Science and socioeconomic domains. Their collapse is also evident in scientific papers related to EU’s Destination Earth and China’s Digital Earth, policy reports on EU’s green/digital transition and China’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), and documents on the smart cities in both regions. All of these share optimization and resilience as not only digital twins’ technical requirements but also key values for establishing them as sociotechnical imaginaries of transforming the Earth’s human activities and natural environments in the service of its sustainable future.",

Adopting a constructivist perspective toward UDTs, this article contributes to the emerging literature on “twinning”: the making of UDTs, which produces an interrelation between tangible reality and its digital representation in order to enable new forms of knowledge and urban governance. Through a comparative analysis of UDT projects in Boston, Namur, and Munich, we explore how digital representations of cities are co-produced with ideas about desirable governance. Our locally situated perspective highlights the interrelations of twinning in three dimensions: representation, epistemic promise, and ideas of desirable urban governance. The analysis provides crucial insights into the role of digital technologies in shaping urban futures, offering a critical reading of the current trend of UDTs in urban governance, and is attentive to its social and political implications.",

We argue that digital twins propose and pursue a logistical mode of prediction that seeks to operationalize simulated futures and in doing so subordinate human labor, decision-making, and governance to computational systems tied to material environments. Even when digital twins fail to work or maintain frictions in underlying systems, their value is tightly bound to the question of who can own, control, coordinate, and capitalize on the logistical architectures of data and computation that anticipate as-yet unrealized returns from future probabilities. Following a genealogical examination of twinning techniques, the article examines Alibaba’s City Brain platform in Xiong’an, China, and the predictive capabilities of Palantir’s Foundry platform to show how digital twins seek the preemptive capture of futures in the present.",

Tuvalu’s Future Now Project aims to create a ‘digital nation’ in the metaverse. This article critically analyses this state-scale digital twinning from two theoretical lenses. First, drawing on deep ecology, it argues the virtual reproduction substitutes the intrinsic value of Tuvalu’s landscape and culture with instrumental value optimised for digital capitalism’s extractive logic. Second, building on concepts from Benjamin and Baudrillard, it contends that digital twinning subverts the cultural symbolic order through semiotic transformation, rendering the ‘digital nation’ a hyperreal imitation stripped of aura. Rather than preserving sovereignty over disappeared territory, the metaverse reproduction reimagines the state itself as a simulation. While responding to the severe threat of global warming, the project raises critical questions about the politics and value of virtual reproduction.",

However, evolution is one of the most misunderstood concepts among the general public. Informal learning environments like natural history museums offer great potential for learning about evolution by showing the latest scientific findings in their exhibitions. But to date, there is a lack of evidence about museum visitors’ understanding of evolution. Therefore, this study aims to identify which evolutionary key concepts and misconceptions are applied by visitors when asked to explain evolutionary scenarios. Using an online survey, visitors ( n = 122) were asked to answer two open-response ACORNS items. Overall, respondents tended to use relatively few key concepts in their responses. Although museum visitors are considered a highly educated group, our surveyed visitors seem to have a poor understanding of evolution. The key concepts and misconceptions identified might help develop future exhibitions and educational programs/activities.",
