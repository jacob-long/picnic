          "abstract": "We develop an integrative conceptual framework and research agenda for studying epistemic authorities in the digital age. Consulting epistemic authorities (e.g., professional experts, well-informed laypeople, technologies) can be an efficient fast-track to knowledge. To fulfill this functional role, those who claim epistemic authority need to be both subjectively recognized (have a perceived advantage in knowledge) and objectively justified (have an actual advantage in knowledge). In a digital media context, new and unconventional knowledge sources have emerged that can fulfill the functional role of epistemic authorities. But false authorities that disseminate misinformation have emerged as well while other sources with important knowledge remain unrecognized. We further analyze the functional role of epistemic intermediaries that can mitigate such problematic developments by correcting false authorities and by providing endorsement for unrecognized authorities. We conclude with a research agenda to study functional forms of epistemic authorities and epistemic intermediaries in the digital public sphere.",

          "abstract": "Communication researchers have long sought to situate or contextualize media behaviors in their natural settings. However, the many approaches taken to understand media behavior in context have varied considerably. This article proposes a metatheoretical framework for theorizing media behavior at the situational level, encompassing the entirety of circumstances surrounding a media behavior at a given moment. The framework describes how psychological states, environmental context, and media context combine to shape moment-to-moment media behavior. We then describe how situational factors have the potential to interact with the three phases of media behavior—i.e., selection, processing, and disengagement—in distinctive ways. We argue that communication researchers only gain the ability to explain the variability in media behavior by taking the situational level into account. We conclude by providing future theoretical and empirical directions to guide the field in building a more generalizable and durable understanding of situated media behavior.",

          "authors": "David Matencio Durán, Thomas Apperley",
          "abstract": "This article advocates for a reevaluation of the thief class as a bridge linking literary narratives and tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs). It traces the roots of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D) thief class in Picaresque Literature against the wider importance of literature in the early TRGP scene, by comparing the thief class to the Picaresque rogue. Through a thematic analysis of articles from eight key TRPG periodicals published between 1975 and 1986, the article illustrates how “extensibility mechanisms” facilitated creative exchanges between hobbyist game designers, Fantasy fiction, and Picaresque Literature via the rogue archetype. These exchanges demonstrate a turn towards nuanced narrative-supporting mechanics, complex player character development, and including vibrant fantasy cities as settings for adventures in D&amp;D, and TRPGs more broadly, influenced by Picaresque Literature.",

          "abstract": "Videogames, like other new media, reflect and shape culture and are influenced by societal attitude shifts. We conducted a qualitative close-reading analysis of queer representation in the AAA historical-fiction series Assassin's Creed and the historical antecedents thereof to explore (a) the traditional marginalization of queer-identifying folks in (b) the context of growing societal acceptance within the (inter)national zeitgeist. In our examination of the developer's reaction operationalized as observable shifts in developers’ design choices, we observed an increase in representation that aligns with the shift in social attitudes toward queer folks over the last 15 years. With respect to the historical antecedents, we discovered a misalignment between the in-game portrayal of queer folks and acceptance thereof vis a vis the available historical record.",

In the past decade, these discussions have extended beyond academia to the broader gaming community, where certain genres have been elevated as “real games.” Genres like walking simulators, dating sims, visual novels, and hybrid forms are often at the center of these debates. , criticized for their simplicity, lack of challenge, or sometimes overtly sexual content. Despite this, the popularity of these genres is undeniable: since 2007, over 50,000 titles have been documented on the Visual Novel Database, and thousands of walking simulators are available on Steam and other platforms. Many of these titles also appear on MobyGames and have been referenced as “games” throughout history. In this article, we delve into this vast and often overlooked corpus to examine the qualities that can elevate gameplay to unreal levels.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Companies increasingly leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance human performance, particularly in e-commerce. However, the effectiveness of AI augmentation remains controversial. This study investigates whether, how and why AI enhances human agents’ sales through a randomized field experiment. Design/methodology/approach This study conducts a two-by-two factorial randomized field experiment ( N  = 1,090) to investigate the effects of AI augmentation on sales. The experiment compares sales outcomes handled solely by human agents with those augmented by AI, while also examining the moderating effect of agents’ experience levels and the underlying mechanisms behind agents’ responses. Findings The results reveal that AI augmentation leads to a significant 5.46% increase in sales. Notably, the impact of AI augmentation varies based on agents’ experience levels, with inexperienced agents benefiting nearly six times more than their experienced counterparts. Mediation analysis shows that AI augmentation improves response timeliness, accuracy and sentiment, thereby boosting sales. Originality/value This study highlights the role of AI augmentation in human–AI collaboration, demonstrates the varying impacts of AI augmentation based on agents’ experience levels and offers insights for organizations on how to regulate AI augmentation to enhance agent responses and drive sales.",

          "abstract": "Political satire is often believed to enrich the public sphere in ways distinct from traditional journalism. This study examines whether deliberative qualities of online political talk in response to satire differ from those in response to regular news or partisan news. The analysis focuses on four normative standards: interactivity, diversity, rationality, and civility. A manual content analysis of YouTube comments (n = 2,447) reveals that the public sphere surrounding political satire shows a notable strength: Less incivility, both in terms of impoliteness and intolerance. Surprisingly, aside from this, satire’s public sphere did not differ much from that of regular news. Comments on partisan news were more opinionated and ideologically diverse. These findings suggest that online political talk prompted by satire is not inferior to that of traditional news. Additionally, this study highlights how the presence of different normative standards is often interconnected.",

          "abstract": "Collaborative work represents a communicative context in which organizational actors navigate the blurring of knowledge and authority boundaries as they address complex problems. This article theorizes about expertise tension that arises when individuals with valuable insights lack corresponding authority to act, or vice versa. Using observations and interviews, we studied how physicians and nurses navigated this tension in problem-solving situations in a hospital emergency department. We found that nurses, who identified emergent problems, simultaneously asserted their situational authority and displayed a veneer of deference by asking physicians, “What do you want to do [in this situation]?” The question prompted one of three problem-solving activities (i.e., instruction by demand, reversed instruction, and collaborative improvisation) depending on the situation’s urgency and ambiguity. We discuss how nurses and physicians managed expertise tension without undermining their different claims to expertise and authority, highlighting the value of a communication-centered view in examining such dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Language bias, both positive and negative, is a well-documented phenomenon exhibited among human interlocutors. We examine whether this bias is exhibited toward virtual assistants, specifically, Apple's Siri and Google Assistant, with various accents. We conducted three studies with different stimuli and designs to investigate U.S. English speakers’ attitudes toward Google's British, Indian, and American voices and Apple's Irish, Indian, South African, British, Australian, and American voices. Analysis reveals consistently lower fluency ratings for Irish, Indian, and South African voices (compared with American) but no consistent results of bias related to competence, warmth, or willingness to interact. Moreover, participants often misidentified voices’ countries of origin but correctly identified them as artificial. We conclude that this overall lack of bias may be due to two possibilities: lack of humanlikeness of the voices and lack of availability of nonstandardized voices and voices from countries toward which those in the United States typically show bias.",

          "abstract": "Managing relationship conflict is a difficult yet crucial task for romantic partners. We investigated how imagining a conflict’s resolution affects the engagement in resolving that conflict. For instance, people may indulge in positive fantasies about their future, or they may mentally contrast their desired future (successful conflict resolution) with the main inner obstacle (e.g., anger, frustration) in the current reality. In two experiments, we tested whether mental contrasting increases engagement in resolving ongoing relationship conflicts participants perceived as important (i.e., high incentive value) and solvable (i.e., high expectations of success). In Experiment 1 ( N = 274, from predominantly satisfied relationships), mental contrasting compared to indulging improved the resolution of solvable conflicts over two weeks. This effect did not extend to conflicts of highest importance, which we found to be particularly severe. In Experiment 2 ( N = 270, from less satisfied relationships), mental contrasting, compared to indulging and to working on a concentration task, increased mental engagement with highly important, more severe conflicts over two weeks. Results suggest that mental contrasting helps in resolving solvable conflicts. When facing more severe, less solvable conflicts, however, mental contrasting stimulated mental engagement with conflicts. Our findings suggest that teaching people mental contrasting may complement existing conflict management approaches (e.g., in counseling or in self-help apps).",

          "abstract": "Despite rising interest in understanding siblings as socialization agents of young adults’ well-being in diverse cultural contexts, strengths-based research on the sibling socialization of youth prosocial behaviors in non-Western, majority world settings (i.e., India) is lacking. The present study investigated the associations between siblings’ relationship qualities (i.e., support and conflict) and prosocial behaviors towards different recipients (i.e., family, friends, and strangers), and considered the intervening roles of family respect values and empathy among Asian Indian young adults. Cross-sectional data were drawn from 197 college students ( M = 21.6 years, SD = 2.3, range = 18–25; 61.6% women) with at least one sibling from urban liberal arts colleges in India. Using online surveys, participants self-reported on their perceived levels of support and conflict with siblings, empathy, family respect, and prosocial behaviors. Path analyses yielded evidence for both family respect and empathy as intervening mechanisms between sibling support (but not sibling conflict) and prosocial behaviors. Sibling support was related to higher family respect, which was subsequently associated with greater empathy. In turn, empathy was linked to more prosocial behaviors towards family, friends, and strangers. Sibling conflict was only directly associated with lower family respect. Findings have key implications for traditional and culturally-integrated theoretical models of prosocial development by emphasizing the interplay of sibling relationship qualities, cultural values, and moral developmental mechanisms for Asian Indian young adults’ prosocial behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Intuitively, personality traits may shape friendships differently from academic connections, potentially influencing social support development. Yet, this remains understudied, while it is crucial for student’s wellbeing. Therefore, this study investigates how the personality traits of the Five-Factor Model interact with the role friendships and preferred collaboration relationships. In a sample of 95 university students, socio-centric data were collected with questionnaires on personality traits and longitudinally on networks of friendship and preferences for collaboration networks. Utilizing stochastic actor-oriented models in RSiena, we showed that students more open to new experiences established more friendships, preferred more collaborations with their peers, and were also more popular in both networks than students less open-to-new-experiences. Students scoring higher on agreeableness were less likely to connect to their peers in both networks, whereas higher-achieving students were more likely to establish peer relationships in both networks. Furthermore, friends were preferred for collaboration (and vice versa), indicating an overlap. This study points to the importance of personality traits and achievement when students integrate into their social and academic environment.",

          "abstract": "Research has shown that individuals from sexual and gender minorities are more likely to be stigmatized. Taking the perceiver’s perspective, we conducted two experimental studies to examine gender nonconformity stigma and the conditions under which such stigma is more (or less) likely to emerge. In both studies, participants were asked to read descriptions of targets varying in gender (non)conformity and assigned sex (Study 1; N = 337) or sexual identity (Study 2; N = 406). Results from both studies showed that participants preferred more social distance from gender nonconforming (vs. conforming) targets, tended to dehumanize them (i.e., attributed them more primary and less secondary emotions), and reported less anti-violence behavioral intentions and justifications. In both studies, results further showed that having more frequent and positive personal contact with gender nonconforming individuals helps buffer against gender nonconformity bias. Unexpectedly, results from Study 2 showed that humanizing gender nonconforming targets (rather than dehumanizing them) was associated with more violence predispositions for participants who reported having more negative personal contact with gender nonconforming individuals. No differences were found according to the targets’ assigned sex or sexual identity. Taken together, our findings highlight the need to understand the causes and boundaries of gender nonconformity bias.",

          "abstract": "Drawing from a two-year ethnography with sixteen adults in Flanders and Brussels, Belgium, this study disentangles the social, material, and individual obstacles experienced in day-to-day life that hinder and foster digital well-being. Findings show how these obstacles are interrelated, laying bare the tensions that cut across social relations, digital devices, and spaces. Moreover, (gendered) responsibilities and social relations impact whether someone can, or even desires, to overcome obstacles to digital well-being. We thus observed a “constrained agency” that limited individual efforts in feeling digitally well. Emphasizing the relational characteristics of connected everyday life, the study argues that identifying where agency is constrained can make visible the layers and tensions in people’s experiences with digital media use. To put this into practice, we echo the call for a re-imagination of digitized everyday life that questions underlying inequalities and privileges, seeing a need for individual and collective strategies that can foster sustainable digital well-being.",

Collecting all created and engaged posts ( n = 31,084) from 102 lesbian gamers in both lesbian gamer and female gamer groups, this research utilizes structural topic modeling to delineate their productive and consumptive curation across different groups. The results indicate that lesbian gamers often prioritize discussions on women and queer issues within the female gamer community while presenting a more gamer-centric identity in the lesbian gamer community. Group-swinging emerges as an optimal strategy for exploring a balance between belongingness and distinctiveness, enabling lesbian gamers to navigate their multiple minority identities effectively. This study enriches the understanding of identity curation and optimal distinctiveness theory, offering plausible strategies for the online resilience of marginalized groups within the polymedia context.",

In France, a movement to denounce gynaecological and obstetrical violence is expressed through a massive publication of testimonies on social networks. Via a socio-representational approach and from a critical gender perspective, this article aims to explore how people use digital media to communicate about the GE, and to analyse the experiences related to the GE and the representation systems underlying them. Using an inductive strategy, a corpus of discussion from the Doctissimo forum, and testimonies and comments from the PayeTonGynéco Facebook pages and Tumblr was created and submitted to lexicographical analysis. Our results suggest that the GE is indicative of a broader social function. People seem to use digital media to cope with a form of social ignorance of women’s experience in gynaecology with a certain ambivalence regarding their liberating potential.",

          "abstract": "This study advances the theoretical understanding of the effects of incidental news exposure on political knowledge by probing the mechanisms through which exposure transfers to learning. Two studies in the U.S. across both non-election and election settings test the centrality of political discussion on social media with strong and weak ties in explaining this relationship. Findings across both studies show no significant direct associations between incidental news exposure and political knowledge. However, mediation analyses suggest that incidental news exposure can influence political knowledge when mediated by interpersonal political conversations on social media: discussions with strong ties contribute to political knowledge, but discussions with weak ties are detrimental. Furthermore, the indirect effects via strong and weak ties are significantly conditioned by one’s cognitive ability. The findings highlight the conditions under which incidental news exposure helps yet also hinders individuals’ political knowledge.",

An analysis of the content, form, and stance of 250 videos revealed that creators of PoV memes lip-sync to audio remediated from pop culture and mimic how they imagine “you” would act in a given scenario. I offer the concept of “echoic affiliation” to describe how PoV memes leverage TikTok’s “use this sound” function to construct ephemeral bonds between users. Furthermore, PoV memes textually articulate multiple perspectives, producing intersubjective encounters that reflect a platform imaginary in which “the algorithm” efficiently clusters similar people on the same “side” of the app. In the conclusions, I present a novel definition of PoV memes and reflect on the pivotal role of affiliation for TikTok’s platform vernacular.",

Results show that the scientist in Chinese films tends to be male, middle-aged, married, sociable, and with tidy hair. He is most likely from the field of physics and tends to conduct experiments in a laboratory. Six prototypes are identified: the patriotic scientist, the stubborn scientist, the elite scientist, the scientist as adventurer, the helpless scientist, and the mad scientist. The patriotic scientist is specific to the Chinese context and predominates in realistic films. In comparison, the science fiction films show more diversity in representing scientists. Finally, we discuss similarities and differences in the cinematic representation of scientists in China and in the West.",

          "abstract": "Sociotechnical imaginaries of gene editing in food and agriculture reflect and shape culturally particular understandings of what role technology should play in an ideal agrifood future. This study employs a comparative media content analysis to identify sociotechnical imaginaries of agricultural gene editing and the actors who perform them in five countries with contrasting regulatory and cultural contexts: Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and the United States. We find that news media in these countries reinforce a predominantly positive portrayal of the technology’s future, although variations in which imaginaries are most mobilized exist based on the regulatory status of gene editing and unique histories of civil society engagement around biotechnology in each country. We argue that by granting legitimacy to some narratives over others, the media supports gene editing as a desirable and necessary component of future agrifood systems, thereby limiting consideration of broader issues related to the technology’s development and application.",

          "authors": "Sai Wang",
          "abstract": "While online hate speech has become a serious problem in multimedia environments, most studies in this area have examined text-based hateful content, with less attention paid to its other visual aspects. From a multimodal perspective, we conducted an online experiment ( N = 799) to investigate how multimodal hate speech (i.e., text and images presented together to convey hateful meanings) on social media affected users’ prejudicial attitudes and prosocial behavioral intentions. The results showed that participants in the text-plus-image (vs. text-only) condition felt more sympathy, which led to less implicit prejudice toward the target group and more prosocial behavioral intentions. In addition, exposure to text-plus-image hate speech had an indirect effect on prosocial behavioral intentions through sympathy and implicit prejudice. The findings contribute to scholarship on online hate speech and provide insights into the affect heuristics that individuals rely on when processing multimodal information.",

          "authors": "Sunny Yoon",
          "abstract": "Webtoons optimize interactivity and participation of media users in the world of digital media by consolidating a unique digital culture. This article examines the role of users in interactive media by exploring the case of webtoons in the context of a changing global political economy and cultural dominance. Korean platform monopolies have established a new business model for webtoons and developed it as a center of Korean creative power. While webtoons have increasingly expanded and attracted the global market and the global audience, some persistent social issues remain, including the precarious labor structure, monopolistic power in the industry, and ideological dominance in content. Although webtoon viewers are often recognized as cultural intermediaries and powerful agents for their contributions to interactive creativity, their role has fluctuated according to changing political-economic structures and industrial strategies. In the course of expanding to the global market and to new business areas such as intellectual property (IP), webtoons have evolved in new fashions while disclosing the ambivalent nature of participatory media and digital interactivity. This article elucidates the double faces of interactive creativity focusing on viewers’ participation in webtoon production in the context of changing webtoon industry and growing partnership with global media.",

          "abstract": "Social media offer opportunities for companies to promote their image, but companies online also risk being denounced if their actions do not align with their words. The rise of social media bots amplifies this risk, as it becomes possible to automate such efforts to highlight corporate hypocrisy. Our experimental survey demonstrated that bots and human actors who confront a corporation touting their commitment to equality by calling out organizational pay gaps damage perceptions of the corporation, heighten anger toward them, and ultimately can elicit boycott intentions. These hypocrisy challenges are equally effective when they come from bots and user accounts. Challenges to hypocritical behavior on social media are consequential and require further exploration.",

          "authors": "Lina Buttgereit, Michael Hameleers, Katjana Gattermann, Andreas Schuck",
          "abstract": "Media criticism is a crucial part of meta-journalistic discourse, ensuring that journalists adhere to their democratic functions, such as informing citizens in an honest and complete manner. However, the profession increasingly faces hostile, nonevidence-based attacks from politicians that attempt to strategically fuel distrust among citizens and delegitimize opposed viewpoints. Despite this reality, we lack a systematic overview of the boundaries between constructive feedback and weaponized attacks in media criticism. To address this gap, we inductively analyzed how media criticism is represented within the social media discourse of ten German politicians from all major parties. Using a grounded theory approach, we conducted a qualitative content analysis of a subset of their tweets from 2015, 2017, and 2022 that contain media criticism ( N = 545), mapping the types and severity of the criticism, the construction of opposing narratives, and the explicitness of references to facticity over opinions. We identified four themes within media criticism discourse, ranging from misinformation attributions to severe accusations of the intentional distortion of reality through the media. Politicians (strategically) employ a wide range of media criticism and inaccuracy claims beyond judgments of facticity with differing degrees of severity for the profession. Based on our findings, we propose a typology of media criticism from political elites that adds nuance to our understanding regarding the boundaries between supportive and disruptive criticism for journalism.",
