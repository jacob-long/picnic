          "authors": "Saskia Witteborn",
          "abstract": "This article explores the ethnographic principle of contextualized meaning-making across traditional, digital, and artificial intelligence-based ethnographies. It approaches context from the perspective of language and social interaction, demonstrating how context is constituted through language and communicative practices in embodied, digital, and computational settings. The review addresses the challenges of defining context, emphasizing its dynamic nature. Moreover, the article advocates for a nuanced understanding of context and situated meaning-making to navigate the social, technical, and ethical complexities of machine-generated communication. Ethical considerations include the ongoing need for ethnographies that document the richness of situated human interactions in light of the automated extraction of linguistic and cultural capital, as well as the importance of participatory data stewardship.",

          "authors": "Emma Weitkamp, Andy Ridgway, Luisa Massarani, Luiz Neves, Shalini Sharma, Cleiton Bezerra",
          "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and particularly Generative AI, such as ChatGPT, has attracted attention within the media recently, both in terms of the potential negative (e.g. job losses, promotion of misinformation) and positive (e.g. enhanced efficiency, easy access to information) impacts on various sectors of society. We explore science journalists’ views of AI and how they are adopting and using these new technologies. A survey methodology allowed exploration of differences between journalists in Brazil, India and the UK. The study found widespread adoption of AI tools for relatively straightforward and simple tasks (e.g. transcription, writing support). Although there is an appetite for more sophisticated use (e.g. data analysis), fears around the accuracy of AI appear to temper adoption. Significant differences were seen in the adoption of AI tools across countries, with Brazilian science journalists more widely adopting tools to support writing in a second language and journalists and India and Brazil making more widespread use of sophisticated tools than those in the UK. British journalists appeared more reticent to adopt AI tools. The study captures a transition in science journalism practices; increases in the capabilities of AI are changing working practices. Our findings indicate that the complexity of AI and its potential lack of compatibility with journalistic values, such as accountability, are at least partially responsible for the lack of use of AI for more sophisticated journalistic tasks.",

          "authors": "Andrei Zanescu",
          "abstract": "As videogame awards shows garner increasing viewership numbers while seeking to canonize a version of the games industry, much of the early years of these ventures remain understudied. In particular, The Game Awards (2014–2024) and the D.I.C.E. Awards (1998–2024) have an antecedent program produced by the first incarnation of the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences (AIAS): Cybermania ’94. Set up by entertainment lawyer Andrew S. Zucker, through the founding of the AIAS, Cybermania sought out to tie games to older media industries, by way of the Emmys and Oscars. This paper argues that Zucker’s vision of legitimacy for videogames was rooted in classical Hollywood, which provides both a shape for the show, and a mechanism for transferring cultural capital from actors, directors and musicians towards videogame producers, programmers and hackers. Further, Cybermania provides a contradictory and messy look at the early years of game awards jockeying, where different bodies fought each other for screen time, as well as the disparaging and celebratory attitudes of hosts and presenters. Through thick description, and unit analysis, the purpose of this piece is to consolidate information about this first awards show, from its early inception to its staging, to its immediate reception, and finally to its long-tail effects. Although Cybermania may appear as a kitsch affair, its stated impact both by AIAS members today, and TGA producer Geoff Keighley, belie deeper links between Hollywood studios and the nascent game industry of the early 90s. Recontextualizing the show will allow scholars to ground future analyses of game awards shows in their originating event, for better or for worse.",

          "authors": "Shin Haeng Lee, Daseul Oh",
          "abstract": "YouTube’s multilayered ecology enables K-pop virality to evolve from grassroots remix to corporate-driven promotion; however, how the meso-level interplay between gatekeepers and memes shapes user engagement remains under-explored. To bridge this gap, we applied an integrated media consumption/choice theoretical approach and a rhizome perspective to commenter-overlap networks for four COVID-era hits— Rollin’ , After LIKE , Attention , and Event Horizon. We then estimated exponential random graph models to contrast top-down promotion with bottom-up sharing. Three key findings emerged. First, mid-tier channels act as decisive brokers. Situated between entertainment mega-channels and grassroots creators, they fuse otherwise disconnected subnetworks, a capacity that scales with event magnitude and drives mass virality. Second, meme genres foster engagement, but do so homophilously: commenter overlaps concentrate within the same meme type, confirming that memes are catalysts of participatory rather than top-down, diffusion. Third, traffic is asymmetrical: links probabilities rise when users move from memes to mid-tier channels, but not vice versa, indicating that meme communities pull attention inward rather than gatekeepers pushing it outward. The results show that K-pop visibility is continuously negotiated between platform-level concentration anchored by elite hubs and rhizomatic diversification orchestrated by meme-driven mid-tier actors. By refining political-economy accounts of algorithmic dominance, the study offers empirical evidence for policy aimed at safeguarding cultural diversity within platform-dominated music industries.",

          "authors": "Christian Weining, Melanie Wald-Fuhrmann, Sophie Stielow, Martin Kreuzer, Martin Tröndle",
          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has given a boost to the audiovisual streaming of classical concerts – a cultural practice long entrenched in the analog. While opportunities and problems for the convergence of classical concert culture and the digital sphere are already discussed in research and practice, the debate about the future of this trend lacks a unified starting point. Addressing this, the present article examines classical music performance practice in digital forms by presenting a systematization of the field of practice and a comprehensive literature overview. For the systematization, different types of streaming platforms for classical concerts are categorized along dimensions of streaming. Additionally, ideal-typical digital concert formats are described based on examples ( user-generated concert , conventional digital concert , concert film , concert show ). The literature section summarizes previous publications, from the perspective of both production and reception of audiovisual concert streaming. Subsequently, research foci are identified. With suggestions for future research and outlooks into future scenarios for digital concerts, the scientific and practical analyses are synthesized. Mapping the emerging field of audiovisual digital concerts, this article serves as a starting point and a framework for further debates on digital classical concerts and other forms of digital performance practice.",

          "authors": "Pat O’Grady, Lachlan Goold",
          "abstract": "Over a decade has passed since Eliot Bates examined ‘what studios do’. In the meantime, discussions surrounding decline and transformation in music production often depict a grim outlook for the future of large-format recording studios confluent with a burgeoning lower-cost, DAW-based DIY recording sector. This paper conducts a census of commercial recording studios along the east coast of Australia by gathering data from their websites. This approach offers a methodology to study recording studio cultures and explore what studios think they do. It offers insights into how studios present, communicate and promote themselves to prospective clients. The language used, promoted equipment and services offered all convey a particular position in the recording domain, with the goal of future business and stability for the studio. Beyond functional goals a recording studio purports to achieve, this article contends that studios don’t share a standard format of practice, they rely equally on the personnel that own and operate the facility and the technology within, they do not adequately acknowledge structural diversity issues in the sector, they assume that potential clients understand the value of specific technology, and they are diversifying beyond standard modes of practice to remain a viable business.",

          "abstract": "Phubbing has become a prominent phenomenon in today’s digital landscape, with detrimental effects on relational well-being. Beyond its negative impact on various types of relationships, scholarly interest has been paid to the influence of phubbing on impression formation. Drawing on the Stereotype Content Model, which highlights the roles of warmth and competence in social perception and evaluation, this study examined how phubbing affects these dimensions and subsequently influences social attractiveness, likability, and interaction intentions. Two experiments were conducted. Study 1 found that phubbing significantly reduced perceptions of warmth and competence, which led to lower social attractiveness, likability, and interaction intentions. Serial mediation analysis confirmed the mediating roles of warmth, competence, and social attractiveness. In Study 2, moderated mediation analyses demonstrated that contextual information significantly moderated these effects. These findings offer important theoretical and practical implications by clarifying the psychological mechanisms through which phubbing harms social evaluations and undermines relational well-being.",

          "authors": "Michael Skey",
          "abstract": "This article offers two key contributions. First, it provides a novel approach to theorising the relationship between media and nationalism by drawing on the concept of entitativity to explore the ways in which mainstream media represent individual nations as ‘entities’ operating in a largely taken-for-granted inter national system. In doing so, it also addresses a largely overlooked question within the wider psychological literature on entitativity; how it might be possible to view the largest, most complex and, sometimes, divided social groups as entities. The second part of the article seeks to provide evidence to support these arguments by drawing on two data sets. The first involves a systematic content analysis of everyday media reporting during an ‘ordinary’ period. The second provides an overview of coverage of a major media event. Interestingly, while the relevance of two existing category groups, character and dynamic, is noted in relation to the major event, a new ‘discursive’ category is introduced to capture the manifold ways in which language and symbols are routinely used to represent nations as entities.",

A two-year content analysis ( N = 221 articles) tracks shifts in frame use, primary sources and tone toward competing sovereignty claims. Across outlets the conflict frame dominated, while economic considerations were marginal; security and humanitarian emphases declined after the policy shift. El País and ABC partially converged, normalizing official narratives despite opposing editorial leanings. Público relied more on NGOs and Sahrawi actors and maintained the most consistently pro-Sahrawi tone. Findings lend support to concerns about elite cueing and overreliance on official narratives in the Spanish press, but show that meaningful disparities remain among newspapers with different ideological orientations.",

          "abstract": "Throughout literary history, the space of the forest has been associated with uncertainty and mystery. This association endures in the digital forests of modern video games, but it also acquires new meanings as the unpredictability of algorithmic systems converges with questions about environmental crisis. Inspired by discussions on ecogaming as well as philosophical arguments on forests as multispecies communities, this article examines various ways in which growing or exploring digital forests can speak to a fundamental uncertainty in human-nonhuman relations. In mobile games that adopt a “play-to-plant” model (e.g., EverForest , Longleaf Valley , Forest ), digital forestry holds out a promise of direct real-world intervention that tends to elide the ethical uncertainties underlying gameplay. By contrast, in the survival game The Forest the AI shaping the behavior of nonplayer characters adapts to the ecological impact of the player's in-game actions, explicitly bringing together algorithmic unpredictability and the possibility of more-than-human community.",

          "abstract": "As digital technologies increasingly permeate everyday life, concerns about privacy, surveillance, and algorithmic control have become central to contemporary society. Fictional narratives, particularly in science fiction games, reflect and simulate these concerns, depicting privacy as both a vulnerable right and a commodified asset. This paper examines how video games incorporate surveillance not only through narrative and aesthetics but also through artificial intelligence (AI)-driven systems that track, model, and adapt to player behavior as part of the act of play. Drawing on Foucault’s disciplinary power, Deleuze’s control societies, and Zuboff’s surveillance capitalism, we analyze how games such as Little Nightmares , The Sims , and Cobra Club stage surveillance as atmospheric discipline, everyday normalization, and networked consent. We extend Bogost’s notion of procedural rhetoric with Galloway’s concept of the allegorithm to show how games make ethical arguments through code as well as story. We argue that such games function as laboratories for AI ethics, foregrounding issues of consent, transparency, and autonomy, and propose a procedural ethics of transparency for understanding how play both rehearses and resists algorithmic governance.",

Specifically, the article is concerned with the concept of performer aesthetics: the qualities that emerge from direct experience of performing a sporting movement. Selecting the golf swing as a case study, this article draws on the philosophy of sport to develop a hermeneutic analysis of performed golf swings across a selection of golf simulation games, from mainstream console titles through motion-controlled games, driving range games, and games controlled by touch. Framed by the author’s own lived experience of golf participation, this article draws attention to the tensions that can arise between theory and intuition, quantification of movement and quality of experience, when sporting actions are adapted into digital play.",

          "title": "Unveiling the impact of blockchain affordances on knowledge hiding: a three-wave cross-cultural study",
          "authors": "Fulya Acikgoz, Sophie Lythreatis, Yang Shen",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study examines the influence of blockchain affordances – transparency, traceability and immutability – on perceptions of fairness and their role in mitigating knowledge hiding in organizations. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on affordance theory, we develop and test a model using three-wave survey data from employees in the United States and China, representing culturally and economically distinct contexts. Findings The results show that blockchain affordances, which reduce ambiguity in organizational processes, provide accurate and accountable record-keeping, and protect the integrity of records and decisions, positively affect perceived fairness, which, in turn, significantly reduces knowledge-hiding behavior. Practical implications Organizations can strategically implement blockchain technology to promote fairness, thereby creating open and collaborative environments by reducing knowledge hiding. This study offers a cross-cultural perspective, providing insights into how blockchain technology affordances operate across different regulatory and cultural settings. Originality/value There is limited empirical evidence on how blockchain affordances influence employees' knowledge-hiding behavior. This paper addresses this gap by examining how blockchain affordances – transparency, traceability and immutability – affect knowledge hiding in organizational settings. This research contributes to the blockchain literature by shifting the focus from technical applications to behavioral implications, highlighting how blockchain affordances can address complex organizational challenges. Furthermore, it extends the knowledge-hiding literature by introducing blockchain as a novel driver of fairness and collaboration.",

          "title": "Unlocking engagement: how employees experience organizational social platforms",
          "authors": "Mohamed Mohiya",
          "abstract": "Purpose Organizational Social Platforms (OSPs) are modern HR digital tools introduced to enhance and promote employee engagement in the workplace. While they hold significant promise, organizations often face difficulties in achieving genuine and sustained engagement through these platforms. Guided by Social Exchange Theory (SET), this study examines how internally developed Organizational Social Platforms (OSPs)—distinct from outsourced or vendor-managed platforms—are operationalized in organizational settings. Design/methodology/approach Adopting a mixed-methods approach, the study draws on two data sources: semi-structured interviews with 27 employees and a longitudinal qualitative content analysis of 288 typewritten comments submitted over two years. Thematic analysis was employed to identify patterns and insights regarding employee engagement with OSPs. Findings The findings reveal that employer-driven content delays (24–48 h) significantly inhibited reciprocal interactions and discouraged employee participation. The findings indicate that employee disengagement frequently emerges from managerial misimplementation and mismanagement, thereby creating a substantial disconnect between the intended functions of OSPs and employees’ lived experiences. These practices diminish trust, limit reciprocity—central to SET—and ultimately reduce platform participation. Furthermore, the lack of employee involvement in the design phase, insufficient communication of platform objectives, and organizational unpreparedness contribute to the platforms’ failure. Practical implications The findings offer important HR implications, particularly for the design and management of HR technologies that shape employee relations and workplace engagement. The study shows that Organizational Social Platforms (OSPs) are most effective when HR adopts an employee-centred approach, involving staff early in design and implementation to ensure platform features reflect actual communication and engagement needs rather than managerial assumptions. Clear and transparent communication of policies—especially those related to content moderation, data use, and participation—can strengthen trust and reduce perceptions of control. Sustained engagement also requires continuous technical and organizational support, alongside granting employees meaningful autonomy to create and interact with content. These actions help position OSPs as genuine tools for collaboration rather than compliance. Overall, the implications directly address the challenges identified in this study, including filtration practices, technical constraints, and limited interactivity, offering actionable guidance for organizations aiming to introduce or improve OSPs. Social implications Unlike other technological work-related systems in the workplace, OSP is a social application heavily dependent on employees’ voluntary social interactions. Technological studies often equate “user” with engagement, but employees’ roles in OSPs extend beyond that of generic users. Employees in OSP, unlike public users, have specific needs and expectations related to their workplace issues within OSP. Originality/value The study concludes that the socio-technical mismanagement of OSPs undermines their role as tools for engagement. It contributes to the literature by extending SET within digital HRM, showcasing a novel dual-source qualitative approach, and offering actionable insights to improve OSP design, implementation, and governance.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Drawing insights from the transactional theory of stress (TTS) and the personality traits lens, our study aims to develop an integrative theoretical framework to explore how employees with distinct personality traits of extraversion and conscientiousness appraise stress from generative AI (GenAI) creation capability. Design/methodology/approach A research model was developed to examine how employees appraise GenAI creation capability. A survey was conducted among 320 full-time employees who have used GenAI during work, and the structural equation modeling technique was used to examine the proposed research model. Findings The empirical research findings indicate that extraverted employees tend to appraise GenAI creation capability as a challenge, which further increases their creativity. The post-hoc analysis further reveals that the hindrance appraisal mediates the relationship between GenAI creation capability and creativity for conscientious employees. Research limitations/implications Despite the contributions of this study, there are several limitations. First, this study does not incorporate coping appraisals. Second, control variables cannot capture the complexity of individual differences in responding to GenAI-related stress. Third, we measured hindrance appraisal by calculating the inverse of challenge appraisal items, which may limit the detection of complex relationships between stressors and appraisals. Fourth, future studies can focus on older employees aged above 50. Practical implications Our study can provide guidelines for managers to promote the use of GenAI while mitigating potential stress for their employees. Originality/value Our study enriches the interpretation of TTS and personality traits in the context of GenAI.",

          "authors": "Chuan Wang, Yi Liu, Luokanghui Chen, Xiaole Li, Jiannong Shi, Zhen Zhang",
          "abstract": "In everyday life, individuals often face decision-making dilemmas involving the balancing of the interests of close family members such as parents and partners. This conflict is particularly prominent in societies like China, which emphasize filial piety. While previous studies revealed a parental preference in zero sum contexts, the current study explored how Chinese adults make decisions between their parents and partners in non-zero-sum contexts. Participants ( N = 195, ages ranged from 19-53 years) completed the Columbia Card Task, in which participants needed to choose to flip a card (either a gain card or a loss card) or pass in two conditions: parent gains/partner losses and partner gains/parent losses. Particularly, the gains for one party did not necessarily mean equal losses for the other party. If participants prioritized one party, they would flip more often in the condition where that party was the beneficiary. We also examined whether age, gender, relationship stage, as well as relationship quality with parents and partner would moderate the preferences. Results indicated that Chinese adults did demonstrate a preference to prioritize their parents in non-zero-sum decision-making contexts. Moreover, only parent relationship quality significantly moderated the preference: individuals who had average to high levels of relationship quality with parents prioritized their parents, while those with worse relationships with parents considered both parents and partners equally. Overall, the study contributes to the understanding of decision-making process between intergenerational and romantic relationships, shedding light on the complex interplay of cultural values and relationship dynamics in shaping adults’ relational priorities.",

          "authors": "Nikola Kallova, Tomas Prosek, Sadia Zaman",
          "abstract": "This research introduces the Romantic Relationship-Induced Learning Scale (RRILS), designed to measure personal growth, learning, and positive change stemming from romantic and intimate experiences among adults. The RRILS was developed using a triangulation approach, beginning with qualitative responses to generate thematic domains and an item pool, followed by expert validation. This 15-item measure identified three core dimensions of romantic relationship-induced learning: Self-Change, Relational Competence, and Partner Decision Making. Participants from Slovakia took part in two studies and were divided into three subsamples. In the two young adult samples (YA1: n = 392, M age = 22.55, SD = 2.55; YA2: n = 393, M age = 22.64, SD = 2.85), a combined total of 785 individuals participated, of whom 82% identified as women, 16% as men, and 2% as another gender or preferred not to respond. The general population sample included 456 adults ( M age = 38.46, SD = 13.61), with 52% identifying as women, 47% as men, and 2% as another or missing. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a three-factor structure and demonstrated good internal consistency. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the model’s fit, confirming the scale’s structural validity. Convergent validity was assessed through correlations with theoretically related constructs, supporting the instrument’s psychometric soundness, and divergent validity, indicating that the instrument measures a distinct concept. The RRILS provides a linguistically and culturally appropriate tool for capturing how adults learn and grow through romantic experiences.",

          "abstract": "Social motives, such as social admiration, prosocial behavior, and sociability, become increasingly important for emerging adults as they transition into adulthood and must establish their identity and relationships with others. Sibling relationships may assist in this process as closeness between siblings can improve emerging adults’ abilities to problem solve, which serves as a useful skill in social settings. Sibling birth order may also influence how emerging adults perceive their sibling relationships and its effect on their social experiences. This study ( N = 189) examined sibling problem solving as a mediator between closeness with a younger sibling and later social motives, while accounting for parent and peer closeness. Closeness with younger siblings predicted better sibling problem-solving skills, which predicted social admiration, prosocial, but not sociability motives. Results differed between eldest and middle-born siblings. Findings suggest that continued relationships with younger siblings in emerging adulthood may improve social motives, such that constructive and close relationships with siblings should be encouraged to support later social development.",

          "authors": "Evelyn De Simone, Alessia Rochira, Terri Mannarini",
          "abstract": "Sexual objectification, a prevalent form of gender microaggression, has been primarily studied in public and media contexts, with limited attention to interpersonal relationships. This study examines how objectifying patterns manifest within close relationships and their cumulative psychological effects on women. We conducted a qualitative phenomenological analysis of 186 Italian women’s experiences describing personal experiences of sexual objectification across interpersonal contexts. Four distinct relational environments emerged where objectification occurs, each characterized by specific patterns: (1) family contexts involving sexualizing parental messages and appearance-focused praise; (2) peer groups practicing inclusion/exclusion and labeling based on physical appearance; (3) educational settings where attractiveness influences academic evaluation; and (4) workplaces featuring aesthetic job requirements and competency devaluation. Objectification frequently intersected with other microaggressions, including assumptions of inferiority and enforcement of traditional gender roles. Participants reported profound psychological impacts—discomfort, inadequacy, and persistent self-concept alterations—with particularly severe effects when objectification occurred within supposedly safe relationships. These findings highlight objectification’s pervasive nature across women’s relational experiences, and demonstrate how different forms of sexism operate synergistically to maintain gender inequality.

          "authors": "Yulri Kim, Jeong Eun Lee, Joseph Svec, Natasha Nemmers",
          "abstract": "Caregiving is a demanding role that can result in significant psychological strain. Many caregivers experience increased stress, depression, and other negative psychological outcomes due to the intensity and duration of their caregiving responsibilities. Guided by social exchange theory (Thibaut &amp; Kelley, 1959) and the stress process model (Pearlin et al., 1990), this study examines perceived appreciation role as a psychological resource that can impact caregivers’ well-being and work as a positive caregiving environment. Further, we aim to provide insights into gender differences by examining caregiving intensity and perceived appreciation from the caregivers’ perspective. Using data from 2015 and 2017 waves of the National Study of Caregiving (NSOC), we analyzed responses from 3,061 informal caregivers (Mean age = 61.96 years) through moderating regression analysis. Findings indicated that high levels of perceived appreciation mitigate the negative effects of caregiving intensity on role overload while promoting mental health and self-realization. Notably, perceived appreciation promoted self-realization in male caregivers, whereas it more strongly buffered the negative effects of caregiving intensity on mental health and role overload among female caregivers. These results highlight the importance of fostering environments where caregivers feel valued and recognized, with particular attention to gender differences in psychological well-being and caregiving experiences.",

          "abstract": "This study examined the applicability of regularized regression in family science by focusing on fathers’ psychological well-being as an applied example. Using cross-sectional survey data from 277 U.S. fathers, we compared Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression with Ridge, LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), and Elastic Net in regularized regression to evaluate how diverse familial factors—including father involvement, father role identity, parenting competency, parent–child relationships, coparenting relationships, and work–family conflict—concurrently predict fathers’ well-being. Results indicated that while the three regularized approaches produced similar overall performance, they provided advantages over OLS by reducing overfitting, improving generalizability, and enhancing interpretability. We also compared the analysis results of the three approaches in terms of the prediction accuracy and interpretability. The findings reveal how regularized regression can highlight key factors, such as father involvement, coparenting, and parenting competency. This study also illustrates how regularized regression complements traditional regression in family science by addressing multicollinearity, reducing overfitting, and supporting feature selection. These results highlight the potential of computational approaches such as machine learning to strengthen both theory and practice in family research.",

As Black migration to Baltimore accelerated, the Sunpapers— The Sun and The Evening Sun —framed news coverage to valorize white supremacy and justify racial segregation.

          "abstract": "This study explores how VTubers, or virtual YouTubers, redefine digital intimacy by blending human performance with digital artifice. Through a 9-month digital ethnography and 21 interviews with VTuber fans, we identified two key processes. First, the affective liquidity of VTuber personas, facilitated by vocal modulation, avatar aesthetics, and technology, blurs ontological lines between human/non-human and real/virtual. Second, the screen acts as both an immersive portal and a protective buffer, allowing fans to explore non-normative desires and subvert heteronormative gender performativity. We argue that VTubers, as embodiments of posthuman becoming, cultivate synthetic relationships that prioritize fluid belonging over biological essentialism, challenging traditional intimacy models. While acknowledging their transgressive possibilities, we caution against techno-utopianism, highlighting the ethical risks of platformed intimacies. This study advocates a critical posthumanist lens to map the contradictions of digitally mediated relationality, balancing optimism with scrutiny as human-technological assemblages redefine intimacy in the (post-)digital age.",

          "abstract": "Skin tone discrimination—or colorism—is an additional marginalization barrier that People of Color must navigate. Black women, especially those with darker complexions, are often discursively constructed as the antithesis to Western beauty standards—standards that commonly prioritize White femininity as the beauty benchmark. Studies on the beauty influencer economy reveal that Black women remain at a disadvantage in the beauty hierarchy. This study uses a survey experiment to explore how skin tone impacts perceptions of attractiveness and competence among viewers of digital beauty content. Surveying African Americans ( N = 576), primarily Black Women ( n = 524), we found that beauty influencers with darker skin tones are rated as less attractive and less competent. Participants also revealed that they would be less likely to click on the videos of darker skinned beauty influencers in comparison to influencers with lighter brown and medium brown skin tones. These results suggest that, among Black women viewers, preferences for beauty content is skin tone dependent. Because view counts are a significant metric in influencer marketability, viewing disparities along the lines of skin tone have the potential to widen the gap among Black influencers, creating disproportionate opportunities for success within an already marginalized population.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the contemporary revival of Sony’s MiniDisc format through the lens of ‘speculative nostalgia’, a mode of engagement with obsolete technologies that activates unfinished or ‘lost’ futures rather than recreating past experiences. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with music industry professionals and analysis of online communities, the research demonstrates how MiniDisc users frame engagement with this ‘failed’ technology as symbolic resistance to frictionless consumption in an algorithmic culture. Unlike vinyl’s commercial resurgence or cassette culture’s established nostalgia markets, the MiniDisc occupies a marginal space at the fringes of market logics, enabling practices that imagine alternative pathways for media engagement. Its hybrid materiality–both physical and digital–produces productive friction that interrupts the continuous flow of streaming. The paper contributes to format theory and nostalgia studies by arguing that technological failure offers alternative cultural possibilities through embodied, material and ritualistic music practices that challenge the logics of platform capitalism.",

          "abstract": "On social media, posting positive content should generate positive emotions via emotional contagion. Yet, emerging discussions regarding toxic positivity (TP) suggest that positivity can backfire, showing the limits of emotional contagion. Through the perspective of neoliberal self-help ideology, this research investigated how people understand and perceive TP. Study 1 found, via focus groups, that social media posts containing TP involve two message characteristics—overgeneralization and commanding words—and two psychological processes—ignoring negativity and perceived poster privilege. Additionally, post ephemerality mitigates the negative effects of TP. Study 2 experimentally tested these findings. It found that the effect of post positivity (low positivity / high positivity / toxic positivity message characteristics) on post liking was mediated by ignoring negativity and perceived privilege . However, ephemerality did not moderate the aforementioned mediation relationships. Therefore, the concepts associated with TP—overgeneralization, commanding words, ignoring negativity, and perceived privilege—can be understood as boundary conditions for online emotional contagion.",

However, little education research has been done on how adolescents in general – including Black adolescents – learn the skills involved in these activities. Through analyzing data from the nationally representative National Survey of Critical Digital Literacy, this 7-day daily diary study found that Black and Latinx youth reported significantly higher daily frequencies of practicing critical race digital literacy skills than their White counterparts. Enactment of these skills also varied by day of the week and was reported more on weekdays than on weekends. These findings show that Black adolescents have practices of critical digital literacy skills they can build upon, and suggest White adolescents need additional support in developing these skills.",

Likes and affirming replies were commonplace, whereas Dislikes and negation replies were rare. Getting Likes and affirming replies decreased subsequent toxicity in the short term, as did getting no responses whatsoever. Getting Dislikes increased the hatefulness of users’ next original post and their posts over the next 3 months. Results challenge both the social approval theory of online hate and the need-threat approach to effects of responses to social media hate posting.",

          "abstract": "This article theorizes how platform infrastructures produce epistemic churn—a condition in which publics remain caught in unresolved cycles of interpretation. Unlike models centered on belief accuracy or convergence, epistemic churn explains how infrastructures govern not what is believed, but whether belief stabilizes at all. We argue that churn emerges from engineered turbulence—systemic interventions that modulate epistemic friction (the difficulty of reaching interpretive closure), delaying stabilization while sustaining engagement. To render churn empirically tractable, we propose a family of methods that can both test the theory and provide qualitative nuance on its mechanics. Situating churn within a broader theory of communicative governance, the article reframes communication theory by showing how infrastructures sustain engagement by prolonging interpretive labor. Normatively, it shows how platforms govern not by silencing expression but by deferring belief formation, a subtle form of power with profound consequences for democratic life and collective agency.",

We examine themes’ ability to sustain engagement, showing that sexual behavior and market-value topics generate the most replies, while attraction-focused content and deliberative topics generate the fewest. Gender- and norm-related discussions tend to self-reinforce, whereas attraction-related threads diffuse into broader debates.

To do so, we theorise ‘contextualised digital play drivers’, understood as children’s own accounts, or adults’ interpretations, of the deep interests, needs and desires their play appears to fulfil. This approach moves beyond dominant lenses focused on individual autonomy, offering a more situated reading acknowledging the individual and contextual circumstances shaping digital play. Eleven contextualised digital play drivers are identified and discussed in relation to children’s well-being.

          "abstract": "Although AI-driven fact-checking has been extensively applied on social media, it is unclear whether presenting AI rather than humans (e.g. social media platform administrators) as a fact-checker will affect people’s credibility perceptions of misinformation. Furthermore, most studies on machine heuristics have mainly focused on the positive machine heuristic and neglected the negative machine heuristic. In this study, a between-subjects online experiment was conducted to address these gaps in knowledge. The results show that presenting AI rather than platform administrators as fact-checkers indirectly led participants to perceive false short-form health videos as more credible via the mediation of the negative machine heuristic rather than the positive machine heuristic. In addition, among participants who initially held a stronger belief in misinformation, the fact-checking provided by AI (vs administrator) generated even more negative machine heuristic, which further led them to perceive the false videos as more credible.",

Users’ assumption of these influences raises for them critical concerns about privacy, transparency, information insularity, targeted data manipulation, and the reproduction of societal biases in Autocomplete’s outputs. My analysis also shows that users view explanations as a promising mechanism to enhance accountability in Autocomplete systems.

Analyzing more than 20 million block log entries from 2004 to 2024, the study identifies shifts in block frequency, duration, and stated rationales. A significant increase in preemptive, automated blocking of open proxies since 2020 accounts for most block activity, but excluding these reveals a broader trend toward longer blocks and vaguer rationales such as “disruption.” These patterns suggest that volunteers are scaling labor through automation and normative adjustment, trading openness for efficiency and stability.

          "abstract": "Singlehood is becoming a more visible lifestyle option in many nations worldwide. Despite this, there has been little research on the cultural factors that influence well‐being in singlehood. Filial piety, a key virtue within Chinese culture, emphasizes respect, obedience, and care toward one's elders. Filial piety may be associated with lower well‐being in singlehood as individuals may perceive their singlehood status as a failure to fulfill familial marital expectations. This negative link between filial piety and singles' well‐being may be partly offset by a closer connection with family (and thus higher well‐being) that is also associated with endorsement of filial piety. We investigated the associations of Chinese singles' authoritarian and reciprocal filial piety beliefs with family life satisfaction and well‐being in singlehood (i.e., desire for a partner, satisfaction with singlehood, fear of being single). Data from two samples (total N = 1655) revealed a statistical suppression effect suggesting that an overall negative relation between reciprocal filial piety and well‐being in singlehood was partly offset by filial piety's relation to higher satisfaction with family life. We discuss the notion that pressure for singles to partner may often be embedded in relationships that simultaneously make singles' lives better.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how climate change is visually framed on Twitter/X and how these frames influence users’ emotional responses and engagement across languages. Using automated image analysis of over three million images posted between 2019 and 2022, we identify nine dominant visual frames. “Public Engagement: Politics &amp; Events” was most prevalent, interactive visuals such as memes generated the highest engagement but predominantly negative response in user comments. By contrast, we find more positive responses for solution-focused frames, but lower levels of engagement. These results underscore the value of automated image analysis in uncovering culturally nuanced patterns in visual climate communication.",

          "authors": "Luiz Gustavo de Almeida, Ronaldo Pilati",
          "abstract": "Trust in scientists is a communicative construct shaped by public perception of scientists. Using network psychometrics on responses from 71,922 individuals in 68 countries, we model trust as an interconnected community system of attitudes and beliefs. Sincerity emerges as the most central node, linking perceptions of competence, integrity, and goodwill. This dynamic structure challenges reflective latent models and emphasizes trust as a product of message framing and credibility cues. Our findings inform science communication theory by reframing trust as an emergent network and offer practical guidance for communicators seeking to design inclusive, trust-enhancing strategies across diverse sociocultural contexts.",

          "authors": "Hongkun Wang, Jiang Chang",
          "abstract": "This article examines everyday feminism on RedNote (Xiaohongshu) through the lens of affective politics, exploring how feminists repurpose a consumerist digital platform to cultivate feminist publics within a socio-political environment that is largely unreceptive. The analysis reveals that mediated intimacy underpins the everyday practices of RedNote feminists, facilitating the formation of intimate publics. These practices strategically engage the platform’s vernacular to articulate a “lifestyle feminism,” framing feminist politics as a non-confrontational, identity-based lifestyle rather than an overt ideological stance. While this approach nurtures a popularized feminist enclave, it is accompanied by inherent tensions: limited intersectionality, insularity, and susceptibility to platform co-optation may transform this ostensibly empowering mode of feminist politics into its opposite, inadvertently contributing to the depoliticization and censorship it seeks to resist.",

          "authors": "Lanabi La Lova",
          "abstract": "This study investigates Russian television coverage of Ukraine between 2009 and 2019, drawing on a dataset of over 2.3 million news episodes from eight major television networks and one news agency (Interfax), including both state-controlled and relatively independent outlets. Combining natural language processing techniques with a quasi-experimental design, the analysis traces changes in content patterns over time. The results provide strong evidence consistent with the first hypothesis: following a state-enforced management change at RBC TV in 2016, the network increased the share of news coverage primarily focused on Ukraine by up to 40 percent, depending on the assumed treatment date. Evidence for the second hypothesis—which posits that RBC’s reporting would become more similar to state-controlled outlets—remains only partial. Cosine similarity analysis shows that RBC’s content became more similar to several state-controlled outlets while diverging from relatively independent TV Rain (Dozhd). Sentiment-polarity analysis indicates that RBC’s coverage became modestly more negative after the takeover. These findings suggest that content changes following institutional intervention may reflect increased alignment with state-linked narratives while preserving outlet-specific variation. The study contributes to research on media alignment in autocratic contexts by analyzing a single-case pattern and highlights both the potential and limitations of computational text analysis in examining large-scale trends in state media coverage.",
