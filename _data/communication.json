          "abstract": "The media portray older adults stereotypically, making it critical to study the influence of different media forms’ portrayals on age stereotypes. This study advances dynamic age-group dissociation as a novel theoretical framework, integrating social identity, self-categorization, meta-stereotype, and communication accommodation theories to explore how older Chinese adults navigate conflicting age portrayals across hybrid media ecosystems. Through in-depth interviews with 15 retirees, findings reveal that both traditional media and social media simultaneously reinforce positive and negative age-related stereotypes. Older adults actively negotiate their self-perception, selectively aligning with or distancing from these portrayals based on their lived experiences and cultural norms. These findings illuminate the intersectional influence of media on identity construction, with significant implications for communication theory.",

          "abstract": "The current transformations in how audiences are datafied, including how that data is then traded and sold, used in various algorithms and AI models, and executed on to shape our media ecosystems, necessitate renewed frameworks for conceptualizing these datafied audience ontologies, which we refer to in this issue as ‘big data audiences’. Big data audiences are the lifeblood of the contemporary digital media ecosystem, with significant epistemic and cultural consequences that social scientists and humanists have not sufficiently grappled with. While political economy remains central to understanding the contemporary contexts of audience datafication, this issue demonstrates how theories and methods from the domains of social and humanistic research are equally essential for conceptualizing big data audiences. The issue brings together a range of methodological approaches and aims to catalyze critical media scholarship on audiences that explores the industrial and cultural aspects of datafied audience ontologies in media industries big and small across the globe.",

          "authors": "Jennifer Hessler",
          "abstract": "The defining feature of the Nielsen ratings has always been that they derive from a statistically sampled panel of viewers. Even amid the firm’s turn to a panel/big data-integrated currency, Nielsen claims its viewer panel is the thing that sets them apart from their third-party competitors because of its capacity to ground and calibrate the disarray of platform-derived proprietary data. In this article, I discuss Nielsen’s new panel/big data integrated currency, which integrates viewer-panel data and big data with AI modeling to create a composite of US viewership. More specifically, I analyze how Nielsen has discursively reframed the value of their viewer panel in terms of its capacity to assist data personification. The word ‘personification’ describes the process of mapping human qualities back onto big data via machine learning systems. In reality, the process of personification scales and abstracts data in such a way that the output no longer bares a direct tie to a person. To illustrate the socio-cultural stakes of this, I detail three of the machine learning processes that Nielsen characterizes as ‘personification’: ID Graphing, Demographic Modelling, and Scaling Persona Profiles. I also analyze the particularly neo-liberal rhetorical work that Nielsen does to mythologize these AI processes of personification as socially beneficial.",

          "authors": "Claudio Celis Bueno, Steve Jankowski, Jakko Kemper",
          "abstract": "This article contends that the promises and perils that people ascribe to so-called generative AI are in fact not so singular and that the debates around AI and the arts can be situated within a longer discursive lineage. We claim that antithetical responses to emerging new media historically tend to activate a perceived schism between culture and technique. As such, whenever a new technology appears to impact the artistic process, there is a tendency to present human culture as a constellation of specific friction-laden tasks that should either be protected from or supplanted by technology. To support this claim, we engage in a ‘topos study’ ( Huhtamo, 1997 ) to compare current discourses on the effects of generative AI on the arts with debates about the relationship between media and art that took place nearly two hundred years ago: François Arago’s 1839 report on the daguerreotype and Charles Baudelaire’s 1859 denunciation of photography. We identify four recurring topological commonplaces – usefulness of a new medium for the arts , democratization through technological means , antagonism between industrialization and art , and the impoverishment of artistic imagination , and argue that, when combined, they contain discursive contradictions about friction and frictionlessness that historically define the meanings ascribed to technology and its impact on the realm of culture.",

          "authors": "José Rúas-Araújo, Talía Rodríguez-Martelo, Marius Dragomir",
          "abstract": "Regional broadcast media comprises a substantial sector across Europe, encompassing thousands of players and drawing on considerable public funds. Yet, as the media landscape becomes an increasingly crowded field and the competitive heat from tech giants ratchets up, the need for media companies to sharpen their edge will only intensify. Gaining that competitive vantage requires embracing innovative practices and business models—especially as the relentless wave of innovation, often bankrolled by large tech corporations, continues to wash over the industry. Drawing on insights from interviews with representatives of member organizations under CIRCOM-Regional, Europe's largest association of regional broadcasters, this article sheds light on how regional public service media grapple with innovation. Despite widespread awareness of its significance, the findings suggest that many regional broadcasters lag behind in fully embracing the concept. Only a rare few boast dedicated teams or resources for innovation. In most cases, progress is driven through technological enhancements and organizational openness, while strategic policies and long-term investment plans often fall by the wayside.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The study aims to examine the correlates of work-related social media use. Specifically, it investigates the role of work-related social media use (WRSMU) and frequency of social media use (FSMU) in the relationship between workplace fear of missing out (FoMO), organizational support, innovative performance, and routine performance at the workplace. Design/methodology/approach A sample of 245 employees from India working in various organizations. The data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings The findings indicate that work-related social media use has a positive and significant association with innovative and routine performance. Additionally, organizational support is positively and significantly associated with work-related social media use and performance. Workplace fear of missing out is positively associated with work-related social media use, but not with performance. The mediation analysis showed that work-related social media use mediates between workplace FoMO and performance, and organizational support and performance. Furthermore, moderation analysis revealed that the frequency of social media use moderates between work-related social media use and innovative performance. Originality/value This study’s findings provide new insights into the impact of social media use on individual and organizational functioning. This study demonstrates this impact and contributes to the existing literature on the social and cultural impacts of information technology.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to investigate emerging technologies and their impact on establishing a digital campus in academic institutions. It seeks to understand the barriers and opportunities associated with digitalization in education and propose an inclusive digital learning framework for academicians. Design/methodology/approach Online-focused group discussions (O-FGDs) were conducted with education experts to gain insights into the phenomena of digital learning. The discussions explored the potential barriers to digitalization and strategies for successful implementation. Additionally, Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Situation analysis was performed to select the most significant factors among those reported by the respondents. Findings The study revealed that digitalization is a crucial factor in the establishment of a digital campus. However, cultural diversity and multilingualism were identified as having the lowest relative closeness. The O-FGDs highlighted the need for inclusive digital learning frameworks that consider the impacting factors to ensure equitable implementation of digital strategies. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature by providing a comprehensive understanding of emerging technologies and their implications for academic institutions. It offers a practical framework for implementing inclusive digital strategies that address the challenges and opportunities associated with digitalization in education.",

          "authors": "Yi Wu, Zhimei Wen, Xiaopan Wang, Yangsheng Zhang, Ben Choi",
          "abstract": "Purpose Equity crowdfunding is an increasingly vital source of financing for startup companies. To attract early investors and take advantage of an observed herding effect in online crowdfunding, platforms have introduced the promotional strategy of “early bird” terms (EBT). Based on signaling theory, we investigate the influence EBT has on crowdfunding performance and post-investment engagement, and the moderating role of valuation. Design/methodology/approach We empirically tested a set of hypotheses by analyzing archival data from a leading equity crowdfunding platform that had implemented EBT. Findings We find EBT has significant negative impacts on fundraising performance and investors' post-investment engagement, which is detrimental to sustaining long-term investor interest in the campaign. In addition, enterprise valuation amplifies the negative relationship between EBT and fundraising performance, but does not significantly affect post-investment engagement. Practical implications To enhance equity crowdfunding outcomes, platforms should regulate EBT use, improve campaign vetting, and monitor incentive impacts. Entrepreneurs must balance EBT's appeal with valuation consistency. Investors, especially novices, should evaluate EBT critically, focusing on campaign fundamentals and long-term value to avoid being misled by short-term, superficial cues. Originality/value This study enriches existing literature on online crowdfunding and signaling theory by providing new insights into signaling effectiveness. It highlights the overlooked impact of negative signals, reveals how incentive and financial signals interact, and introduces post-investment engagement as a novel measure of investor behavior, offering a dynamic view of crowdfunding performance.",

          "authors": "Sheng Shu, Jiangzhe Wang, Zhiqing Chen",
          "abstract": "Purpose Multichannel retailing efforts may have a dark side. This research provides novel insights into the dark side of multichannel retailing by investigating negative cross-channel cognitive overload outcomes within an SSO framework. Design/methodology/approach The proposed model is empirically validated by surveying 536 respondents and data was analyzed with PLS-SEM. Findings This study finds that multichannel customers may experience cross-channel cognitive overload, in the form of cross-channel information overload and cross-channel interaction overload, both of which are adversely related to purchase intention and omnichannel service use. Cognitive trust and emotional exhaustion mediate the detrimental effects of cross-channel cognitive load on consumers' purchase intentions and omnichannel service use. Consumers' high need for cognition can attenuate the relationship between cross-channel cognitive overload and emotional exhaustion, but not between cross-channel cognitive overload and cognitive trust. Practical implications Retailers should implement lifecycle-based multichannel strategies that address evolving cognitive overload patterns, from initial confusion to experienced-user fatigue. Essential tactics include centralizing product information management, personalizing content based on consumers' cognitive preferences, and developing cognitive accessibility features. Retailers should prioritize seamless navigation for new users and consistency for experienced shoppers, while offering educational resources to enhance multichannel literacy and tailored interfaces that match individual cognitive processing styles. Originality/value Unlike previous research that has predominantly focused on the bright side of multichannel retailing, this study provides a novel perspective on the dark side by exploring whether and how cross-channel cognitive overload affects consumer behaviors in multichannel retailing.",

          "authors": "Shuai Chen, Zhengyao Dai, Wenjun Chen, Xingwu Luo, Shuyue Zhang, Kai Sun",
          "abstract": "Purpose In the gig economy, online ride-hailing drivers experience occupational stigma perception (OSP), which may surpass that experienced by traditional service providers and significantly affect their service performance. However, how these drivers counteract OSP in the new online labor relationship has not been well studied. To address this issue, this paper presents an analysis of the moderating roles of online ride-hailing drivers' internal locus of control over work (iLOC) and customers' positive feedback on the basis of the conservation of resources theory. Design/methodology/approach To test our hypotheses, this paper conducted a field questionnaire survey in a Chinese city, collecting data from online ride-hailing drivers across various platforms. Findings The results reveal that online ride-hailing drivers' OSP negatively impacts their service performance and that both drivers' iLOC and customers' positive feedback mitigate this adverse effect. Moreover, the moderating effect of customers' positive feedback is mediated by drivers' iLOC, confirming the presence of a mediated moderation effect. Practical implications By focusing on the roles of the public, online ride-hailing platforms, and online ride-hailing drivers themselves, this study provides actionable and comprehensive insights into how to mitigate online ride-hailing drivers' OSP in the gig economy. Originality/value Previous studies have identified online ride-hailing drivers' iLOC as a stable moderator in the relationship between OSP and service performance. However, this paper empirically demonstrates that customers' positive feedback can induce changes in the iLOC, which subsequently moderates the relationship between OSP and service performance.",

          "authors": "Tiange Li, Chubing Zhang, Ying Chang",
          "abstract": "Purpose Large language models, such as ChatGPT, have made chatbot responses seem more natural, making it more difficult for customers to distinguish that chatbots are non-human. Although chatbots offer advantages in the service industry, their technical limitations can lead to service failures. This study aims to explore how the disclosure of the chatbot's identity during the initial stage of service, before any service failure occurs, affects customer tolerance of service failures. Design/methodology/approach Three psychological experiments were conducted to assess the effects of chatbot identity disclosure on customer tolerance of service failure. Findings This study confirms that the disclosure of the chatbots' identity at the initial stage of service, before any service failure occurs, has a positive impact on consumers' tolerance of service failures. Compared to non-identity disclosure, chatbot identity disclosure increases consumers' perception of chatbots' sincerity and reduces their disgust, thus increasing the consumers' tolerance of chatbot service failures. In addition, the explanation of service failures moderates the relationship between chatbot identity disclosure and customers' feelings of disgust and perceived sincerity. Practical implications This study reveals the importance of chatbot identity disclosure for service companies. Managers should consider a chatbot's ability to handle service failures when deciding whether to disclose its identity. Originality/value This research contributes to the literature on the positive effects of identity disclosure by investigating how the disclosure of a chatbot's identity during the initial stage of service, prior to any service failure, affects consumers' tolerance of service failures.",

          "abstract": "In response to hate speech, members of minorities use reclaimed derogatory language. Until now, psychological research has treated reclamation as a uniform concept in terms of the motivations of minorities, despite theoretical perspectives suggesting otherwise. In this paper, based on previous research, we described three motivations for using reclaimed language: to regain control, for humorous purposes, and to consolidate relationships in the community. We reported the process of creating a new scale to measure these three motivations. The three-dimensional structure of the Motivation for Language Reclamation Scale (MLRS) was validated in two studies ( N = 362; N = 141) among gay people in Poland. We also showed that the motivations have various implications for collective action intentions. Language reclamation for humorous purposes was associated with lower willingness to engage in collective action. By contrast, reclamation aimed at consolidating relationships was associated with higher willingness to engage in collective action.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated dehumanization of one’s intimate partner and alcohol consumption as predictors of intimate partner aggression (IPA). We integrated theories of dehumanization, alcohol, and intimate partner violence to examine relational-level influences on perpetration of IPA, and conducted an initial test of a novel framework explaining IPA risk in a large college sample of coupled individuals. We robustly assessed partner dehumanization (i.e., mechanistic and animalistic dehumanization, dehumanizing deindividuation, and sexual objectification), alcohol consumption quantity and frequency, the likelihood of enacting physical and psychological IPA as well as the amount of IPA when it was enacted, and a range of other risk factors for IPA. Results revealed that a comprehensive latent variable of dehumanization and alcohol use were additive risk factors for physical abuse, and at least moderate levels of drinking (i.e., 3-4 drinks per typical drinking day) might be necessary for dehumanization to escalate into physical IPA. In contrast, psychological IPA was directly predicted by dehumanization alone, at all levels of alcohol use. These findings held while controlling other established risk factors for IPA including global relationship discord. The results underscore the potential for early interventions that target dehumanizing and objectifying perceptions of intimate partners and drinking behaviors. Building on these preliminary findings, future research should further examine these dynamics in more diverse populations, using longitudinal and/or experimental designs to infer causality.",

          "abstract": "Despite the role friendship can play in the physical and mental health of adults, little is known about its relationship with suicidality. To address this gap, we conducted a scoping review on adult friendship and suicidality in Medline, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane Library from inception to April 9, 2024. We used a combination of keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms to find studies reporting on the themes of suicidality and adult friendship. We summarized key findings on the association between friendship and suicidality. We identified only 43 studies on adult friendship and suicidality. The study designs, goals, measurements, and populations were highly heterogeneous, and friendship was not measured consistently. Nevertheless, most studies (60.5% or 26 out of 43 unique studies) found friendship was protective against suicidality. This review highlights the inconsistent measurement of friendship and lack of conceptualization of friendship. Yet, friendship appears to be protective against suicidality. Further study is needed to understand the relationship between friendship and suicide.",

          "abstract": "As a significant algorithmic actor in a media system where humans and machines interact to produce and disseminate news information, Google acts as an external algorithmic editor to news media, shaping what information gets picked up for broader consumption. Journalists, in their attempt to inform and create a dialogue with the public, are constantly aware of Google’s dominance and, for the last two decades, have experienced the shifting power dynamics in the digitized media system. Based on 18 interviews with US-based journalists across a range of newsroom types and regions, this interview study shows how reporters and editors deal with this new external algorithmic editor. The findings demonstrate that they do that through resistance, relinquishment, and renegotiation. Journalists first resist giving up on their editorial values, setting particular limits around framing and selecting which hard news stories to cover, even when facing algorithmic pressure towards provocative and eye-grabbing content. Second, they relinquish some editorial control and create segregated content (“search work”) tailored to the algorithm and toward audience growth. Third, they renegotiate their values and roles to fit a new logic in which newsworthiness and commercial values overlap. These findings confirm and build upon previous work delineating how journalists navigate their 20th-century values with 21st-century digital curation in a hybrid media system shaped by both human and machine logics.",

          "authors": "Christian Schwaderer",
          "abstract": "Public sentiment toward government communicators plays a critical role during crises, influencing societal resilience and potentially contributing to broader trust in government. Such sentiment is shaped not only by what is said, but also by who says it. While existing literature on political crisis communication has largely focused on the content of governmental messages, it has overlooked the importance of the messenger. This study addresses that gap by shifting attention from what is communicated to who is communicating. This research explores how the personal characteristics of government communicators relate to public sentiment toward them during crises. To do so, this study matches data on communicators present at government-held press conferences with social media discourse, examining how these communicators are referenced online. Social media platforms serve as vital spaces where citizens communicate about their government’s crisis response and thus play an important role in building or undermining public responses. Given their role in shaping public perceptions of government performance, these digital platforms offer an ideal setting to observe sentiment toward communicators during crises. The study analyzes 744,000 posts on Twitter (now X) from six European countries during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic using advanced transformer-based classification models. Expressions of positive sentiment are identified through sentiment analysis, capturing affective reactions in user-generated content. The findings indicate that political actors are generally associated with less positive sentiment than experts, who tend to elicit more positive responses. Gender also emerges as a significant factor: During peak crisis periods, women communicators are more likely to be referenced positively on social media. This pattern aligns with prior research on a potential “trust advantage” for women in crisis communication, which has been linked to relational communication traits that are particularly valued in high-stress contexts.",

The study comes at a time when diverse regulatory frameworks are emerging globally to govern influencers’ activity, mandating transparency in sponsorships, protecting consumer interests, and setting boundaries on influencer involvement in governmental and political campaigns. The methodology combines two main steps: (a) a web search of news articles and blogs to identify relevant examples of government–influencer collaborations; (b) a manual annotation of government-led influencer strategies of the retrieved examples based on thematic areas, degree of autonomy in the partnership, and narrative strategy. The study focuses on France, the US, and Canada, chosen for their advanced digital environments and initiative-taking approaches in both social media regulation and public diplomacy. The main contribution of the study is to develop a typology of government–influencer collaborations to align public perception with (inter)national policy goals and reach their target audiences.",

          "authors": "Mauro Bomba",
          "abstract": "TikTok’s rapid rise in media and information consumption among young Italians has recently prompted Italian politicians to stake out this space during election campaigns to engage a younger electorate, traditionally sidelined by mainstream news and political communication. However, attempts to tailor Italian political communication to the TikTok ecosystem are still undergoing a process of adaptation and familiarization (Boccia Artieri &amp;amp; Donato, 2024). This may reflect the challenges of engaging with TikTok’s peculiarities: it is driven by youth-centered usage and language focused on entertainment and escapism (Cervi et al., 2023), and its predominantly algorithmic architecture shifts content circulation from relational networks to personalized recommendations. This configuration transforms the political experience on social media for both politicians and users, moving from relational interactivity toward a more aesthetic, performative dimension. In this context, our study examines how these TikTok characteristics affect the production, circulation, exposure, and evaluation of political content during the 2024 European Parliament election campaign. The analysis revolves around three main foci: How politicians used TikTok and leveraged the platform’s features; how users encountered and assessed political content; and how the topics addressed by politicians on TikTok compare with those young Italians deem most important. The second-order election setting of the European elections (Reif &amp;amp; Schmitt, 1980), contrasted with youth voter appeal (Consiglio Nazionale dei Giovani, 2024), adds complexity, making the alignment of political and user interests a key driver of TikTok content circulation less predictable.",

Everyday life studies that take into account care home residents’ knowledge, values, and experiences are few and far between. This research engages care home residents in dialogue to co-produce understanding about their lived experiences with mobile technologies. Drawing on qualitative research with 39 care home residents at long-term care sites in Canada, the paper calls for reframing digital inequalities in terms of relational digital agency. The analysis describes how meaningful communication environments in long-term care involve a wide range of factors, including effective access to analogue media and wider support networks, which enable residents to put meaningful limits on their uses of mobile devices. Moreover, the findings show how having the opportunity to deny and contest mobile technologies can be an important part of feeling socially and digitally included, which brings question to existing measures of digital inclusion that focus on quantity and quality of technology use. Whereas most research on digital agency has concerned youth, this paper develops an understanding of relational digital agency to account for long-term care residents’ experiences negotiating and adapting to digital change.",

          "abstract": "This mixed-methods study combines experience sampling and smartphone log data to explore momentary associations between passively sensed smartphone use, feeling rushed, and perceived task juggling in daily life. Using data from 774 adults, we analyze how four use features (frequency, duration, fragmentation, and notifications received) of four mobile app categories (email, social media, chat, and work communication) affect how rushed people feel, both directly and indirectly by increasing their perceived juggling load. At the between-person level, persons who use work communication apps more frequently and longer, and who receive more chat notifications, also felt more rushed on average. Findings also revealed within-person associations in the theorized direction (e.g., increased email frequency predicting increased task load and feelings of being rushed) for nearly all features of three out of four examined app categories, with social media use features as a noticeable exception. Perceived task juggling mediated these associations, suggesting that the examined smartphone use features contribute to feeling rushed by increasing the (real or perceived) load of tasks that people juggle within and across role domains. Some patterns differed based on age, gender, parenthood, and segmentation preference.

          "abstract": "Social media influencers (SMIs) develop unique relationships with their followers, including high levels of trust and credibility. This study examined how these influencer–follower relationships affect news media trust with a focus on actual self-congruence, ideal self-congruence, parasocial interaction (PSI), and source and message credibility. Data showed that respectively, positive correlations exist between each of these variables and news media trust. However, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression only showed direct effects of actual self-congruence and PSI on trust, while message credibility had a negative effect. Structural equation modeling showed that actual self-congruence positively mediated the relationship between PSI and trust. Overall, consuming SMI-based news and information increased news media trust among followers, suggesting that SMIs play a complimentary rather than a disruptive role regarding news media trust.",

          "abstract": "People increasingly live within and across physical and digital spaces, forming idiosyncratic connections with those locales. Building on extant work indicating cross-materiality Sense of Place (SoP) to be a function of symbolism, purpose, identity, relationality, and emotion (SPIRE), the current study tested the validity of a five-factor SPIRE measure and examined variance as a function of physical (vs. digital) and positive (vs. negative) places. Among cross-national participants (N = 348 from &gt; 30 countries), response patterns forward a two-factor solution: One combines SPIR elements anchored to identity items representing an egocentric orientation toward the place (55% of variance explained), and another comprises only emotion items representing idiosyncratic emotion dynamics (14%). Validation analyses found egocentricity to be strongly and positively associated with metaphorical conceptualizations of SoP, emotionality less so, differentially across place materiality and valence. Findings hold implications for digital and physical space design, especially as generative technologies increasingly afford place personalization.",

          "abstract": "This article studies the negotiation of humanness in artificial sociality by examining the cyborg case of humanlike virtual influencers and their performance of authenticity, drawing on phenomenological ethnographic research. Based on the findings, I propose the framework of “meta-authenticity”—the flexible, co-constructive process of self-referential (in)authenticity performances. Virtual influencers’ meta-authenticity was a dynamic outcome of collaborative performances by entangled human and nonhuman actors. Meta-authenticity’s theoretical and practical contributions are demonstrated, including through an illustrative application. Then, I reflect on meta-authenticity’s implications on human cultures, such as regarding artificial sociality’s capacities to provide authentic interaction on and as per demand, followed by suggestions for ethical practices. As an accountability-integrated framework, meta-authenticity encourages nuanced critical assessments of artificial sociality’s “real” actors and consequences.",

          "abstract": "Developed by a Korean start-up called ScatterLab, Luda Lee is an AI-powered social chatbot designed to embody the persona of a 20-year-old, youthful college girl and promoted as “your first AI friend.” A year after the suspension of Luda 1.0 in 2021 amid a heated controversy surrounding Luda 1.0 in 2021 regarding user-initiated abuse and the unethical sourcing of language data, ScatterLab recently reintroduced a generative AI-powered Luda 2.0 to the public, while pursuing the expansion of its operation as a software-as-a-service provider. The article traces the evolution of both Luda and ScatterLab, highlighting the crucial role of user engagement in the making and repurposing of the company’s “proprietary dataset.” It explores how user engagement is not only an objective but also a strategy for corporate growth in the artificial sociality enterprise. Strategies to encourage user engagement, like gendering of the chatbot design, create unanticipated kinds of user engagements and user-generated data. Those data, conceived as materials from which the AI’s competence is absorbed, is constructed as an asset, a material and discursive anchor for the company’s future promises.",

          "abstract": "Drawing on the “Voigt-Kampff Empathy Test”—a science fiction version of Turing’s famous thought experiment—we propose the Conversational Action Test (CAT): a new approach to evaluating conversational artificial intelligence (AI) voice agents. We compare social actions in a range of telephone service encounters where one party is an artificial conversational agent to a range of similar human-human calls. The CAT demonstrates a novel paradigm that addresses long-standing theoretical and methodological problems for ostensible “tests” of conversational AI by (a) revealing the conceptual confusion of attempting to “detect” an AI in routine service interactions and (b) focusing, instead, on the situated interactional practices through which an AI “passes” for human. We discuss the implications of the CAT for the design and evaluation of conversational AI, and for the notion of “humanness” as a goal or benchmark for such systems. Data include publicly available human/AI service calls and comparable human-human calls in British and American English.",

          "abstract": "Disability is a complex topic, despite 1 in 4 Americans having some kind of disability. Social media form a powerful tool for the social inclusion of people with disabilities, allowing them to seek and share information. Self-representation is a part of this dynamic, revolving around conscious creative choices and curated self-expression within a mediatized habitat. The current study examined disability influencers on social media to understand their self-representation strategies and the discourse they use to communicate about disability. Content from disability influencers ( N = 14) was textually and visually analyzed for self-representation strategies, and comparison of the medical and social models of disability was made. Findings revealed these models are not always in opposition. Disability was found to be a complex topic, especially in light of visible and invisible representation with influencers positioning themselves in relation to larger societal structures, social media affordances, and disability discourses.",

However, we still know very little about the emerging communicative dynamics facilitated by these technologies. This special issue tackles a dimension of AI that is becoming increasingly relevant and ubiquitous: artificial sociality, defined as technologies and practices that construct the appearance of social behavior in machines. The notion of artificial sociality aims to emphasize that machines construct only an illusion or artifice of sociality, stimulating the humans who interact with them to project social frames and meanings. In this introduction to the themed issue, we discuss the dynamics and implications of artificial sociality and show how these technologies are increasingly incorporated and normalized within digital platforms. The issue includes contributions that offer empirical findings and theoretical insights by examining a broad array of AI technologies, ranging from ChatGPT to Replika.",

As an example, we use the case of Replika, a popular but controversial social chatbot designed to serve as companions, friends, and even romantic partners for millions of people. In 2023, Replika underwent a series of major fixes and algorithmic updates leading to significant changes in how it responds to users. Through analyzing posts from a popular Reddit community dedicated to Replika, we showcase that users developed various re-domestication strategies to come to terms with these changes. Our study illustrates that Replika should be understood as a quasi-domesticated object that constantly requires users to find new ways to re-integrate it into their lives. We conclude the paper by highlighting how our findings can inform communication research.",

          "abstract": "This study examines influencer Andrew Tate’s social media content as embodying virtual manhood acts (VMA)—technologically facilitated misogyny in online spaces. Through content analysis of 13 Tate videos from 2022, we demonstrate how his performances of masculinity extend beyond reinforcing gender binaries to potentially facilitating gender radicalization leading to misogynistic, homophobic, and transphobic attitudes and behaviors. Applying McCauley and Moskalenko’s radicalization framework, we map Tate’s content to pathways at macro (jujitsu politics, hatred, martyrdom), group (polarization, isolation, competition), and individual levels (personal and group grievance, slippery slope, love, risk and status, unfreezing). Our findings suggest that the combination of VMA and digital platforms creates fertile conditions for gender-based radicalization, particularly for members of the social media manosphere. Tate’s extensive influence, amplified by algorithms, represents a concerning escalation in the potential for widespread gender radicalization with real-world implications.",

          "abstract": "This article examines false online job ads and user susceptibility by drawing on three research areas: automated deception detection, cognitive bias (Dunning–Kruger effect), and digital and algorithmic literacy. Leveraging a data set of 17,879 ads, we develop machine learning models to distinguish false from legitimate ads and survey a representative US sample ( N = 635) to assess user susceptibility. Results show that ad veracity is predicted by visual (e.g. company logo) and linguistic cues (e.g. “team,” ‘we’) that signal credibility. Survey findings indicate a strong Dunning–Kruger effect: overconfident individuals were less accurate in detecting false ads, perceived them as more credible, and were more likely to share them. Literacy effects were complex: while general Internet skills improved detection accuracy, algorithmic literacy had more nuanced influences on ad perceptions. These results highlight the psychological mechanisms that contribute to the spread of false information in digital communication, deepening our understanding of online deception.",

For this reason, GenAI tools that attempt to replicate human responses have heightened potential to misinform and deceive people. This article examines how three GenAI tools, within divergent contexts, mimic credible emotional responsiveness: OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the National Eating Disorder Association’s Tessa and Luka’s Replika. The analysis uses Hochschild’s concept of feeling rules to explore how these tools exploit, reinforce or violate people’s internalised social guidelines around appropriate and credible emotional expression. We also examine how GenAI developers’ own beliefs and intentions can create potential social harms and conflict with users. Results show that while GenAI tools enact compliance with basic feeling rules – for example, apologising when an error is noticed – this ability alone may not sustain user interest, particularly once the tools’ inability to generate meaningful, accurate information becomes intolerable.",

To understand users’ attitudes and behavior, we conducted a digital ethnography on a pioneer online community related to Replika, through the lens of immaterial labor and AI imaginary. Our analysis revealed that Replika users invest a significant amount of intellectual and affective resources into the chatbot through algorithm training, driven by fascinating imaginaries of an ideal AI partner. Moreover, users’ perceptions of Replika’s ventriloquism mechanism – where Replika serves as both the chatbot partner and the intermediary between users and the company – helps to facilitate and obscure the exploitation of users’ intimacies and immaterial labor.

Inspired by Bourdieu’s work on cultural stratification and distinction, this work sheds light on the sociocultural roots of artificial sociality, and on how these become manifest as ‘habitus’ within the outputs of generative AI models. We conducted 39 interviews with three AI chatbots – ChatGPT, Gemini and Replika – after asking them to impersonate individuals with different occupational positions: highly skilled professionals, blue-collar workers, university professors in the humanities, construction workers, computer scientists and hairdressers. Our qualitative study shows class-based regularities in how popular AI chatbots represent the lifestyle and tastes of fictional personas in artificial conversations, partly mediated by infrastructural and design elements.

Individuals with high deference to scientific authority judged power-oriented authorities more favorably and drew less on benevolence and integrity dimensions than did those low in deference.

          "authors": "Claire Roney, Daniel Wiesner, Andreas A. Riedl, Jakob-Moritz Eberl",
          "abstract": "This study examines how the evolving conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic shaped audience expectations of journalism in Austria. Traditionally defined by roles such as Informer and Watchdog , journalists adapted to new roles during the crisis, including Collaborator with health officials, Science Communicator , and Fact-Checker . Drawing on data from three waves of the Austrian Corona Panel Project with approximately 1,500 participants per wave, we analyze audience expectations of nine journalistic roles. Our findings show strong support for emerging roles like the Fact Checker and Science Communicator , highlighting the demand for accurate information and scientific clarity. However, audience expectations fluctuated significantly over time, reflecting shifts in public trust and the diminishing rally-around-the-flag effect. These results underscore the volatility and context-dependency of audience demands during crises, emphasizing the need for journalism to remain adaptable in rapidly changing environments.",

          "authors": "Franz Reiter, Uta Russmann",
          "abstract": "Most research studying the content of political campaigns has employed cross-sectional, cross-national, or longitudinal designs. Although this research has enhanced our understanding of campaigns, there is still a lack of cross-level studies that compare the content of campaigns at different political levels. In this study, we employ a cross-level design by comparing campaign strategies in the 2024 European Parliament (EP) election and the 2024 National Parliament (NP) election in Austria. We focus on campaign strategies related to dissonant public spheres: Populist content, negative campaigning, and the polarizing issues of immigration and environmental policy. To do so, we apply a quantitative content analysis ( N = 1,794) of the Facebook posts of political parties and candidates during both campaigns. Using binary logistic regression, we find that negative campaigning is significantly more likely and the issue of environmental policy is significantly less likely to occur in the NP campaign compared to the EP campaign. However, there are no significant differences between the EP and NP campaigns regarding populist content and the issue of immigration. Our findings demonstrate that the second-order elections theory may be less applicable to the analysis of digital campaign strategies. Instead, other frameworks—such as populist discourse as a global phenomenon, the transnationalization of issues like immigration, and the increasing salience of global concerns such as climate change—may offer more analytical traction.",

          "authors": "Aqsa Farooq, Elske van den Hoogen, Marina Tulin, Claes de Vreese",
          "abstract": "The 2024 European Parliament (EP) elections (EP24) were regarded as a “testing ground” for artificial intelligence (AI)-powered disinformation threats. Instances of multimodal, AI-generated disinformation were found across European democracies, leading to questions about just how prevalent this threat may be in the eyes of citizens poised to vote in the EP elections, and its influence on electoral processes. Utilizing a three-wave panel approach, we surveyed a sample of citizens in the Netherlands, Germany, and Poland ( N = 2929) to track changes over the course of the election cycle. We explored the association between citizens’ concerns about and perceived encounters with AI-generated content, including disinformation. We were also interested in how these concerns and perceived encounters differ over the course of the campaign, differ by country, and ultimately, how they relate to citizens’ perceptions of the fairness of the electoral process. We found that increased reported exposure to AI-generated election content, including disinformation, is associated with heightened concern about AI’s threat to democratic integrity in the EP24. While reported exposure to AI-generated content positively influenced perceptions of electoral integrity and democratic satisfaction at the EU-level, disinformation eroded these perceptions, albeit modestly. Reported exposure to AI-generated disinformation peaked just before elections, suggesting strategic timing. Understanding citizens’ perspectives can be crucial for the development of a robust, democratic and resilient information ecosystem—particularly during elections.",

          "authors": "Kelechi Amakoh",
          "abstract": "Negative campaigning is an age-old strategy, yet its impact on trust in election outcomes remains underexplored, particularly in newer democracies. In this study, I argue that negative campaign messages erode electoral trust by fostering cynicism, undermining confidence in politicians, and heightening the perceived stakes of elections. By signalling that candidates will do whatever it takes to win, such messages raise concerns about fraud and diminish institutional trust. I further contend that these effects depend on the autonomy of electoral management bodies (EMBs). When EMB autonomy is low, greater exposure to negative campaigning significantly increases perceptions that elections are unfair. By contrast, where EMBs are highly autonomous, negative campaigning does not reduce trust in electoral integrity and may even bolster it, as institutional safeguards reassure voters. To test these claims, I draw on Afrobarometer survey data from eighteen countries across three rounds, expert assessments of negative campaign coverage from the Negative Campaigning Comparative Expert Survey, and measures of EMB autonomy from Varieties of Democracy. My findings show that the interaction between media negativity and EMB independence shapes public trust in elections, underscoring the central role of electoral institutions in mediating the democratic consequences of campaign strategies.",

          "authors": "Phoebe Maares, Kim Löhmann, Folker Hanusch, Daniel Nölleke",
          "abstract": "As an institution, journalism relies on several key normative values to claim authority and legitimacy— autonomy, objectivity , and transparency . Although these concepts have been widely studied, most research employs quantitative approaches or focuses on specific beats, often political journalism. Drawing on fifty-five in-depth interviews with Austrian journalists, we examine the meaning of these journalistic values and their relevance in political, lifestyle, sports, and economic journalism. We find that autonomy is universally valued, though commercial influences and pressures are more frequently noted in lifestyle and sports journalism. Objectivity is emphasized in political and economic journalism but less prioritized in “softer” news beats, where subjective perspectives are more widely accepted. Transparency is important across all fields, yet differences emerge between “hard” and “soft” news regarding the necessity to disclose sources or funding agencies. Thus, universality across beats cannot be assumed, and the heterogeneity of the journalistic field, in terms of its application of different normative values, needs to be considered in future studies.",

          "authors": "Nicholas Vanderschantz, Nicola Daly, Vouchleang San",
          "abstract": "With the establishment of Māori medium education in the 1980s, picturebooks featuring Te Reo Māori have been needed and are increasingly being developed, produced, and used in full immersion and mainstream education in Aotearoa New Zealand. In recent years, the number of bilingual picturebooks featuring Te Reo Māori and English has increased. Improved access to bilingual picturebooks in a society that includes both an Indigenous and colonial language as two of its three official languages is vital to support the status of Te Reo Māori as an official language and to support English speakers learning Te Reo Māori. Studies by Daly ( Dual-Language Picturebooks in Māori and English , 2016, and The Linguistic Landscape of English–Spanish Dual-Language Picturebooks , 2017) have explored the layout of such bilingual picturebooks, suggesting that the order of languages reflects the linguistic hierarchy or relative status of the two languages. Yet, to date, no empirical studies have investigated how designers’ typographic order choices affect readers’ perceptions of the status of languages. In this article, we present the findings from a mixed-methods study of 50 readers’ perceptions of typographic and linguistic hierarchy in pages of bilingual picturebooks when the order of languages was a variable. Results show that order did affect the opinions of readers, and this effect varied depending on the linguistic repertoire of the participants.",

          "authors": "TJ Thomson",
          "abstract": "To the general public, text-to-image generators, such as Midjourney and DALL-E, seem to work through magic and, indeed, their inner workings are often frustratingly opaque. This is, in part, due to the lack of transparency from big tech companies around aspects like training data and how the algorithms powering their generators work, on the one hand, and the deep and technical knowledge in computer science and machine learning, on the other, that is required to understand these workings. Acknowledging these aspects, this qualitative examination seeks to better understand the black box of algorithmic vision through asking a large language model to first describe two sets of visually distinct journalistic images. The resulting descriptions are then fed into the same large language model to see how the AI tool remediates these images. In doing so, this study evaluates how machines process images in each set and which specific visual style elements across three dimensions (representational, aesthetic and technical) machine vision regards as important for the description, and which it does not. Taken together, this exploration helps scholars understand more about how computers process, describe and render images, including the attributes that they focus on and tend to ignore when doing so.",
