          "authors": "Johan Jansson, Claes Thorén",
          "abstract": "Modern society is characterized by technological and social acceleration. Digital devices and technologies have been integrated into nearly every aspect of our lives, from the public to the personal, transforming the material, social and mental worlds at an accelerating rate. To deal with the feeling of acceleration, carefully limiting the number of choices and features in the digital devices we use every day is central in order to facilitate and sustain creativity and focus. Under the umbrella term of post-digital artifacts, there are today several examples of ‘alternative’ products that offer limited functionality as a feature – and they seem to be growing in popularity. Using a qualitative analysis of online texts surrounding a selection of post-digital artifacts: two mobile phones (the Light Phone and the Punkt), a writing tablet (reMarkable), and a writing tool (Freewrite), the aim of this article is to understand the emergence of these post-digital artifacts and what the emergence says about a contemporary post-digital condition. The analysis results in an analytical framework identifying trajectories of opposing conceptual pairs of the digital and the post-digital. In addition, the article applies Rosa’s concept of ‘alienation’ and ‘resonance’ in order to further understand how and why these artifacts play a role in creating meaning and resonance in a digital society characterized by acceleration. Arguably, resonance (or a lack thereof) emerges as the key currency around what is at stake in the post-digital condition. Reclaiming control over knowledge, activities, spatiality and temporality emerges as essential to understanding what resonance means and what the case products produce.",

          "authors": "Lewis Tennant",
          "abstract": "This article presents a detailed overview of podcast production in New Zealand. This is the first broad survey of podcasting in New Zealand, and seemingly the first of its kind globally. It tracks the development and growth of podcasting in New Zealand from a medium pioneered by independent producers to a growing sector of the local media market. Drawing from the New Zealand Podcast Directory – an extensive database of podcasts produced from 2005 onwards – this article categorises and assesses the 722 podcasts listed, before more broadly discussing key characteristics of New Zealand’s podcast sphere. The titles are coded across 12 categories, providing just under 10,000 data points for analysis. Producer typologies are discussed, before the publishing status of shows is explored. The number, length, and frequency of episodes are surveyed, followed by a breakdown of podcasts by format. Podcast subject matter is then considered, before the global reach of New Zealand’s most successful podcasts is evaluated. Undertaking this research project revealed inconsistencies with podcast terminology and issues with conventional podcast categories. There is no ubiquitous list of podcast formats, and accompanying definitions of each. When discussing podcasts, genre and topic are often used interchangeably. Aside from True Crime, podcast genres in the main lack definition. Conventional podcast categories lack the specificity needed to adequately identify many shows. Consequently, this article presents and tests a new podcast classification system designed to provide greater flexibility and specificity.",

          "authors": "Alessandro Caliandro",
          "abstract": "In this article, I introduce a novel epistemological approach meant to re-adapt the digital methods paradigm to a fast changing digital landscape. This change was mostly brought about by the transformation of Web 2.0 into a platformized social media environment and the advent of the post-API and platform surveillance era. This approach is premised on the idea of considering the Internet user as a source of methods, rather than an object of study. To this purpose I suggest to ‘ follow the user’, meaning to take advantage of the natively digital methods that Internet users employ to gather, organise, manage and create their own digital data throughout their everyday digital practices. In order to illustrate my approach, I show how to practically follow the users in each of the key phases of a digital research project within social media platforms: keywords selection, data collection, data sampling, data analysis. In doing so, I mean to contribute to an emerging strand of research within the digital methods tradition which is trying to: (a) update digital methods, given the continuous mutations of the digital landscape; (b) seek a more organic and systematic integration of digital and qualitative methods; (c) go beyond the classical quali-quanti dichotomy.",

          "authors": "Marta Dynel",
          "abstract": "This paper contributes to the nascent research on Internet memes examined as items of (de)legitimising discourse, its empirical focus being memes addressing NFTs (non-fungible tokens). The mystifying NFT trade became hype in 2021, attracting massive media coverage and stimulating heated discussion across social media, which includes memetic content production. This study explores the multimodal discourses of (de)legitimisation in NFT memes. Based on a dataset of relevant 993 memes extracted manually from an automatically generated corpus of 1628 Twitter memes, a deductive-inductive multimodal analysis proves the original dichotomy (underlying the polarised views expressed through memes) insufficient. Seven memetic patterns dictated by (de)legitimisation stances are identified. In addition to NFT-legitimising and NFT-delegitimising categories, ambiguous equipotential (de)legitimisation memes, two categories of memes with blended (de)legitimising stances and two categories of elusive-stance memes are distinguished. The notion of ‘quasi-legitimisation’ is proposed to capture the memetic categories that normalise the thorny concept of NFTs.",

          "abstract": "This study analyses the elements involved in adapting a video game or video game saga into a film or series, aiming to propose a model of film adaptation by identifying independent intertextual and intermedial variables. A review of specialized literature in game studies, cinematography, intertextuality, intermediality, and adaptation was conducted. Independent variables were extracted and used to analyze the series adaptation of the Fallout saga. The results are discussed in relation to theoretical precepts from the literature. The findings allow for the proposal of a cinematic adaptation model that interprets different narrative and digital levels of video games. Key elements include the narrative base, construction of an independent story, addition, omission, intermedial translation, suppression, and manageable complexity.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Evolving business landscapes have highlighted the crucial role of innovative digital transformation strategies (DTSs) in reimagining organisational operations and responses to optimise performance, regardless of organisational size or employee composition. The study suggests that DTS is a process that occurs continuously, rather than being a one-time event. It also underscores the critical role of personal resilience and organisational support in achieving job performance goals. Design/methodology/approach Using a survey analysis, this study examines the impact of organisational response and agility, as fundamental components of DTS, on employees' job performance. In addition, it investigates how boundary conditions of personal resilience and organisational support moderates the relationship between (1) organisational agility and job performance, and (2) organisational response and job performance. Findings The research findings demonstrate the impact of DTS on job performance. It highlights the mediating roles of organisational support and agility in improving employees' performance. The study also discusses the critical role of personal resilience and organisational support in navigating the insightful impacts of organisational agility and organisational response on the job performance. Originality/value This paper presents a theoretical framework that integrates the dynamic capabilities of employees and organisations, providing academics and practitioners with a comprehensive perspective on the growth of employees' dynamic capabilities. By offering insightful discussions, the study highlights that, while creating new DTS, organisations not only improve their dynamic capabilities but also enhances the people’s dynamic capabilities and make them more resilient.",

          "authors": "Aihui Chen, Anran Lyu, Yaobin Lu",
          "abstract": "Purpose As human–AI hybrid teams become more common, it is essential for team members to interact effectively with artificial intelligence (AI) to complete tasks successfully. The integration of AI into the team environment alters the cooperative dynamics, prompting inquiry into how the design characteristics of AI impact the working mode and individual performance. Despite the significance of this issue, the effects of AI design on team dynamics and individual performance have yet to be fully explored. Design/methodology/approach Drawing upon coping theory, this study presents a research model aimed at elucidating how the characteristics of AI in human–AI interaction influence human members’ adaptive behavior, subsequently impacting individual performance. Through the creation of experiments that require human–AI collaboration to solve problems, we observe and measure various aspects of AI performance and human adaptation. Findings We observe that the explainability of AI enhances the behavioral adaptation of human team members, whereas the usability and intellectuality of AI improve their cognitive adaptation. Additionally, we find that human team members’ affective adaptation is negatively affected by the likability of AI. Our findings demonstrate that both behavioral and cognitive adaptations positively impact individual performance, whereas affective adaptation negatively impacts it. Practical implications Our research findings provide recommendations for building efficient human–AI hybrid teams and insights for the design and optimization of AI. Originality/value Overall, these results offer insights into the adaptive behavior of humans in human–AI interaction and provide recommendations for the establishment of effective human–AI hybrid teams. These findings pioneer an understanding of how design characteristics of AI impact team dynamics and individual performance, establishing a connection between AI attributes and human adaptive behavior.",

          "authors": "Ayoung Suh",
          "abstract": "Purpose In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the interest in the use of virtual reality (VR) for organizational collaboration has dramatically increased. However, empirical research on the optimal types of VR and avatar designs for effective collaboration remains limited. To address these gaps, this study investigates how VR types (immersive vs non-immersive) and avatar similarity (high vs low) impact collaboration performance, with a focus on the mediating roles of somatic, psychological and behavioral engagement. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on embodied cognition theory and grounded in user engagement theory, we developed a research model that delineates the factors influencing collaboration performance. This model was empirically tested with data collected from a laboratory experiment involving 195 participants, employing a 2 × 2 factorial design. The Engage VR was used for the experiment because it supports the same virtual environment for collaboration between immersive and non-immersive VR contexts. The data were analyzed at the team level ( n  = 65). Findings The results of this study reveal that both immersive VR and high avatar similarity significantly enhance collaboration performance by augmenting somatic engagement, which subsequently boosts psychological and behavioral engagement. Originality/value This research deepens the scholarly understanding of the intricate interplay among VR types, avatar design and user engagement. The study’s theoretical implications underscore the conceptualization of somatic engagement as a critical dimension of user engagement in virtual collaboration, enriching the extant literature on VR-based collaboration. It also provides pragmatic insights to enhance virtual collaboration in the workplace.",

          "title": "How does anthropomorphism promote consumer responses to social chatbots: mind perception perspective",
          "authors": "Baoku Li, Ruoxi Yao, Yafeng Nan",
          "abstract": "Purpose Benefiting from the development and innovation of artificial intelligence and affective computing technology, social chatbots that integrate cognitive analysis and affective social services have flooded into the consumer market. For cognition and emotion-oriented tasks, social chatbots do not always receive positive consumer responses. In addition, consumers have a contradictory attitude toward the anthropomorphism of chatbots. Therefore, from the perspective of mind perception and the two dimensions of social judgment, this research explores the mechanism of consumer responses to anthropomorphic interaction styles when social chatbots complete different service tasks. Design/methodology/approach This paper utilizes three behavior experimental designs and survey methods to collect data and the ANOVA, t -test and bootstrap analysis methods to verify the assumed hypotheses. Findings The results indicate that when the service task type of a social chatbot is cognition-oriented, compared to a warm anthropomorphic interaction style, a competent anthropomorphic interaction style can improve consumer responses more effectively. During this process, agent-mind perception plays a mediating role. When the service task type of a social chatbot is emotion-oriented, compared with a competent anthropomorphic conversation style, a warm anthropomorphic conversation style can improve consumer responses. Experience-mind perception mediates this influencing relationship. Originality/value The research results theoretically enrich the relevant research on the anthropomorphism of social chatbots and expand the application of the theory of mind perception in the fields of artificial intelligence and interactive marketing. Our findings provide theoretical guidance for the anthropomorphic development and design of social chatbots and the practical management of service task scenarios.",

          "authors": "Mahdi Mirhoseini, Pierre-Majorique Léger, Sylvain Sénécal",
          "abstract": "Purpose In the past decade, the use of neurophysiological measures as a complementary source of information has contributed to our understanding of human–computer interaction. However, less attention has been given to their capability in providing measures with high temporal resolution. Two studies are designed to address the challenge of measuring users’ cognitive load in an online shopping environment and investigate how it is related to task difficulty, task uncertainty and shopping convenience. Design/methodology/approach Two experiments using behavioral and neurophysiological measures are conducted to investigate how various types of the cognitive load construct can be measured and used in an online shopping context. Findings Results of the first study suggest that although all cognitive load measures are influenced by task difficulty, only accumulated load (i.e. total cognitive load experienced during a task) is sensitive to task uncertainty. Results of the second study show that convenience negatively influences accumulated load, and the latter negatively influences user satisfaction. Practical implications Our research offers practical value by providing designers with a validated method to measure users’ cognitive load, enabling the identification of usability issues and design improvement. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature by developing a rich and temporally high-resolution measurement of the cognitive load construct and examining how it can inform us about users’ cognitive state in an online shopping environment.",

          "abstract": "Despite the power and extensive applications of communication accommodation theory (CAT), it has yet to be linked to the most common of conversational activities, gossip. We examine both the ways in which gossip plays a role as a communicative adjustment and the influence of accommodative behaviors upon gossip. The latter are relevant to strategic uses of gossip to influence others’ reputations, particularly others regarded as sexual rivals. We consider how gossip can operate as a form of norm talk, reinforcing ingroup norms. Gossip is conceptually and colloquially close to rumor and we explore how manipulation of ambiguity between the two may operate as an accommodative move while attacking others. The penultimate section concerns gossip and rumor on the internet and the forms of accommodation that promote conspiracy theories and allow abuse and trolling. Finally, theoretical implications for CAT and future directions for research on gossip and rumor are proposed.",

          "abstract": "Positive attitudes toward regional/minority languages are an essential precondition to language maintenance/revitalization. We investigate implicit and explicit attitudes toward Welsh and English and their relationship with childhood and adolescent age exposure among adult Welsh speakers from northwest Wales. Results indicate that implicit and explicit attitude constructs diverge and therefore bear differentially on language maintenance/revitalization. Specifically, comparing speaker data from the Language and Social Background Questionnaire with results from two independent studies, employing the Attitudes towards Languages (AToL) Scale and an Implicit Association Task respectively, we show that the implicit measure reveals a positive correlation between attitudes and exposure in primary school age. Conversely, the AToL returned no statistically significant factors, suggesting differential sensitivity of the explicit and implicit measures. We argue that an understanding of both types of attitude constructs, and attending to exposure levels especially as they relate to intergenerational transmission, is necessary to implement an effective language maintenance/revitalization strategy.",

This study uses field theory to highlight the voices of this marginalized community, missing from the dialogue on journalistic practices.

Findings reveal that journalists are adopting pragmatic strategies to bring some equilibrium to the field amid Taliban pressures. The existing practices involve renegotiating journalistic approaches where certain aspects are modified and others totally abandoned due to authoritarian constraints. This evolution underscores the profession’s resilience and adaptability, diverging from Western ideals but essential for survival in these strict conditions.",

          "abstract": "This article discusses the development of task-based performance tests designed to measure digital skills among children aged between 12 and 17 years old. The tasks reflect authentic everyday situations to evaluate skill levels. The primary objective is to design performance tests that provide a comprehensive understanding of children’s digital skills. The tests cover three distinct skill dimensions: (a) information navigation and processing; (b) communication and interaction; and (c) content creation and production. These include several subdimensions, offering a detailed perspective on children’s digital skills. The development process itself revealed several methodological challenges that needed to be addressed, yielding valuable lessons for future applications. Key lessons from our cross-national experiences include the importance of involving children early in the design process, using a combination of open-ended and closed tasks, and allocating ample time to walk through the coding scheme.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the role of information and communication technology (ICT) skill development programs, such as the Digital Talent Scholarship and ICT Jamboree, in empowering people with disability across Indonesia. Grounded in empowerment theory, it investigates how these programs contribute to personal autonomy, economic engagement, and social inclusion. The research focuses on participants’ perceptions of the impact of ICT training on their independence and social integration. It also identifies challenges in applying ICT skills in daily life, including barriers to employment and limited access to assistive technologies like Braille displays and hearing aids. Through a qualitative approach—using semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with 99 participants from diverse people with disability groups—the findings reveal significant improvements in self-confidence, digital literacy, and participants’ ability to overcome employment and online communication challenges. While ICT shows potential to reduce social isolation and foster digital inclusion, disparities in proficiency and access to adaptive tools remain. The study emphasizes the need for more tailored interventions and advocates for increased funding, better accessibility, and stronger public-private partnerships to advance disability inclusion through ICT, extending beyond Indonesia to Asia and the Middle East.",

          "abstract": "After a significant surge of active fact-checking organisations over the past decade, fact-checkers now operate in more than 100 countries. Although the fact-checking movement is diverse, the majority of organisations function at a national level. However, some organisations operate on a sub-state scale, based either on community or geographic region. These fact-checkers investigate statements relevant to specific populations that might otherwise go unaddressed. In Europe, signatories of the International Fact-Checking Network are active in regions with federal or devolved power. This study brings a comparative analysis of regional fact-checkers in Europe, combining qualitative interviews with editors and managers of these organisations with complementary document analysis. Our findings highlight how organisational formats influence fact-checking motivations, the difference in scope between political fact-checking and debunking routines, and the collaborative relations regional fact-checkers maintain with national and international organisations. This article contributes to the debate surrounding the global fact-checking movement by raising awareness of regional and local fact-checking, which helps address so-called fact deserts.",

          "authors": "Bingbing Zhang, Heather Shoenberger",
          "abstract": "While recent research has demonstrated how exposure to cross-cutting political opinions intensifies politically motivated disconnectivity on social media, there has been a notable gap in examining the influence of emotions and psychological traits in this process. Guided by the theories of selective avoidance and affective intelligence, our study employed a survey through Qualtrics panel drawn from a population-matching sample (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 498) of the US population to investigate how perceived political disagreement on social media affects decisions to unfollow and unfriend others through the induction of affective responses (e.g., anger, anxiety) and the role of psychological trait—need to belong. Controlling for demographics and political ideology, our mediation analysis revealed that perceived political disagreement was significantly related to anger, which was further positively associated with both unfollowing and unfriending on social media. Perceived political disagreement was also related to anxiety while anxiety was positively associated with individuals’ behaviors of unfollowing and unfriending. Furthermore, results showed that the need to belong played a significant role in moderating the relationship between perceived political disagreement and unfriending. When perceiving the same level of political disagreement, individuals with a higher need to belong were less likely to unfriend others on social media, compared to those with a lower need to belong. However, the need to belong did not exert a significant impact on how perceived political disagreement influenced unfollowing behavior. This study contributes to understanding the nuanced dynamics of disconnectivity on social media, particularly in navigating political disagreements.",

          "abstract": "This thematic issue explores the global fact-checking field, focusing on its organizations, practices, and institutional dynamics. Over the past decade, fact-checking has expanded to over 400 organizations, with approximately half operating in the Global South. Fact-checkers have built a solid institutional framework featuring annual conferences, regulatory bodies, and partnerships with big techs and public organizations. Even with this cohesion, the fact-checking movement remains deeply heterogeneous. Organizations range from small local outlets to global media giants, operating within varied media and political systems. These differences shape how fact-checkers define their mission and approach misinformation, and offer a valuable lens for journalism and political communication studies to analyze evolving media systems and digitalization effects worldwide. Given such diversity, our issue addresses the need for research to observe regional and comparative perspectives on fact-checking alongside studies of broader global trends. Recent scholarship has focused on how fact-checkers adapt to diverse environments, particularly in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and how the field is evolving. It also examines fact-checkers’ relationships with platform companies, policymakers, and transnational institutions combating misinformation. Contributions employing diverse methodologies, from case studies to large-scale content analyses, are included, with a particular emphasis on understanding organizational and contextual specificities in this crucial area of media and political communication.",

          "authors": "Michal Frackowiak, Pascale Sophie Russell, Matthew J. Vowels, Peter Hilpert",
          "abstract": "Studies show that the use of smartphones in the presence of a partner may result in lower relationship quality, intimacy, and increased conflict. Such co-present phone use, often referred to as “phubbing” or “technoference,” has been problematized in the literature. However, few studies have hitherto explored the possibility that using phones in each other's presence may not cause any relational harm and might even support relationship maintenance. Only recently did the critiques and theoretical frameworks begin to expand our understanding of the broader role of smartphones in dyadic interactions. In this study, we tested whether co-present phone use is always perceived as negative, or if it could also be neutral or positive. We employed quantitative methods and content coding of free responses to understand the participants’ experiences and reasoning in different evaluations. We analyzed the responses of British participants ( N = 383) living with their partner, who were enrolled via Prolific to take part in the study. The analyses revealed that only 15% of participants perceived their partner's phone use as negative, the majority evaluating it as neutral or positive. Most participants reported that their partner's phone use had no impact on their time together or was integrated with other activities. Those who reported a negative impact attributed it to the partner's lack of attention. The present study challenges the existing literature and highlights the need for a conceptual expansion of smartphone-related behaviors in dyads.",

          "abstract": "How do social support and the use of social media contribute to mental health and resilience among those who are pursuing a new path of identity and life? Those who exit ultra-Orthodox Judaism often struggle with loss of social support while simultaneously increasing their use of social media. We conducted a cross-cultural survey among 1146 individuals who left ultra-Orthodox Judaism. Our findings show that escapist and avoidant coping through social media correlated with more negative mental health outcomes, while using social media to problem solve and perceiving oneself as giving and receiving social support correlated with more positive outcomes. Resilience negatively associated with escapist and avoidant styles of coping through social media. Some aspects of perceived social support had positive associations with resilience. These findings shed light on potentially helpful mechanisms for using social media among marginalized communities, specifically those who exit high-cost religious communities.",

With three key research questions, the study explores the prevalence, characteristics, effects on mental well-being and professional fulfillment, and the coping strategies employed by the victims to counteract cyberviolence. The study concludes by stressing the urgency of targeted and efficient interventions and evidence-based policies to address the gendered nature of online harassment. In spite of its limitations, the research lays the ground for further studies and collaboration to secure safer online environments for female academics in Morocco.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the association of socioeconomic status (SES) and digital and AI literacy with types of Chat GPT use by college students, with subsequent implications for academic self-efficacy and creativity, conditioned by trust. Analyses of a survey of U.S. college students (N = 947) show that SES has a greater association with AI literacy than with general digital literacy. Two dimensions of Chat GPT activities emerge: academic support and displacement. Structural equation modeling reveals that AI literacy is positively associated with both activity dimensions, while digital literacy is unexpectedly a negative contributor. Further, academic support is strongly linked to positive outcomes whereas academic displacement is negatively associated. Attitudinal trust in Chat GPT moderates the overall relationships. Our findings suggest that conventional digital inequality persists and evolves with generative AI, traditional digital literacy becomes insufficient in the age of AI, and trust in this new and opaque digital technology influences these relationships.",

          "abstract": "This six-wave longitudinal survey study investigated associations between perceived smartphone overuse and the use of technology-based disconnection strategies. The sample was representative of the Dutch population regarding age, gender, and education level ( N = 1674). Linear mixed models showed that perceived overuse was positively related to self-reported screen time and motivations to reduce screen time. People with higher perceived overuse were more likely to adopt disconnection strategies in the following 2 months. Yet, surprisingly, at the within-person level, we found that when someone experienced more overuse than they normally do, they were not more likely to adopt disconnection strategies. Moreover, using disconnection strategies in the previous 2 months was related to higher perceived overuse and self-reported screen time. Together, these findings suggest that people do not always take action when unsatisfied with their smartphone use, and when they do, technology-based disconnection strategies are not effective in reducing perceived smartphone overuse.",

          "abstract": "Close relationships are associated with many positive outcomes throughout life, including improved physical health and well‐being. Traditionally, theory and research on the health benefits of close relationships have focused on either the total amount of support perceived available within a person's entire social network or the support provided by romantic partners (Shankar et al. in Psychology and Health , 30(6), 686–698; 2015). Limited work has examined the impact of distinct relationship types, particularly friends. In this article, we address this critical gap in our current knowledge. First, we identify the features of friends and friendship networks that distinguish them from other types of adult relationships, especially romantic relationships. Second, we use the strength and strain model (Slatcher &amp; Selcuk in Current Directions in Psychological Science , 26(1), 16–21; 2017) as a framework to consider how adult friendships might impact physical health in ways similar to but also distinct from romantic partners. Utilizing this specific model, we identify features of friendships—the size and structure of friendship networks, the norms that define friendships, and the levels of interdependence in friendships—and discuss how each feature can amplify or blunt the strengths and strains afforded by friends, including their impact on health. Finally, we provide a roadmap and identify priorities to advance research on friendships and physical health.",

          "abstract": "Many conspiracy theories implicate scientists and science. We investigated the impact of exposure to scientific conspiracies about biotechnologies. Across three preregistered online studies ( Ns = 1,000), participants who read information about conspiracies involving agribiotechnology companies or biobank scientists were more likely to endorse conspiracies. Other effects of exposure to conspiracy information were mixed. In Study 1, reading about an agricultural biotechnology conspiracy had a small significant effect on reducing intentions to eat genetically modified food. In Study 2, exposure to a conspiracy involving biobank scientists decreased support for biobanks, mediated by decreased trust in biobank scientists. In Study 3, this conspiracy had no effect on wider beliefs of the role of science in society (science populism), nor support of genetically modified food-promoting policies. Overall, we found that exposure to conspiracies involving scientific claims increased conspiracy belief endorsement and can further negative effects. However, the effects of conspiracies on science populism appear limited.",

Using structural equation modelling ( N = 1,002), we found significant associations between perceived AI explainability and all trust dimensions (i.e., performance, purpose, process). Additionally, we revealed that the public acquired the perception of AI explainability through attention to AI in the news media. Consequently, we found that when the public pondered upon support for autonomous passenger drones, only the trust in performance dimension was relevant. Our findings underscore the importance of ensuring explainability for the public and highlight the pivotal role of news media in shaping public perceptions in emerging AI technologies.

We conducted a lexicometric study of 343 French press articles with a hierarchical descending classification analysis and a correspondence analysis. Results indicate an evolution in the media treatment of human genome editing, from a popularization perspective to a focus on ethical and legislative aspects of genome editing.

          "abstract": "Trust in science is crucial to resolving societal problems. Americans across political ideologies have high levels of trust in science—a stable pattern observed over the past 50 years. Yet, trust in science varies by individual and group characteristics and faces several threats, from political actors, increased political polarization, or global crises. We revisit historical trends of trust in science among Americans by political orientation. We find steadily diverging trends by political views since the 1990s, and a drastically and rapidly opening gap since 2018. Recent unprecedented changes are driven not only by decreases in trust among conservatives but also by increases among liberals. Existing theoretical accounts do not fully explain these patterns. Diverging attitudes toward the institution of science can diminish capacity for collective problem-solving, eroding the shared foundation for decision-making and political discourse.",

A demand-side explanation is that female experts are less frequently asked to give their opinion; a supply-side explanation is that, conditional on being asked, female experts are less willing to give their opinion. Analysing an existing panel of expert economists, all asked for their opinions on a broad range of issues, we find evidence of a supply-side gap: male panel members are more likely to give an opinion, and this is the case in all fields of economics and on both in-field and out-of-field topics.",

The results show a preponderance of GN/Majority cases and non-region-specific social media groupings such as hashtag publics, particularly in research employing digital methods.

          "abstract": "Social media is increasingly viewed as a venue for organized peacebuilding efforts. However, current research has paid little attention to the vast array of everyday, self-organized social media interactions that could help overcome societal divisions. This article analyses the role of online memes in everyday online reconciliation, using Sri Lanka’s 2022 political crisis as a case study. We argue that memes contribute to a DIY-approach to dealing with the past, helping to renegotiate inter-group boundaries in the aftermath of conflict. Memes articulate grievances, but they also engage with inter-group relations in a playful manner, thus enabling both a “sincere” and a “subjunctive” approach to group relations by describing them both as they “are” as well as how they “could be.” In combination, they can be used as a “weapon of the weak,” through which vulnerable social media users may communicate in ways that transcend dominant perspectives on group relations.",

          "authors": "Michael Hameleers, Marie Garnier Ortiz",
          "abstract": "Mis- and disinformation have been associated with detrimental political consequences, such as increasing ideological and epistemic polarization. Yet, we know little about how people perceive the risks of misinformation across countries and domains of information. As holding high-risk perceptions of encountering misinformation across domains may result in high levels of media cynicism and uncertainty, it is important to explore news users’ relative risk perceptions related to mis- and disinformation. Therefore, this article relies on original survey data collected in seven countries: Argentina ( N = 507), Brazil ( N = 650), Chile ( N = 485), Mexico ( N = 461), the United States ( N = 521), Spain ( N = 576), and the Netherlands ( N = 518) (total N = 3,718). Main findings indicate that news users arrive at high estimates of mis- and disinformation’s proportion across all countries. Although higher-risk information domains (i.e., political advertising) are generally more likely to be associated with misinformation than lower-risk domains (i.e., scientific evidence), our findings foreground important country-level differences that relate to varying levels of resilience across the seven democracies studied. Our findings offer important evidence for the relative assessments of risk related to misinformation across contexts that vary on vulnerability to the threats of misinformation.",

          "abstract": "News consumption and voting behavior are interlinked and particularly important in elections where traditional political cleavages are not easily applicable. This relationship becomes more complex and uncertain in contexts of low trust in the news media and high levels of misinformation circulating in different news ecosystems. In this study, we test an indirect path between differentiated news media consumption and voting choices, mediated by belief in misinformation, and moderated by news media trust. Our data come from a two-wave panel survey of 1,332 respondents, conducted in Chile before and after the 2022 Constitutional Referendum, a political event that captured international attention after a constitutional proposal was rejected in a process initiated with high public support. Our analyses found that news media consumption significantly affected voting preferences in the referendum, not only indirectly through the acceptance of misinformation, but also directly, suggesting that news organizations might act, intentionally or not, as soundboards of misinformation. These findings suggest that countries with enough press freedom to rely on the news media to be informed but also a high concentration of ownership, topics, and angles covered, might become fertile soil for misinformation to spread in the form of professional news coverage, instead of fabricated, easy-to-spot fake pieces circulating in dubious websites or on social media.",
