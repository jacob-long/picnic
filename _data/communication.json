          "authors": "Gitte Balling, Marianne Martens",
          "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, TikTok quickly became an important source for connection and entertainment, as people made creative videos and participated in TikTok challenges. The app’s affordances contributed to the emergence of sub-communities, including BookTok, which connected readers across a sociotechnical landscape, and launched backlist titles onto best-seller lists. Using interviews with publishers and booksellers in Denmark and the United States, observations of booksellers’ in-store BookTok displays, and analysis of content created by publishers and online influencers on BookTok, this study examines how BookTok disrupts Darnton’s (1982) Communications Circuit and its subsequent revisions. It explores the impact of BookTok on the landscape of book production and dissemination, the creation of new genres like romantasy within, and how publishers and booksellers are leveraging the organic landscape of BookTok to authentically market to readers.",

          "abstract": "Using the concepts of data reflectivity and user reflexivity, this paper explores the intricate interplay between human users and algorithms through the lens of domestication. Through the metaphor of yanghao on the Chinese digital platform Xiaohongshu (RED), this paper posits that three failure types relating to data reflectivity result in dissatisfaction with RED’s algorithmic outputs and a perceived loss of control over algorithmic identity. In response, users reflexively feed six specific types of data into the algorithm to shape its understanding of themselves. Ultimately, by strategically curating data and interacting with an algorithm, yanghao demonstrates a successful domestication process, highlighting how data reflectivity and user reflexivity empower users to gain agency within the human–algorithm power dynamic.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores how non-experts reflect on and come to understand ‘data uses’, a phrase we used to refer to data collection, analysis and sharing. In recent years, research into what people think and feel about data uses has proliferated, whereas this paper focuses on how they do their thinking and feeling. We argue that imagining – that is, building or creating a mental image of something that is not present – is an important aspect of reflecting on data uses. We challenge the proposition that imagining takes place when there is a gap in knowledge or a lack of information, arguing instead that imagining plays an agentic role in reflection, enabling critical questioning of data uses. We draw on qualitative research carried out in the UK, in which we provided information about specific public sector data uses and asked participants how they felt about them. We found that imaginings, or ‘what ifs’, exist in a complex entanglement with different knowledges, including experiential knowledge.",

          "abstract": "The censorship of Boys’ Love (BL) content in mainland China is marked by inconsistencies in both its intensity and scope. Amid these shifting regulatory boundaries, this study analyzes the systematic removal and occasional reappearance of visual BL content from the public sphere. We found that as visual channels are most susceptible to suppression, audio – though still monitored – emerges as a crucial medium, leveraging the agentive power of sound and media remediation to sustain fan engagement with BL narratives. Focusing on Miss Evan, a Chinese audio streaming platform, we explore how it navigates state censorship and market marginalization while restoring the BL subculture through innovative design features, sexually appealing voice performances, and provocative sound effects. Additionally, we investigate the agency of Chinese BL fans in reclaiming BL’s presence through polymedia engagement. We argue that the dynamic negotiation between the platform, state censorship, and fandom reveals an ongoing contest between queer marginalization and restoration. While the platform seeks mainstream acceptance by conforming to censorship through the minimization of queer visual representation, the BL fandom employs counterstrategies to sustain the subculture in audio form. This tension highlights the cultural resilience and technological adaptability of queer subcultures as they navigate and resist the censorship imposed by state and societal norms.",

          "abstract": "The communicative environment of public service media (PSM) has changed considerably due to the digital transformation. This includes the dissemination of misinformation and disinformation on social media platforms, which has the potential to undermine democracy. Against this background, the paper argues that the role of PSM should be expanded beyond the core tasks of high-quality, diverse and impartial reporting. PSM should increasingly also act as institutions that monitor social media, evaluate, and validate external information. In addition, they should engage in enhancing media literacy and developing genuine PSM platforms. The paper discusses the opportunities and limitations of each approach and addresses prerequisites for PSM, such as political independence and societal trust. It thus contributes to the understanding how PSM can continue to fulfil their democratic role under new conditions.",

          "abstract": "The aim of this article is to present an updated version of our previous theory of gameplay. “Gameplay” is a term often used without a clear definition or consistent application. In this article, we propose categorizing gameplay into three distinct yet interconnected layers: the first emphasizing temporality, the second highlighting spatiality, and the third pinpointing emotion as anchor point. Our model and understanding are influenced by the philosophy of phenomenology, particularly Husserl's objective examination of the first-person perspective in perceptual experience—a commendable approach for blending formalism with real-time experience without resorting to subjectivism or psychologism. We offer an analytical and methodological framework for understanding gameplay, relying on micro-tensions to elucidate gameplay as a structural entity as well as an experiential phenomenon. As we shall demonstrate, micro-tensions are present within each of the three layers, paving the way for the entirety of gameplay—referred to by gamers as “great gameplay.”",

          "authors": "Gordon Liu, Yue Meng-Lewis, Weiyue Wang, Yupei Zhao",
          "abstract": "Purpose The rapid growth of professional esports has highlighted the lack of a universally recognised governing body to standardise operations and competition rules. This absence presents many challenges. A key concern is the well-being of professional esports players (e-pro-players), who often suffer from exhaustion. This study aims to examine the factors contributing to exhaustion among e-pro-players. Design/methodology/approach Using the conservation of resources theory, we developed a framework to explain the factors leading to e-pro-players’ exhaustion and the conditions under which it occurs. We tested this framework with 126 responses in a dyadic survey from e-pro-players and their coaches in China. Additionally, we gathered qualitative insights from 50 interviews with esports stakeholders to provide more context for our quantitative findings. Findings Our study found that e-pro-players’ intrinsic motivation to engage in training reduces their exhaustion, while their struggle to cope with uncertainty in esports environments (intolerance of uncertainty) increases it. The effect of intrinsic motivation is weaker for those who believe their talent for playing esports is fixed (entity belief) but stronger for those with high relational identification with their coaches. Additionally, the link between uncertainty intolerance and exhaustion is stronger in players with strong entity beliefs. Originality/value Our study sheds light on the factors contributing to e-pro-players’ exhaustion within the partially regulated professional esports environment, a phenomenon that significantly influences their overall well-being. Through the identification and examination of these factors and the conditions under which they affect exhaustion, we deepen the understanding of the drivers of exhaustion for e-pro-players who operate in an industry lacking standardised regulations.",

          "authors": "Ishaan Sengupta, Kokil Jain, Arpan Kumar Kar, Isha Sharma",
          "abstract": "Purpose Influencer transgressions can disappoint their followers. However, there is a lack of clarity about the effects of a false allegation on an influencer–follower relationship. Drawing from cognitive dissonance and moral reasoning theory, the current study aims to examine how this relationship is shaped across three time periods (before the allegation is leveled, after the allegation is leveled, and when the allegation is found to be baseless). Design/methodology/approach We study comments posted by followers of two falsely alleged social media influencers (SMI) on their YouTube and Instagram channels. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) followed by netnography is used for thematic analysis. LDA is a social media topic modeling method that processes a statistically representative set of words to explain the tone and tenor of qualitative conversations. A sentiment analysis of the comments is done using SentiStrength. Findings When an allegation is leveled initially, the response from followers is overwhelmingly negative toward the influencer owing to moral coupling. However, when the allegations are proven to be false, the followers return to a positive opinion of the influencer, owing to feelings of dissonance and guilt. Practical implications The study contributes to the fields of influencer marketing, cognitive dissonance and moral reasoning. It highlights how endorsers can take advantage of the positive sentiment that arises once an accused SMI’s transgression is proven false. Originality/value This study introduces the concept of “Sentiment Reversal,” which is exhibited in the social media space. In this phenomenon, sentiments move from negative to positive toward the falsely accused SMI as they are vindicated of the previous charge.",

          "authors": "Xiaoyu Chen, Alton Y.K. Chua",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study examines the phenomenon of “knowledge influencers,” individuals who convey expert information to non-expert audiences and attract users to subscribe to their self-created knowledge products. It seeks to address two research questions: (1) What are the antecedents that promote perceived attractiveness of knowledge influencers? and (2) How does perceived attractiveness of knowledge influencers affect users’ willingness to subscribe to knowledge products? Design/methodology/approach Guided by self-branding theory, which suggests that individuals strategically shape user perceptions and interactions to create an appealing image, the study employed a sequential mixed-methods approach. Qualitative interviews were conducted with knowledge influencers and their subscribers, followed by a quantitative survey of users with knowledge subscription experience to validate the findings. Findings Results suggested that knowledge influencers could enhance their attractiveness to users by promoting perceived professionalism, perceived familiarity, and perceived connectedness. Perceived attractiveness of knowledge influencers could directly affect users’ willingness to subscribe or indirectly through the role of users’ attachment to knowledge influencers. Practical implications By understanding the factors driving users’ subscription intentions, platform operators and influencers can refine their strategies to enhance user attachment and optimize monetization opportunities through personalized interactions and tailored content offerings. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature by elucidating the relationship between perceived attractiveness and users’ subscription intentions, offering new insights into the dynamics of online knowledge consumption.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study explores the potential impact of enterprise social media (ESM) communication visibility on knowledge sabotage to reduce knowledge sabotage within organizations. Design/methodology/approach We collected data from 389 Chinese employees across three stages and used hierarchical regression analysis and the bootstrap method to test our hypotheses. Findings Communication visibility negatively affects knowledge sabotage, and the loss of knowledge power mediates the relationship between communication visibility and knowledge sabotage. Digital work connectivity strengthens the negative relationship between message transparency and loss of knowledge power but weakens the negative relationship between network translucence and loss of knowledge power. Therefore, digital work connectivity plays a dual role. Practical implications Managers can encourage employees to share their knowledge advantages through ESM and seek cross-disciplinary knowledge cooperation, which helps restrain knowledge sabotage from the source. At the same time, maintaining appropriate digital work connectivity enables employees to leverage their knowledge interaction advantages of ESM, thereby fostering their knowledge competitiveness. Originality/value This study is the first to reveal the internal mechanism (loss of knowledge power) through which ESM communication visibility affects knowledge sabotage and explores the boundary condition (digital work connectivity) impacting the effectiveness of communication visibility. It contributes to a deeper understanding of the inherent nature of knowledge sabotage from an information technology perspective and offers novel technical insights into its management.",

We analyzed 76,217 publications from 73 communication journals, spanning from 1990 to 2023, with a focus on racial diversity in authorship as an indicator of collaboration diversity. Our results reveal that diversity is positively associated with the number of citations received, with this positive effect increasing over time. In addition, non-White lead authors collaborated more diversely, whereas White authors exhibited a faster increase in collaboration diversity over the years. Furthermore, the positive association between collaboration diversity and citations was more pronounced when the lead author was non-White than when White. Additional analyses show a concerning disparity: While non-White first authors are equally likely as their White counterparts to publish in top journals, they receive significantly fewer citations.",

          "abstract": "Previous theorizing suggests that the first stage of self-disclosure is the pursuit of an interpersonal goal. However, among individuals disclosing a concealable stigmatized identity, little is known about how their goals impact downstream processes such as language use and post-disclosure affect. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), we examined the extent to which primed self-image or compassionate goals influence the linguistic content and style of disclosure, as well as dyad members’ affective states. Self-image disclosures were high in negative self-focused attention, whereas compassionate disclosures were more inclusive and positive in valence. Moreover, among disclosers, negative emotion words predicted their own negative affect. Among confidants, first-person singular and second-person pronouns predicted negative affect, however, this outcome was inversely related to disclosers’ use of social words. Compassionate goals that seek mutually beneficial outcomes may help disclosers communicate information about their stigma more effectively, and attenuate dyad members’ feelings of emotional distress.",

We selected 10 countries with the highest Human Development Index (HDI) and 10 countries with the lowest. The sentiment analysis provided scores indicating the degree of positivity in the descriptions of these countries provided by ChatGPT. The results revealed that ChatGPT generally expressed positive sentiments about all countries. However, strong evidence emerged showing that countries with high HDI received more positive sentiments compared to those with low HDI. These findings highlight the bias of the model in describing developed versus developing countries. Ultimately, the study highlights the importance of adjusting large language models to ensure fairer representations of countries.",

          "abstract": "Past research has found that people often engage in one of three behaviours to resolve inconsistencies with others: validation, conforming, or distancing. While much of the social influence literature has assessed contexts in which conformity is more or less likely, little has explored alternatives to conformity, such as validation and distancing. The present research as aims to assess what underlying factors that affect these preferences. We used vignettes of inconsistency in relational contexts to assess people’s preferred responses. In Study 1, we assessed Canadian participants’ preferences responses following social inconsistency. We found that more perceived self-changeability increased preference for conformity and decreased preference for validation and distancing, while more perceived relational mobility increased preference for distancing and decreased preference for conformity and validation. In Study 2 we assessed how these behaviours may vary culturally. We found that compared to Canadians, Koreans expressed greater preference for conformity and less preference for validation. The patterns of results for perceived changeability and mobility were largely the same across Canadian and Korean, with Koreans demonstrating similar or smaller effects. Implications and limitations of these findings are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Intimate partner violence is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa with women the usual victims. Efforts to address intimate partner violence (IPV) include interventions with information communication technologies (ICT) that are being used to raise awareness and promote the empowerment of women. Thus, there is a need to examine the relationship between ICT ownership and IPV among women in sub-Saharan Africa. We conducted a cross-sectional study of four countries in sub-Saharan Africa using the Demographic and Health Survey data. Ownership of ICT was the main predictor variable that was measured by ownership of a radio, television, mobile phones, and access to the Internet. The outcome variable was IPV, which was measured in two forms: physical and sexual violence. A multivariable analysis using binary logistic regression was used to examine the association between ownership of ICT devices and intimate partner violence (IPV) among women. In Zambia and Mali, women who own ICT devices were significantly less likely to experience sexual violence than those who did not own ICT devices. Predictors such as age, place of residence, education, wealth status, employment status, number of children and age at first marriage were significantly associated with experiences of IPV, even though the strength of this relationship varied across countries and types of IPV. Access to ICT should be promoted among women because ICT can raise awareness and offer women a platform for receiving social support and advice about coping with intimate partner violence.",

Negative binomial regressions revealed that the explicit populist style, which articulates “the people” and “the harmful others” in the same message unit, predicts user engagement. The study shows that explicit populism triggers more favorites, retweets, and replies than any other populist style.

          "abstract": "In recent decades, there has been a growing interest in studying the appeal of digital games. However, there is still a call for further research, especially on the theoretical and methodological advancements. Hence, a novel approach and a concept of the Digital Gaming Relationship (DGR) is presented. The DGR model is adapted from earlier work on physical activity and with the central concept as “meaning,” it provides an alternative perspective to motivation-oriented literature for the field of game studies. With this approach, the fundamental view is that each person has a varying relationship with digital games and gaming over their life span. The relationship builds on the individual’s encounters with the social world of digital gaming and its cultural meanings. In the long term, accruing digital gaming-related knowledge, experiences, and emotional connections contributes to a rich tapestry of meaning, thus creating a deep and meaningful relationship capable of shaping one’s actions, behaviors, and even identity. The framework theorizes the mechanisms of an individual’s socialization process to the digital gaming world and illustrates that the relationship with digital games includes much more than just playing them. In this article, the theoretical roots and key concepts of the DGR are introduced, and the practical applicability of the approach is discussed.",

          "abstract": "Fact-checking in Ethiopia is doubly challenged. First, because Ethiopia is ruled by an authoritarian government, which restricts the information environment, and second, because the conflict in northern Ethiopia that erupted in November 2020 has made disinformation more rampant, and its implications deadly. But fact-checking in Ethiopia is the product not only of the work of Ethiopian organizations: local fact-checkers international allies and funders also play important roles. This article explores the practice of fact-checking by local organizations and the challenges they encounter in this work in an authoritarian, conflict-affected context. It also serves as a case study shedding light on the interplay between Ethiopian fact-checking organizations and their allies in the international development sector. Local and international organizations have distinct positions within the fact-checking ecosystem and funder (grantee relationships, and funders, at times, compound local organizations’ challenges). This research reflects information gathered through semi-structured interviews with local fact-checkers and their international allies, as well as a qualitative content analysis of publicly available materials and social media channels. Its findings imply that local fact-checking organizations, their funders, and allied international organizations interact in complex ways in challenging environments.",

This manuscript shares the results of a mixed methods survey of individuals (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 751) recruited via online forums who recalled their experiences playing as female game characters. We analyzed qualitative response data using a traditional, top-down approach to identify themes. We focus our analysis and discussion on the results of a human-derived analysis, which indicated both positive and negative dimensions of experiences that participants found meaningful. Participants reported that taking on the role of a female character was often very important to them, but the reason for this significance varied across players. Often, these reasons involved their own gender identities and the context in which the gameplay occurred (e.g., online multiplayer). We consider findings as evidence of eudaimonic media effects.",

          "abstract": "The concept of digital disconnection, which refers to limiting digital media use for the sake of one’s well-being, has gained prominence in scholarly and public debates. Compared to a burgeoning digital disconnection industry that commodifies individuals’ struggles with constant connectivity, the development of evidence-based disconnection policies and regulations that support individuals to maintain digital well-being lags behind. The absence of digital disconnection policy may partly be due to a lack of studies investigating the contextual and institutional conditions in which policies and regulations are designed, implemented, and received. The few studies that do shed light on these conditions show that politicians’ and policymakers’ responses to digitalization involve discourses of individual responsibilization. Building on these insights, our study draws from in-depth interviews with 21 experts from organizations in Flanders (Belgium) who are responsible for digital well-being and digital disconnection across work, school, and family contexts. In particular, we have explored their perspectives on the challenges of constructing and implementing digital disconnection policies and regulations. Overall, the experts’ discourses reveal a conflict between striving for autonomy and the need for regulations concerning digital disconnection. This conflict leads to a digital disconnection policy paradox in which experts advocate for collective disconnection initiatives but ultimately resort to solutions on an individual level. We discuss the implications of our findings for the scholarly field of digital disconnection as well as for media policymakers.",

          "title": "Mediating the Sugar Baby Imaginary: Popular Narratives About Gender and Sexuality in Sugar Dating",
          "authors": "Megan Sawey",
          "abstract": "The internet is rife with opportunities to participate in dating practices, discourses about gender, romance, and sexuality, and, increasingly, efforts to restrict sexual expression. Therefore, it is important to square popular discourse with the perspectives and thought processes that color women’s participation in romantic and sexual phenomena. This article explores how media narratives about women who pursue relationships at the intersection of intimacy, social class, and labor map onto the realities of their lived experiences. Specifically, I compare an analysis of popular press articles about sugar dating—a mutually beneficial relationship practice wherein people engage in frank negotiations of companionship, intimacy, and material benefits—with interviews with 13 women who have participated in sugar dating. I sought to understand how these women defined sugar dating, what motivated them to sugar date, and where their sugar relationships felt most rewarding or difficult. I argue that, for women, sugar dating can be a site of both labor and leisure. These interviews complicate how contemporary press coverage tends to frame sugar dating, revealing important insights about how women may conform to but also challenge popular narratives about their identities, labor, sexual desires, and agency. My findings, therefore, constitute a narrative about sugar dating that captures the nuances of women’s thinking and operating logics. This is a crucial step forward in elevating the voices of those who participate in sugar dating and other romantic and sexual practices.",

          "abstract": "This article focuses on the links between academic research and educational practices, examining how practitioners use, contextualize, and co-construct research findings on digital skills. To explore these issues, firstly we present an education toolkit developed within a European research project and aligned with normative and substantive guidelines for science communication. Aiming to grasp the potentialities and limitations of the toolkit in action, we then explore the perceptions of teachers from two educational settings in Portugal who employed it in their classrooms. Subsequent focus groups evidenced overall positive feedback from teachers, complemented by practical tips to improve the usefulness of the toolkit and adherence to it by teachers and students, thus adding layers of knowledge to the performative dimension of an evidence-based resource and building bridges between the academic and professional worlds.",

          "abstract": "Calls to “do your own research” (DYOR) on social media promote a range of claims, from expert-recommended treatments to conspiracy theories. Exploring how the slogan is used offers insight into how individuals navigate concerns about information accuracy in an abundant but low-trust media ecosystem. This quantitative content analysis investigates how DYOR messages in Facebook and Instagram posts about reproductive health, food and diet, and vaccination are used to raise alarms, promote personal agency, and disclaim responsibility. We additionally examine how DYOR messages are associated with content including risk information and product promotion. While DYOR messages sometimes raise alarms about suspected conspiracies and misinformation, more often they advocate for personal agency and education, encouraging people to become as informed as possible to make the best decisions for themselves. In this way, DYOR messages promote individual responsibility for navigating information risks and reflect wider concerns about (mis-)information and distrust of institutions.",

          "abstract": "There has been much debate concerning the changing nature of cultural production and distribution in the digital creative economy. Music production work has been especially affected by promotional conventions established by social media and music streaming platforms. This article critically builds atop perspectives on the platformisation of cultural production to investigate how independent hip-hop music producers develop their careers in the era of digital media platforms. It examines how traditional media and digital platform gatekeepers affect producers’ abilities to professionalise, promote creative work to audiences and manage precarious conditions for their labour. Insights from interviews with 15 producers from 8 countries are analysed and discussed to provide a nuanced view of the conditions for music production careers in the platform era of the digital creative industries.",

          "abstract": "A 2 (influencer type: nano with 5000 followers vs mega with 1.1 million followers) × 2 (influencer self-disclosure: low depth vs high depth) between-subjects online experiment tested the different pathways social media influencers take to achieve persuasion outcomes in one model. Participants viewed an Instagram influencer’s profile page with either 5000 or 1.1 million followers, and a post from the influencer with either low or high depth self-disclosure. Participants then answered questions regarding social attraction, parasocial relationship, perceived expertise, persuasion outcomes, covariates, and demographic information. Results showed three serial pathways facilitate persuasion: two pathways through self-disclosure depth by way of social attraction and parasocial relationship development and another pathway through follower size by way of perceived expertise. This research advances understanding of the influencing process by using theory and empirical precedent to derive and test an integrated model of the influencing process.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of Fitspiration on women’s body shame and sexual assertiveness. By integrating the tripartite influence model’s focus on media influence with self-objectification theory, we explore the mechanisms connecting Fitspiration consumption to female sexual autonomy. Specifically, we examine the mediating roles of perceived realism, ideal body internalization, appearance comparison, and body shame, as well as the moderating effect of social media usage habits. Data from 818 Chinese women were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results indicate that exposure to Fitspiration content increases perceived realism, which in turn influences ideal body internalization and appearance comparison, leading to heightened body shame and reduced sexual assertiveness. In addition, social media usage habits further shape the relationship between media exposure and perceived realism.",

          "abstract": "Race and attraction studies are gaining popularity as conceptual frameworks explore the associations between racism, color blindness, race, and attraction. This study investigates the association between race and attraction by examining the connection between racial ideologies and bias. Same‐race bias in attraction is well documented in existing literature. This study explores whether the strength of same‐race bias is associated with color‐blind racial ideology, multiculturalism, and racial group membership. A sample of 374 Black and White young adults rated the attractiveness of six dating profiles. The results indicated that some associations between same‐race attraction and racial ideologies are moderated by participant race. Among White participants, greater color‐blind racial ideology was associated with stronger attraction to same‐race targets. By contrast, among Black participants, an opposite trend existed as greater color‐blind racial ideology was associated with a decrease in same‐race bias. Additionally, multiculturalism was associated with a decrease in same‐race bias among White participants. Further findings indicate that Black women and White men reported lower attraction to other‐race targets than Black men and White women. This study offers new insights into understanding racial bias in romantic attraction.",

          "abstract": "Studies in the field of child welfare services have shown that children's externalizing problems are linked to the immediate social relationships in which they are embedded. However, most studies that examined this association focused on specific dyads or general social support, ignoring more diverse and complex patterns of relationships in which children are embedded. Therefore, this study used Social Network Analysis to analyze how compositional and structural properties of parents' personal networks predict externalizing problems of children in vulnerable family contexts. The sample consists of 70 parents who were enrolled in a home‐based family intervention in Switzerland. A hierarchical cluster analysis revealed three clusters based on the network composition: mixed, child‐oriented, and family of orientation. Child behavior problems were associated with the network clusters; school‐related problems, on the other hand, were additionally linked with support density in the personal networks of parents. The results show that children in vulnerable families are embedded in diverse network compositions and relational structures, which influence their externalizing problems in different ways.",

We examine how two satire types (gentle, harsh) influence perceived message credibility and information reliance, which we define as using the information in discussions or for attitudinal and behavioral changes. Using a partial mediation model, we found no effects of gentle satire, but harsh satire negatively influenced message credibility, which was positively linked to information reliance. Contrary to previous research, we found that the satire type matters. Practical implications include being cautious when using harsh satire.",

Our results illuminated the mediating role of likability in shaping perceptions of competence, where heightened likability positively influenced perceived competence. Moreover, exposure to science messages from female scientists significantly increased trust in science through a serial mediation model.

Literature on peace journalism, for instance, suggests that its adaptation across contexts is shaped by forces on several levels, including the influence of individual media practitioners. However, little research examines those likely to practice peace journalism nor the implications of these social profiles on the diffusion of the model more broadly. Drawing on field theory and 20 in-depth interviews with East African journalists conducted between 2020 and 2021, this study explores such questions by identifying shared dimensions of position and habitus across those who attend peace journalism trainings. Findings suggest that these individuals tend to be well educated, share common experiences with conflict, and hold similar interventionist role conceptions. Such findings illuminate the types of social transformations peace journalism may undergo as it is adapted across contexts, with implications for journalism theory and practice.",
