          "abstract": "The article explores the social role and implications of large language models (LLMs) through the lens of media theory. Rather than considering LLMs as advanced forms of artificial intelligence, I argue that a communication-focused perspective provides a more effective way to interpret their impact on information management in contemporary society and to address the associated ethical and operational challenges. Supported by information management tools such as archives, catalogs, and later search engines, previous communication media expanded the scope of communication, making it possible to reach more, distant, diverse, and possibly anonymous communication partners. LLMs now signify a new phase in the evolution of communication, as they function themselves as communication partners capable of responding autonomously to user queries in a personalized manner. This perspective highlights and explains the capabilities and limitations of various LLM-based chatbots and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models, while also addressing issues such as misalignment and hallucinations.",

          "title": "Before code, beyond screen: Media archeology and convergence friction in early VR art (1993–1995)",
          "authors": "Kaihei Hase",
          "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) has often been narrated as if it emerged ex nihilo , whether through Lanier’s early proclamations of a new epoch, Rheingold’s celebration of Sensorama, or, particularly in Japan, the rhetoric of a “first year of VR” that accompanied the release of the Oculus Rift. Yet from a cultural and artistic perspective, VR was not born “out of nothing” but is situated within historical genealogies of media such as panoramas, theater, cinema, and interactive art. This essay proposes the concept of convergence friction to describe VR’s distinctiveness: when heterogeneous media traditions intersect in VR, their tensions persist rather than resolve into unified forms. Unlike cinema and television, which quickly absorbed such frictions into stable narrative and broadcast languages, VR sustains them as productive resources. Through close readings of three seminal early works, Jeffrey Shaw’s EVE (1993), Brenda Laurel and Rachel Strickland’s Placeholder (1993), and Char Davies’s Osmose (1995), this essay traces how embodiment, collectivity, and bodily rhythm became principles of immersion while colliding with earlier media legacies. Contemporary VR artworks such as Notes on Blindness (2016), Carne y Arena (2017), Chalkroom (2018), and AI History 1890–2090 (2023) extend these frictions in new directions, demonstrating that VR is continually redefined at the threshold between past and future media. By theorizing VR as a site of convergence friction, this essay argues that its incompleteness, its refusal to settle into a stable language, is not a deficiency but the very condition of its artistic and cultural significance. VR is not ex nihilo but perpetually reborn, sustained by unresolved genealogies and anticipatory futures.",

          "authors": "Francisco W. Kerche, Tommaso Venturini",
          "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the very short and yet very rich story of a TikTok meme: the rise and fall of the dabloon fictive currency. We examine this story as an example of self-exciting trendiness: a common internet dynamic in which trendiness and cultural vibrancy become inextricably intertwined. In the case of the dabloons and of many other memetic phenomena in TikTok and other platforms, this connection creates a spiraling cycle of popularity that is as potent as it is cursory. TikTokers understood all too well that the dabloon currency was going to be a fad, but, rather than being discouraged by this ephemerality, they pushed it to its extremes. Like many online communities, they doubled down on the transience of their subculture, and did so in the most literal way, using the inflation of their currency to first escalate and then implode the trend. The rise and fall of the dabloon trend offers a cautionary tale about the accelerated cycles of online cultures and internet memes: an illustration of how online communities can create culture not despite but by means of their ephemerality.",

          "authors": "Qingting Zhao, Hao Gao",
          "abstract": "Purpose Despite significant progress in global literacy campaigns, millions of adults remain illiterate, particularly in rural areas. With the ubiquity of smartphones, illiterate and semi-literate populations are increasingly engaging with digital technologies. This study examines the vernacular affordances these users generate in everyday smartphone use and investigates how such affordances shape their cognitive, emotional, and social experiences. Design/methodology/approach The study draws on participatory observation and semi-structured interviews with 17 illiterate and semi-literate individuals in a rural village in Shanxi Province, China. Data were analyzed through thematic analysis guided by the framework of vernacular affordances. Findings The analysis identifies three vernacular affordance characteristics—from hidden to perceptible, accidental, and incomplete—and explains how they are realized through three pathways: intergenerational digital support (“digital back-feeding”), symbol–meaning matching, and practice through repetition. These pathways help transform initially opaque smartphone functions into perceptible ones, while also producing affordances that remain unstable or only partially realized. Despite these limitations, smartphone use enhanced informal learning, micro-literacy development, emotional intimacy, and social participation. Originality/value The study advances affordance theory by contextualizing vernacular affordances in a rural, low-literacy environment and by demonstrating their unstable, fragmented, and culturally embedded nature. It also shows that the classification of affordances integrates both theoretical insights and empirically derived characteristics. In practice, the findings highlight the importance of intergenerational digital mentorship, culturally sensitive interface design, and policies that promote not only access but also meaningful digital inclusion.",

          "authors": "Itoro Abraham, Juliana Sutanto, Ruilin Zhu, Mahsa Honary",
          "abstract": "Purpose The study of AI ethics is rapidly expanding, but West Africa faces a disadvantage due to the lack of available data and research. This leaves the region susceptible to the negative consequences of imported AI technologies. Our study helps to identify the root causes of unethical outcomes. It provides valuable insights for dealing with AI’sunethical outcomes and understanding the social changes it may bring while addressing the pressing need for research that explores the interaction between resources, power relations, and social norms that influence AI development from the developer’s perspective. Design/methodology/approach Following critical social theory, we interviewed 45 system developers from West Africa. We adopted the postcolonial theory to examine power dynamics in AI development, algorithm colonisation, technology mimicry and decolonisation. We applied the critical thematic analysis for the data analysis. Findings This study examines the power dynamics in global AI development through the lens of postcolonial theory, highlighting the dominance of the Global North, particularly corporations and research institutions in North America and Western Europe. This dominance extends beyond technological control, including narratives, resources and policymaking processes that influence AI’sglobal trajectory. Local entities in the Global South, such as those in West Africa, heavily depend on foreign vendors for AI technologies. This reliance curtails local autonomy and perpetuates a cycle of dependency reminiscent of historical colonial practices, a phenomenon described as technological imperialism, thus driving technology mimicry and algorithm colonisation. Originality/value Our research is a valuable and timely contribution to AI ethics, providing insightful perspectives on the ethical challenges posed by AI in West Africa. Our findings serve as an essential roadmap for shaping policy decisions related to AI education, governance, and design, aiming to promote inclusive and ethical development in West Africa. Through our rigorous theoretical analysis and practical insights, we aim to foster a culture of inclusive AI development, ethical excellence, social responsibility, and accountability in our rapidly evolving world.",

          "authors": "Xiaodong Qiu, Yuruo Zeng, Wen Wu, Xiaohan Cassie Xu",
          "abstract": "Purpose Product assembly is not only a functional step in product delivery but also a potentially meaningful hands-on experience for consumers. To reduce the potential difficulties encountered during assembly, some firms are replacing traditional manuals with chatbot guidance. However, the impact of such interventions on consumer responses remains underexplored. This research aims to investigate how chatbot support in product assembly tasks – specifically in static versus video formats – affects perceived meaningfulness and, in turn, evaluations of the brand and service. Design/methodology/approach We conducted two experiments: an online scenario-based experiment using a 3 (manual vs static chatbot vs video chatbot) × 2 (simple vs complex task) between-subjects design and a laboratory experiment in which participants completed actual product assembly tasks. ANOVA and PROCESS-based mediation and moderation analyses were used to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings The results demonstrate a serial mediation effect: chatbot guidance reduces consumers' perceived meaningfulness, which diminishes brand intimacy and, subsequently, service evaluations. The negative effect is strongest for video chatbot guidance. Importantly, these effects are attenuated when product assembly tasks are more complex or when consumers have lower hands-on ability. Originality/value This study advances the understanding of human–chatbot interaction by examining how chatbot support reshapes consumers’ assembly experiences. The findings highlight the importance of perceived meaningfulness and suggest that chatbot use should be tailored for consumers with lower hands-on abilities or for situations involving more complex tasks.",

          "authors": "Eoin Whelan, Ann O'Brien, Alma McCarthy",
          "abstract": "Purpose Since the lifting of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, the hybrid work arrangement has become widespread globally, yet its impact on employee well-being remains unclear. We argue that the combination of stressful interactions with information and communication technology (ICT) when working remotely and onsite inhibits hybrid workers from psychologically detaching from work, which ultimately has a negative impact on their well-being in the form of burnout. In addition, we consider what organisational supports (i.e. hybrid work location autonomy, workplace social support) are effective in buffering the negative impact of hybrid work technostress. Design/methodology/approach Integrating the theoretical perspectives of technostress with the stressor-detachment model, this study develops and empirically tests the pathways which explain how and when the specific technostress experienced by hybrid workers is associated with burnout. We tested our model with survey data collected from 405 full-time hybrid workers. Findings Our findings indicate that hybrid workers' impaired psychological detachment mediates the relationship between technostress and burnout, but this effect is evident only in remote work settings. Moreover, greater hybrid work location autonomy buffers the negative effect of technostress on psychological detachment when working remotely but no effect was found for workplace social support. Originality/value The downside of hybrid work arrangements on worker well-being has rarely been examined in prior research. Applying the technostress lens to hybrid work enables our study to reveal more nuanced relationships between the demands of ICT and the well-being of hybrid workers, where we find evidence of the distinction between in-office and remote technostress.",

          "authors": "Md Al Amin, Sayed Elhoushy, Tana Cristina Licsandru, Teidorlang Lyngdoh",
          "abstract": "Purpose Although artificial intelligence (AI) has been studied in marketing for over two decades, the field still lacks an integrative framework that explains how anthropomorphic AI influences consumer perceptions and behaviors. This article presents a systematic review to identify key traits and roles of anthropomorphic AI and how they shape consumer responses and outcomes through the customer journey lens. Design/methodology/approach Using a systematic review methodology, this article analyzes 122 articles through thematic coding. The analysis identifies seven aggregate dimensions, focusing on anthropomorphic AI traits and roles, their associated consumer response mechanisms, and outcomes across diverse interaction contexts. Findings Our analysis reveals four key findings: (1) anthropomorphic AI exhibits distinct traits (social, thinking, emotional, autonomous, and responsible) and roles (functional and relational), which (2) activate consumer response mechanisms (cognitive, affective, and social); (3) influence consumer journey outcomes (behavioral, hedonic, utilitarian, and sustainable); and (4) are moderated by consumer journey conditions (individual differences, interaction contexts, and interaction structures). Originality/value This article introduces a novel, three-stage Interaction–Activation–Outcome framework that explains how interactions with anthropomorphic AI, when its traits and roles are aligned, activate consumer response mechanisms and journey outcomes, with effects being moderated by journey conditions. It also proposes a 2 × 2 matrix illustrating how the intersections between anthropomorphic AI traits (single vs. multiple) and roles (functional vs. relational) necessitate different strategic approaches, offering practical managerial insights. The article concludes by outlining future research directions, including examination of human–AI collaborative journeys, and AI applications in sustainable and base-of-the-pyramid markets.",

          "authors": "Lingzhi Brian Fang, Liu Tang, Heng Yang",
          "abstract": "Purpose The aim of this study is to address the research gap in understanding the role of AI in the workplace, particularly by investigating how AI fosters job anxiety. By introducing the transactional theory of stress and coping (TTSC), this study engages with the conventional theory of stress and anxiety to determine the dual role of AI features in both exacerbating and alleviating job anxiety. Design/methodology/approach A large-scale survey was conducted, and 675 valid responses were collected. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to analyze the entire theoretical model. A bootstrapping analysis was applied to assess the serial mediating role of AI stress in linking AI features to job anxiety. Findings The results revealed that AI explainability significantly enhances job anxiety. Conversely, algorithm transparency emerges as a mitigating factor, reducing job anxiety. These findings underscore the dual impact of AI, which acts as both a stressor and a potential alleviator depending on its design characteristics. Research implications This study highlights that algorithmic transparency can effectively mitigate AI-induced stress and job anxiety, underscoring the need for firms and managers to implement AI cautiously while strengthening governance merchanisms and prioritizing employee well-being and skill development. AI developers and policymakers should advance human-centered transparency and regulatory safeguards to reduce workplace anxiety and protect employees in AI-enabled environments. Originality/value This study pioneers a focus on the complex effects of AI in the workplace, diverging from conventional research that predominantly emphasizes the supportive role of AI. By integrating the TTSC, this study theoretically advances the understanding of AI stress mechanisms and empirically demonstrates the paradoxical effects of AI features. The dual-role framework offers novel insights for both academics and practitioners in addressing AI-related workplace challenges.",

          "abstract": "Purpose While wearable self-trackers (WSTs) are marketed for self-care, fitness, and health improvement, emerging evidence highlights the potential for negative impacts. This article explores the use of WSTs adopting a practice theory approach to unravel the contextual and individual factors that shape different patterns of WST usage and consumer vulnerability to harm. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and visual stimuli of self-tracking data was conducted with 30 Fitbit users. Data were analysed using thematic analysis, followed by idiographic and cross-case analysis to map usage patterns and reflexivity. Findings Three distinct WST usage patterns were identified: light, fluctuant and intensive. The study finds that reflexivity on physical activity identity and goals plays a key role in shaping these patterns, with users' critical capacity in identity transitions emerging as a key underpinning factor in vulnerability to harm. Practical implications To mitigate potential harms and promote healthier self-tracking practices, the study suggests the application of safe design, transparency and accountability principles, accounting for individual goals and experience levels, and tailored guidance and educational support for users. Originality/value This research focuses on the context of self-tracking and extends existing literature on digital vulnerability, defined as a state in which people are at risk of harm due to external conditions and personal states and circumstances that significantly inhibit their agency in practices involving digital technologies. It reveals differentiated patterns of WST use and the role of identities and identity work in shaping WST use and users’ vulnerability to potential harms.",

          "authors": "Stuart Soroka, Georgia Kernell, P J Lamberson",
          "abstract": "Political polarization is often characterized as a consequence of changes in media content or technology. We argue, in contrast, for an account that views polarization in media and the public as a co-adaptive process. This paper begins with a brief review of cultural evolution and co-adaptation and then considers the application of similar ideas to changes in media and the public over time. Using formal models, we suggest that—in combination with the human tendency toward in-group bias—a co-adaptive (rather than unidirectional) relationship can best account for real-world dynamics. We consider the implications of these findings for our understanding of media effects and technological innovation in polarization, representative democracy, and mass-mediated communication more broadly.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: In recent decades, social media has become an integral part of adolescents’ daily life, reshaping peer interactions. To overcome the limitations of the quantitative approach of adolescents’ social media use when investigating relationships with psychological outcomes, motivational factors have become increasingly popular. The first aim was to review the psychometric properties of existent tools used to measure adolescents’ social media use motives. The second objective was to elaborate a classification of the main motives among adolescents. Following PRISMA guidelines, 14 articles were reviewed based on the search of 5 databases. Psychometric properties were examined based on the COSMIN guidelines. The reviewed articles showed a heterogeneous process, with only two of them considered as a satisfying procedure of development and validation. Based on the Use and Gratification Theory, a classification of the five main motives for adolescents’ social media use was developed. Overall, this study encourages the pursuit of studies on social media use among adolescence, while carefully choosing a tool with satisfying psychometric properties.",

          "abstract": "We investigated how mental contrasting, a self-regulation strategy, affects relationship problem-solving in 105 mixed-gender couples. Couples were assigned to a mental contrasting (juxtaposing the desired future with the main inner obstacle) or indulging (imagining only the desired future) condition. We reassessed problem resolution 2 weeks later. Actor-partner interdependence model analyses revealed that mental contrasting improved problem resolution over this period for problems perceived as important to resolve. Right after the intervention, we also recorded couples’ problem-solving behavior during a Zoom discussion among the partners. Men in the mental contrasting (vs. indulging) condition showed more self-disclosure, especially of feelings, attitudes, and behaviors. Women in the mental contrasting condition were more selective when suggesting solutions. Mental contrasting appears to foster problem-solving by enabling men to engage in self-disclosure, making women selective about solution suggestions, and enabling both women and men to effectively implement solutions, especially for high-importance problems.",

          "abstract": "Misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation pose a challenge to health risk communication. These information disorders can be amplified and altered by AI. In this article, we compare governance approaches from Germany and Brazil to understand how these two democracies address the role of AI in both exacerbating and mitigating health information disorders. Drawing on document analysis of hard and soft law governance approaches, the study shows that both countries frame AI as an ambivalent tool: While AI enables large-scale production and spread of misleading content, it also provides mechanisms for detection and monitoring of this content, and allows tailored communication. In Germany, information disorders are addressed through a multi-level governance strategy that combines national regulation with international frameworks. At the same time, independent fact-checking organizations and individual actors play a complementary role by monitoring public discourse, verifying claims, and fostering media literacy. In Brazil, efforts include legislative proposals on AI, the National AI Plan, and fact-checking services, though implementation is complicated by political and economic dynamics. Across both contexts, governance measures emphasize individual and organizational responsibilities, particularly through platform regulation, transparency, and digital literacy, but often underplay broader societal and interactional factors such as political structures, trust, and post-truth dynamics.",

          "authors": "Linnea Saltin",
          "abstract": "The re-emerging nature of virtual reality (VR) and recurring waves of hype have made this technology a conduit for imaginations of solving complex social and ecological problems. Recent iterations of VR, such as mobile VR and VR head mounted displays (HMDs) for casual users, have made it evident that the spatial relations of VR are multiple and complex. This article utilizes the Foucauldian concept of heterotopia to explore how spatilities of VR are imagined and practiced as counter-spaces in a digital landscape of smartphones and social media. Focusing on the heterotopia’s ability to provide a space for contesting and inverting the societies within which they exist, I show how VR is constantly juxtaposed against other technologies, digital places, and techno-embodiments in user imaginaries and practices. Through ethnographic materials on domestic VR usage collected in Swedish homes, I found that notions of VR as an “other” or different medium are laden with imaginings of VR technology bringing about a better society—a virtual utopia. These positive futures are paired with and derived from dystopic imaginaries and fictions. Recognizing the necessity to take media imaginaries and their inherent spatiality seriously, through how they are expressed and acted upon in the digital geographies of everyday life, I explore how VR users’ contesting ideas are deployed to make VR a hopeful other in a technological landscape. I conclude that conceptualizations that are slippery, self-contradicting, and do works as tricksters have much to offer digital geographies.",

          "abstract": "This article turns to cruising maps as sites in which normative conceptions of space, place, and time might be reimagined. The authors first examine a brief history of queer mapping practices, paying particular attention to how queer cruising maps challenge constructions of private and public life by charting veiled sexual publics obfuscated by subtle queer social codes. Then, paying particular attention to ephemera and affect, the authors investigate the ways these queer cruising maps are animated by economies of affective experiences and other queer ephemera—feelings, lingerings, barterings, passings, and potentialities. The authors then argue that such an affective experience reorients stabilized notions of space, place, and time. The article concludes with a meditation on the futures of cruising, reflecting on how queer social and sexual relations have been (re)shaped across time into the present moment. Through such a provocation, the authors seek to critically examine how queer sexual practices and counterpublics are mapped and remembered, and how their contours of belonging continue to be contested, opening potentials and possibilities for new queer futures.",

          "abstract": "Prior studies have established the importance of social capital in fostering disaster resilience especially among diverse and marginalised populations. Yet, most have focused on its structural dimension, treating social capital as a pre-existing attribute. Limited attention has been given to its communicative underpinning—how shared meaning-making, particularly through storytelling networks as open and participatory spaces, actively constitutes social capital. Addressing this gap, this study draws on storytelling networks theory and the notion of narrative agency to examine how community self-organised storytelling networks, comprising agents, stories, and practices, shape collective sensemaking as the foundation of social capital. Based on 36 in-depth interviews with community members, emergency practitioners, and service providers, the study reconceptualises social capital through a participatory storytelling lens and advances a critical understanding of narrative agency amid power asymmetries. It also offers practical insights into how diverse storytelling agents co-make social capital and outlines directions for future research.",

          "abstract": "As virtual reality (VR) evolves as a narrative medium, its capacity to immerse users in realistic environments has attracted scholarly interest. This study investigates how users perceive realism in VR beyond sensory fidelity. Using 27 interviews and four focus groups with experts and non-experts (n = 77), we examine how realism in VR is conceptualized and experienced. Qualitative analysis identified 12 factors contributing to perceived realism, grouped into five overarching dimensions: immersion, presence, embodiment, involvement and external realism. Our findings indicate that realism is shaped not only by technological features such as graphical quality but also by factors such as emotional involvement, narrative consistency and perceived authenticity. The study advances theorizing on perceived realism by proposing a framework that integrates technological and experiential dimensions and offers a basis for developing scales to measure realism in VR. Current findings are also relevant for the responsible use of VR in persuasive contexts.",

However, repetitive posting does not exclusively indicate automation; humans also engage in bot-like posting for various purposes. We adopt the term ‘botting’ to describe repetitive posting enacted through manual, semi-automated, or fully automated means. While emerging research has linked manual botting practices to commercial or fame-seeking motivations, we extend this scholarship by examining botting on Reddit – a pseudonymous platform that lacks the affordances typically associated with monetisation or personal branding. Through a mixed-methods analysis, we examine a case study in which mass-scale, repetitive posting of the mushroom emoji emerged as ‘in-group’ behaviour within Reddit’s participatory culture, prompting a performative counterpublic response. Our findings challenge the binary between human and automated posting, and underscore the importance of situating research on AI-generated and automated content within the cultural and contextual frameworks that shape its production and reception.",

This research builds upon the premise that carceral authority is exerted not only through speech itself but also erasure, which can decentralize the networked power of government spokespeople. This article importantly advances a method for procuring social media data by decentering corporate regimes of records management and focusing on the archival potential of the U.S. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) as a way of studying disconnective practices of the U.S. national security state. Drawing on a multimodal corpus of archived deleted tweets, internal administrative records, and a FOIA response letter, the article traces disconnection as a staged institutional process rather than a single act of withdrawal. This empirical approach garners an analysis of how the JTF-GTMO steadily attempted to sever much of its networked communication, initially through deletion of individually published messages and later through the total deactivation of its Twitter and Facebook accounts. The study ultimately contributes to ongoing research on national security, public memory, and platform power by proposing a counter-archival method that can be adapted across a number of jurisdictions.",

Drawing on qualitative interviews with theatre professionals in Norway and ethnographic observations in Oslo, London and New York, the study demonstrates how social norms surrounding smartphone use are negotiated in different cultural contexts. The analysis highlights key tensions and dilemmas: audiences balance personal documentation with collective immersion, managers weigh promotional visibility against aesthetic disruption and performers experience interruptions that alter the sensory and affective dynamics of liveness. Extending Fischer-Lichte’s concept of the autopoietic feedback loop, the article proposes the concept of a ‘hybrid feedback loop’, in which audience responses circulate simultaneously through embodied co-presence and digitally mediated attention. This theoretical reframing captures how digital devices reconfigure the ecology of performance, reshaping how liveness is produced, perceived and policed in contemporary cultural institutions.",

This study explores users’ conceptualization of gamification, its impact on experiences, and dating scripts. Thirty-one semi-structured interviews (17 cisgender women, 14 cisgender men) were conducted in Portugal. Participants were current and former users with different sexual orientations and a diverse age range (18–34 years old), and predominantly Portuguese. The thematic analysis presented how users likened their dating app interactions to games, identifying specific gamified features, and describing their adaptation and engagement in strategic practices to enhance appeal. Despite the uniform platform system and rules, traditional gender scripts endure and dictate a binary dynamic where men are seen as initiators and women as selectors. The findings reveal tensions between gamification’s homogenizing effect and enduring socio-cultural scripts, illustrating how platform design affordances and social norms structure dating experiences.",

          "abstract": "We examine a year of political debate in a modern town hall to understand the following: when does moral talk turn to talk about action? For which ideological groupings do specific moral foundations matter and in the context of which issues? We analysed 210,170 tweets about the Australian television programme Q&amp;A – a panel show with synchronous live and online audiences. We examined the topics, prevalence of different moralities and how these moralities explain talk of collective action for different ideological groups. Across all issues and ideological groups, talk of action was most often associated with talk of authority but ideological differences between left- and right-leaning participants emerged. Among left-leaning people, action was motivated by a range of moral foundations, but among right-leaning people action was primarily motivated by authority. Our findings map the ideological diversity found within modern town halls and confirm the critical role of these settings in contemporary socio-political life.",

          "authors": "Weiman Chen, Zhouyi Yao, Huilin Tan",
          "abstract": "In the digital age, philanthropy is increasingly mediated by platform microcelebrities who mobilize audiences for social good. This study examines the novel philanthropic model of YouTube creator Jimmy Donaldson as a case of outsourced activism , characterized by a dual-outsourcing structure: audiences transfer charitable intent and contributions (via attention-as-currency) to Donaldson, who acts as a central agent and then outsources execution to NGOs and collaborators. Using a mixed-methods design combining a walkthrough, multimodal discourse analysis of 101 videos, and topic modeling of 11,208 comments, we demonstrate how sentimental and digital spectacles sustain this process as tools for activism. The mechanism forms a new connective practice, creating a network of moral delegation and affective investment among audiences, creators, sponsors, and NGOs. Yet, it raises ethical concerns, including depoliticizing social issues and reinforcing unequal power relations. The study advances theories of media activism, connective action, and digital philanthropy by identifying a replicable logic that redefines agency, accountability, and civic participation in platform societies.",

          "abstract": "This study reframes late-night smartphone use among Chinese young adults beyond pathologizing it as self-regulation failure. Integrating self-determination theory with social acceleration theory, we conceptualize this behavior as a strategic temporal negotiation to reclaim personal time. Structural equation modeling (n = 503) reveals that perceived leisure freedom and leisure satisfaction primarily drive behavioral intention, while perceived short-term risk deters it. Perceived long-term risk and guilt show no significant impact on intention. Perceived time constraint intensifies actual behavior, while social control paradoxically reinforces rather than limits it. Although self-control significantly reduces behavioral enactment, it cannot eliminate underlying motivational drivers. These findings reveal a tripartite negotiation: leisure benefits versus health risks, pleasure versus guilt, and personal autonomy versus social order. We theorize this as “strategic connected deceleration”—an adaptive response whereby individuals use technology to secure autonomous time amid systemic acceleration. Interventions should address structural time pressure rather than exclusively targeting individual discipline.",

          "abstract": "While GIFs (Graphics Interchange Format) have been studied as digital communication tools, their repositories – these databases of visual expressions – remain largely unexamined as sites that generate emotional expressions across different modes of communication. This research introduces the concept of “emotional transcoding,” examining how it operates in major repositories Giphy and Tenor through the conversion of paralinguistic vocal expressions – auditory reactions like “aww,” “duh,” and “wow” – into visual representations within silent GIF formats. Through multimodal analysis, this study documents the semiotic strategies involved in emotional transcoding, revealing systematic patterns for visually encoding auditory emotional expressions. Using qualitative content analysis of 1000 GIFs, this study identifies the visual techniques used in cross-modal conversion and analyzes the demographic patterns among performers who represent these expressions. The findings reveal how emotional transcoding operates through specific representational conventions and highlight questions about whose bodies become available as vehicles for emotional communication in digital platforms.",

          "authors": "Jeewon Oh, Arina Stoianova, Tara Marie Bello, Ashley De La Cruz",
          "abstract": "We examined whether individual differences related to a sense of choice in being single—ranging from broad psychological needs to contextualized relationship motivations—explain variability in single people's well‐being. In a sample of 445 single adults ( M age = 52.91, Msinglehood = 20.43 years) recruited from Qualtrics, we tested whether basic need satisfaction, attachment orientation, sociosexuality, and reasons for being single (low capacity for courtship, freedom, previous constraints, and personal constraints) were associated with well‐being. Results for need satisfaction and attachment replicated in a pooled sample, including 545 younger singles ( M age = 18.87, Msinglehood = 7.87 years) from a university subject pool. Satisfying basic needs was consistently linked to greater life satisfaction, singlehood satisfaction, and fewer depressive symptoms; attachment anxiety predicted more depressive symptoms and lower singlehood satisfaction (the latter in the pooled sample). Sociosexuality did not predict outcomes beyond basic need satisfaction and attachment. Valuing personal freedom predicted higher satisfaction, whereas perceiving constraints from previous relationships predicted greater depressive symptoms. These findings demonstrate that individual differences related to choice at different levels of specificity provide incremental validity: one who generally feels autonomous may still benefit from secure attachment and valuing their singlehood. Findings underscore integrating general and contextualized predictors to understand single people's well‐being.",

          "authors": "Qurban Hussain Pamirzad, Qiang Chen",
          "abstract": "The dissemination of weaponized information—defined as the intentional use of falsehoods (i.e. disinformation) and the harmful misuse of accurate information (i.e. malinformation) against a target—on social media represents a notable downside of these platforms, often linked to polarization. However, research on the relationship between weaponized information and polarization remains limited due to conceptual ambiguities and geographical context. This study uses cross-sectional survey data ( N = 520) collected across eight provinces in Afghanistan to explore the direct and indirect association between exposure to disinformation and malinformation online and ethnic polarization. Findings through mediation analyses reveal that exposure to disinformation was not associated with ethnic polarization, either directly or indirectly. Conversely, exposure to malinformation was directly associated with ethnic polarization and indirectly linked to it through increased ingroup positive perception. These findings highlight the nuanced difference in how intentional falsehoods and the harmful misuse of accurate information shape polarization dynamics in ethnically diverse and polarized societies.",

          "authors": "Ozan Aşık, Matthew Powers",
          "abstract": "This article examines how professional ethics can paradoxically suppress critical journalism under authoritarian conditions. Drawing on fieldwork and interviews conducted in Turkish newsrooms, we show how journalists navigate ethical commitments amid state control. Using Weber’s “ethic of responsibility” and “ethic of conviction,” we find that editors routinely suppress reporting to protect their newsrooms and carve out a reduced space for critical coverage, while some reporters prioritize truth-telling but disclaim responsibility for publication outcomes. These orientations reinforce a division of labor that perpetuates suppression, showing that ethics can sometimes be used to legitimize restraint rather than resist authoritarianism.",
