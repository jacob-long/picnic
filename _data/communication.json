          "abstract": "In this article, we propose a theoretical reconceptualization of the hybrid media system model by introducing structural and material conditions of contemporary media sphere with reference to critical theory. Our main thesis is based on the principle of historicization and the concept of social relations. Using this framework, we demonstrate that those who wield dominant power within the neoliberal capitalist economy also have influence over the logic of the hybrid media system. Following the premise that the “agency” is constrained by hierarchical social relations, we enhance the hybrid media system model to explicate not only cases where digital media have enabled successful civic activism leading to social change but also cases where newer digital technologies reinforce pre-existing social relations of power and subordination. The main contribution of the article is to show that critical theory strengthens the explanatory power of the current eclectic-empirical media models without fundamentally undermining their foundations.",

          "abstract": "Research on motivations for news consumption has primarily focused on uses and gratifications (U&amp;G) from both conventional and new media. However, there is a gap regarding age perspectives in this field. This study aims to address this gap by examining whether differences and similarities exist in the motivations for news consumption among the citizens of 23 European countries. Analyzing data from 45,073 respondents, the study finds significant variations in motivation across age groups, particularly in informational, learning, entertaining, and social gratifications. Interestingly, there are no age-based differences in motivation driven by civic duties. Furthermore, the study shows that country differences do not significantly influence the relationship between age and motivation. The results add valuable insights into both academics and practitioners in the field of news of consumption and expand knowledge of the current literature.",

          "abstract": "The “Cozy” game has gained traction as a concept in contemporary game culture as a set of formal generic features. While we examine the way that Cozy Games are often now defined as a genre, we demonstrate that “coziness in games” has widespread formal and engagement functions and can be experienced in a whole range of games, not simply those defined by the Cozy genre. In focusing on the player–text relationship, and in using a literary model, we seek to widen the discourse and range of meanings of coziness in, as well as of, games. This approach enables us to think about our own lived experience of playing games in terms of the generation of affect, as well as opening the way for renewed analysis of representation, ideology, and cognition.",

          "authors": "Rayenda Khresna Brahmana, Maria Kontesa",
          "abstract": "Purpose This research aims to examine how financial literacy moderates the mediation of attitude toward virtual influencers’ non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or ATB on the relationship between purchase intention and self-congruity, which includes symbolic representation, self-image congruence and emotional value. Initially, we investigated the mediation effect of ATB on the relationship between self-congruity and purchase intention. Subsequently, we analyze how financial literacy moderates this mediation process. Design/methodology/approach The study employed a sample of 383 virtual influencers’ fans and applied a partial least square structural equation model (PLS-SEM) along with robustness tests to test the research hypothesis. The analysis is based on the moderated mediation framework. Findings The findings are intriguing for several reasons. First, it reveals that only self-image congruence positively affects purchase intention, contrary to existing self-congruity theory literature. The relationship between self-image congruence and purchase intention is a direct relationship with no mediation effect of ATB. Second, ATB fails to mediate the self-congruity effect on purchase intention. Third, financial literacy has a negative relationship with purchase intention, indicating that fans of virtual influencers with higher financial literacy are less likely to purchase virtual influencers’ NFTs due to more critical investment evaluations. We also argue that financial literacy discards the consumption behavior effect from self-congruity variables on purchase intention. Research limitations/implications The study contributes to the literature by emphasizing the significance of financial literacy on purchase intention under the self-congruity framework. It also surmises that self-image congruence does matter for the purchase intention of a virtual influencer’s NFT. However, further research could validate findings by studying broader NFT investors, incorporating fandom and impulse buying variables and examining actual NFT purchases against planned behavior. Practical implications This research is crucial for virtual influencers’ NFT creators, marketers and fans by providing insights for evaluating virtual influencers’ creators’ decision to pursue NFT markets. The findings reveal that the creators of virtual influencers should reconsider pursuing the NFT market, as self-congruity may not be a driving factor. Notably, our findings imply that a virtual influencer’s NFT is significantly different from a virtual influencer's merchandising business. Originality/value The originality of this study lies in extending the self-congruity within the NFT context, investigating how financial literacy moderates the mediation of ATB on the self-congruity-purchase intention relationship. It challenges self-congruity theory by showing that despite fans feeling aligned with virtual influencers, high financial literacy reduces the congruence.",

          "abstract": "Purpose As the use of AI techniques becomes more prevalent in evaluation activities, researchers have suggested integrating AI and human evaluators to address potential AI aversions from applicants. This study was conducted in response to this call, utilizing a Chinese sample. Design/methodology/approach This study examined applicants’ responses to decisions made by a human–AI hybrid jury with varying levels of AI agency. Using a three (AI agency: low, medium and high) × 2 (outcome favorability: favorable and unfavorable) between-subjects design, we analyzed the moderated mediation relationship between machine heuristics and organizational assessment, with fairness perceptions serving as a mediator and AI agency level and outcome favorability as moderating variables. Findings The results revealed that positive machine heuristics enhanced fairness perception only at high AI agency levels, irrespective of outcome favorability. Negative machine heuristics impaired fairness perception at medium or high AI agency levels only in cases where participants failed the test. Machine heuristics did not directly influence participants’ assessment of the organization but could indirectly influence organization assessments through fairness perception, contingent on the composition of AI agency level and outcome favorability. Originality/value By having participants go through a real intelligence exam and explore their experiences, this study had theoretical and practical implications for AI evaluation.",

          "authors": "Qianling Jiang, Jue Qian, Yong Zang",
          "abstract": "Purpose In today’s world, there’s a growing recognition of the importance of cultural heritage. Mobile games have emerged as a powerful medium for the dissemination of culture. However, there’s a noticeable gap in the existing research concerning the cultural experiences within games and how they contribute to the development of cultural identity. This study addresses this gap by developing a scale to evaluate cultural experiences and constructing a theoretical model of cultural identity. By focusing on the popular mobile game “王者荣耀” (King of Glory), we highlight its rich representation of intangible cultural heritage elements and its influence on players' cultural identity. By doing so, it seeks to provide valuable insights and guidance for the development and design of mobile games. Design/methodology/approach To achieve its objectives, this study employs a combination of user interviews, factor analysis and structural equation modeling. These methods are used to identify four key dimensions of cultural experience and explore the intricate relationships between various influencing factors and the formation of cultural identity. Findings The concept of cultural experience within games encompasses four distinct facets: emotional connection, design aesthetics, perceived playfulness and knowledge acquisition. Aesthetic appreciation notably influences emotional connection and the overall enjoyment of the game. Furthermore, emotional connection plays a pivotal role in facilitating users' acquisition of knowledge. Additionally, users' cultural heritage values positively impact emotional connection, aesthetic appreciation, emotional attachment and, ultimately, their cultural identity. Within game-based cultural experiences, emotional connection and knowledge acquisition emerge as central elements that significantly influence users' sense of cultural identity. Originality/value The originality of this study lies in its pioneering construction of a comprehensive framework for assessing the impact of cultural experiences within mobile games on cultural identity. By examining “王者荣耀,” this study bridges the gap between intangible cultural heritage and interactive digital media, making an original and significant contribution to both fields.",

          "authors": "Amon Simba, Mahdi Tajeddin, Paul Jones, Patient Rambe",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study analyzes technostress in African entrepreneurship. It advances contextualized theoretical explanations of technostress depicting its impact on entrepreneurs who excessively consume digital technology in Africa. The study also describes how research linking transactional benefits to digital technology has created an imbalanced literature that ignores technostress and well-being in African entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach Considering the study’s theoretical explanations derived at the technostress–entrepreneurship–well-being nexus, structural equation modeling (SEM) was deemed appropriate. Unlike qualitative–based methods, SEM experiments on 643 observations of early–stage African entrepreneurs in South Africa enabled robust statistical interpretations of their social settings. Thus, strengthening our analysis and focus on the interplay between the variables of technostress, including overload, invasion, complexity and uncertainty, and their impact on entrepreneurship intentions defined through perceived behavior control, entrepreneurship passion and digital self-efficacy. Findings SEM experiments on these African entrepreneurs revealed technostress dimensions of overload, invasion, complexity and uncertainty as moderators of their entrepreneurial actions encompassing perceived behaviour control and entrepreneurship passion in connection with their entrepreneurial intentions. The results also suggested that perceived behaviour control, entrepreneurship passion, and the digital self-efficacy of these entrepreneurs influenced their entrepreneurial intentions. Research limitations/implications Besides inspiring more studies on technostress and well-being in varied entrepreneurial contexts, this research also initiates debate on policy and social reforms geared toward entrepreneurs considered vulnerable to excessive digital technology consumption. Originality/value The novelty of this study lies in its theoretical explanations derived at the technostress–entrepreneurship–well-being nexus. This conceptual overlay elevates the interpretations of the findings of this study beyond the averages in entrepreneurship and information technology (IT) research. Specifically, it increases their inferential value by revealing subtle and hard to dictate social interactions inherent in how African entrepreneurs consume and are impacted by technology as they pursue their entrepreneurial endeavors.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to investigate the use of social media platforms compared to IT-enabled communication in the context of dispersed teams. Design/methodology/approach We draw on the millefeuille theory to develop a model that examines the impact of multiple media use (namely the millefeuille effect) on team performance. Data were collected from 70 dispersed teams. Findings We showed dispersed teams are more likely to improve their performance when relying on diverse media, including social media platforms and other IT-enabled communication. We provide empirical evidence that the millefeuille effect does not necessarily impede performance. Originality/value An increasing number of companies are implementing social media platforms as part of their media portfolio in addition to the already existing IT-enabled communication, such as email. However, we lack understanding of how the use of different media impacts team performance. Drawing on the millefeuille theory, this study investigates the use of social media platforms in dispersed teams by examining how their use with other IT-enabled communication can lead to team performance. This research introduces and differentiates two measures of the millefeuille effect to explain the different impacts of the millefeuille effect: millefeuille size (the number of non-overlapping media used) and millefeuille diversity (the variety of media used).",

          "abstract": "Purpose Addressing users’ migration is a prerequisite for the sustainable development of the sharing economy. Ethical concerns that may lead to users’ migration are frequent in sharing economy platforms. Therefore, this study explores whether the long-term governance of sharing economy platforms can effectively mitigate users’ migration caused by ethical concerns. Design/methodology/approach Using a questionnaire survey of 549 participants, this study investigated the mechanism of users’ migration and governance strategies in the platform ecosystem based on trust theory. Findings The results indicate that users’ ethical concerns regarding the platform ecosystem significantly and positively influence their migration. Furthermore, users’ continued trust played a significant mediating role in the relationship between ethical concerns and users’ migration. The results also showed that future orientation and resilience significantly moderated the impact of users’ ethical concerns on their continued trust, thereby weakening this effect. Practical implications The author clarified the relationship between ethical concerns and users’ migration, identified the underlying mechanisms and provided guidance on how to mitigate migration behavior. However, users’ migration is influenced by various factors beyond ethical concerns. In addition to some factors that lead to migration, other factors make users stay on the platform. Future research should integrate multiple factors. Originality/value This study reveals the mechanism of action between users’ migration and ethical concerns in the platform ecosystem and sheds light on the output of long-term orientation practices of the platform.",

          "authors": "Yongjin Hwang, Keshav Gupta, Deokkyung Ock",
          "abstract": "Purpose Esports game developers are incorporating interactive virtual shopping (IVS) experiences into their products to facilitate consumer–brand interactions. Despite the potential influence of IVS, existing research lacks an understanding of its impact on consumers’ overall affect– particularly game enjoyment, a critical factor in sustaining engagement with esports products – and on attitudinal change toward brands in the real world. Design/methodology/approach An experiment was designed to examine the impact of shopping in the virtually interactive esports marketplace on game enjoyment. Mediating effects of positive change in brand attitude, perceived realism and character attachment and the moderating effect of self-avatar gender congruity were investigated using SPSS PROCESS Macro. Additionally, the impact of brand popularity on the relationship between IVS and brand attitude was examined using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Findings There was a positive impact of IVS on game enjoyment, mediated by a positive change in brand attitude, perceived realism and character attachment. Self-avatar gender congruity moderated the mediation effect of perceived realism. Notably, less popular brands exhibited a greater change in brand attitude compared to more popular brands. Originality/value The findings add to the body of literature on esports, particularly in investigating the role of IVS within the esports virtual world and advancing research on cognitive appraisal theory. This study informs practitioners in the esports industry about the value of creating interactive virtual marketplaces, as they serve to benefit sponsoring brands and enhance game enjoyment for players.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Gamification has been widely applied in mobile fitness apps to motivate users to exercise continuously. Based on the affordances–psychological outcomes–behavioral outcomes framework, this study explores the roles of three specific gamification affordances (competition, visibility of achievement and interactivity) in self-health management (continuous use behavior and health behavior) from the perspectives of achievement satisfaction and gamification exhaustion. Design/methodology/approach We test the research model using a structural equation model (SEM) with 505 self-reported data points. Furthermore, we apply fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to explore configurations of gamification affordances associated with self-health management behavior, reinforcing the SEM results. Findings Results indicate that competition, visibility of achievement and interactivity can enhance achievement satisfaction, which further boosts self-health management behavior. However, competition and interactivity can also cause gamification exhaustion, which undermines self-health management behavior to some extent. Overall, the positive impacts of the three affordances outweigh the negative impacts. Practical implications This study provides new insights for relevant practitioners on designing gamification affordances, aiding the sustainable development of mobile fitness apps and their long-term effects on self-health management. Visibility of achievement should be emphasized, and competition and interactivity should be thoughtfully designed to minimize their negative effects. Originality/value This study extends the affordances–psychological outcomes–behavioral outcomes framework and the literature on gamification and health management by applying both SEM and fsQCA methodologies to examine the relationship between specific gamification affordances and self-health management behavior.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study investigated how Generation Z adopted brand messages through trending topics and analysed the central and peripheral routes of information adoption. It explored the roles of informational and emotional supports in influencing information adoption through perceived information usefulness and considered the adoption of brand messages within trending topic discussions. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on the extension information adoption model, this study employed a quantitative approach by utilising covariance-based structural equation modelling to analyse 400 valid web-based questionnaire responses from Sina Microblog users among Generation Z in China. Findings Adopting brand messages via trending topics, with cues emphasising information quality as the central route and information credibility as the peripheral route, enhances perceived information usefulness. Notably, Generation Z can derive informational and emotional support from trending topic discussions, influencing their perceived information usefulness. This process operates independently of the dual routes of information adoption. Research limitations/implications Marketers can leverage influencers and users’ comments to motivate Generation Z to adopt brand messages through trending topics, but this study was limited by the demographic diversity of its sample and the specific types of brands analysed. Incorporating cross-cultural comparisons, group analyses, potential moderating factors and control variables could improve the model’s generalisability. Originality/value Compared to information adoption models rooted in the organisational information exchange, the originality of this study lies in confirming that, within the context of trending topics, which blend social connections with an anonymous environment, informational and emotional supports can serve as additional cues influencing brand information adoption via perceived information usefulness.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Although prior research has employed various variables to predict player churn, the dynamic evolution of the behavioral patterns of players has received limited attention. In this study, churn prediction models are developed by incorporating the progress level, in-game purchase, social interaction, behavioral pattern and behavioral variability (BV) of players in social casino games (SCGs). The study distinguishes churn prediction between two player groups: monetizers and non-monetizers. Design/methodology/approach This study employs three machine learning techniques—logistic regression, decision trees and random forests—using real-world player data from an SCG company to construct churn prediction models. Two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, BV was combined with four other variable categories to effectively predict churn behaviors across all players ( n  = 52,246). In Experiment 2, churn prediction models were developed separately for monetizers ( n  = 16,628) and non-monetizers ( n  = 35,618). Findings The findings from Experiment 1 indicate that incorporating BV significantly improves the overall performance of churn prediction models. Experiment 2 demonstrates that churn prediction models achieve better performance and predictive accuracy for monetizers and non-monetizers when BV is calculated over the 3-day to 7-day and 7-day to 14-day windows, respectively. Originality/value This study introduces BV as a novel variable category for churn prediction, emphasizing within-person variability and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing model performance. Churn prediction models were independently constructed for monetizers and non-monetizers, utilizing different time windows for variable extraction. This approach improves predictive performance and highlights key differences in critical variables influencing churn across the two player groups. The findings provide valuable insights into churn management strategies tailored for monetizers and non-monetizers.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Growing technology adoption is a significant opportunity for the growth of the mobile gaming market. Rising smartphones allow game developers to reach more players and make more money. The study offers guidance for mobile game developers to increase profits and extend the longevity of their games. It aims to assist in making better marketing policy decisions by providing valuable insights into effective approaches for both early and subsequent market penetration stages. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a model for analyzing factors that influence the attraction and retention of mobile gamers, which is based on a literature review of mobile gaming and uses the Bass diffusion model and system dynamics method for modeling and simulation. Findings In the initial stages of a game release, influencer marketing can be more effective than other marketing tools in increasing visibility. As the game progresses, incorporating referral programs can enhance user engagement, promote the game further, and reduce the number of uninstalls. Influencer marketing can also help the games reach a wider audience, generating more interest, and increasing installations for more tremendous success in the market. However, referral programs can extend the lifespan of games, mainly when gamers are engaged. Originality/value The study used new marketing strategies in the mobile game industry to gain insights into the growth and evolution of this industry. Development managers can use insights for effective policies and success. The model aids in understanding the dynamics of mobile games and informed decisions for game developers.",

          "abstract": "Loneliness is a complex and multifaceted experience resulting from a person’s subjective assessment of the gap between their desired and actual social connections. This study presents an analysis of prevalence rates and correlates of loneliness amongst Maltese individuals aged 11 years and older ( n = 658). Data collected in 2022 allowed for a follow up on a first ever study investigating loneliness in Malta in 2019 ( n = 1,009) and makes comparisons to understand how loneliness prevalence rates have changed over time and in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results show that in 2022, 54.6% of the sample reported some degree of loneliness. The sociodemographic characteristics that were significantly associated with the highest levels of loneliness were age (11–19 years and 55+), lower levels of education, being widowed, retired, low household income, decreased sense of neighborhood belonging, poor general health, poor coping abilities and not feeling positive about life. Compared to 2019, mean overall loneliness scores were significantly higher in 2022. The most marked increases were observed amongst the youngest groups (11–19 years and 20–34 years), those with the lowest and the highest educational levels, those with a weaker sense of neighborhood belonging and those with poorer coping abilities. The paper makes some recommendations for further research, policy and practice in view of the findings.",

          "abstract": "Adopting feminist and intersectional perspectives, this study focused on gendered experiences in financial communication, power dynamics, and social sabotage across lower- versus higher-income couples. Three-wave, dyadic data were collected from 1,093 married couples between 2020 and 2022, covering the period before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Employing a random-intercept, actor-partner interdependence cross-lagged panel model (i.e., RI-APIM-CLPM), this study was among the initial ones to investigate bidirectional, longitudinal associations among financial communication, power dynamics, and social sabotage. Across high- and low-income couples, bidirectional associations emerged between financial communication and social sabotage. Yet it was unexpected that financial communication problems and the experiences of being socially sabotaged seem to have depleted (vs. reinforced) each other for wives in the higher-income group. Unidirectional associations emerged such that financial communication predicted power (im)balance in high-income couples. Unidirectional associations emerged among low-income couples such that power (im)balance predicted financial communication problems and social sabotage. Our findings collectively suggested a spiral of financial communication problems, power inequity, and social sabotage. Our findings also demonstrated that wives in higher- and lower-income couples faced challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, though these challenges manifested in distinct forms. Thus, we remind practitioners and researchers of the necessity of considering the unique needs of men and women across different income statuses when addressing issues of financial communication problems, inequitable power, and social sabotage.",

Addressing this gap, we conducted 31 interviews with Dutch MPs. Our findings reveal that while MPs recognize the media’s impact on the political realm and fellow politicians, their own adaptation to the media’s preference for negativity and conflict is a strategic and deliberate choice.",

The article builds its argument on theories of transmediality and hybridization in digital media ecosystems and the socio-psychological development toward accountable communication and responsible professionalism. It specifically looks at future journalists as active learners to whom media literacy interventions may offer new insights into the mental processes in professional decision-making. It tests these ideas in an experimental study with journalism students, where the lateral reading approach was applied within the framework of learning skills for information verification. Results from the thematic analysis of students’ reflexive assessments of their practice reveal norms illustrative of a self-efficacious learning process: Students’ answers demonstrate empowering and perseverance-directed approaches. As argued, these norms are geared toward imposing a higher media awareness and self-regulatory capacity, which is critical for accountable decision-making in transmedial and highly interactive digital information environments.",

          "abstract": "To this day, people still face gender discrimination and battle with gender injustices. To change this, we both need accurate knowledge about these injustices and we need to strive for active change. This article provides a theoretical reflection on how social media, by serving as an accessible platform for people to portray their emotions, can be a tool for both of these needs. In terms of the topics it discusses, the article operates at the intersection of the literature on digital activism on the one hand and emotions and social media on the other. However, I approach these topics using a combination of multidisciplinary lenses. I employ the epistemic injustice framework to emphasise the link between gender inequality and the production and distribution of knowledge. In line with the literature on affect theory, I argue both that emotions can generate epistemic novelties and that emotions have collectivising and motivational power. Finally, the article builds on existing research on how social media provide a space for people to portray, distribute, and adopt emotions. The theoretical reflection in this article then combines these insights to demonstrate how social media—by allowing the expression and distribution of emotions—can catalyse both the production of new knowledge and active change. With social media enabling emotions to be heard and seen, this online sphere can contribute to the epistemic empowerment of women and to the fight against gender discrimination and gender injustices.",

Podcast coverage of sports has adapted by enhancing a focus on the political implications of athletes' personal stories. Analysis of episodic content and interview correspondence with podcast hosts focuses on how the podcast medium has opened new spaces advancing the cultural discourse on how issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion impact athletes' lives. Affordances unique to the podcast medium have enabled the expansion of journalistic roles to include advocacy functions and leaning toward more socially progressive content than traditional media coverage has allowed. &lt;/p&gt;",

We address this question by examining inequalities related to online job search skills and the outcomes of the online search process. Results from a representative survey of 1103 Spanish jobseekers show that online job search skills positively affect the chances of getting an interview through employment platforms but that they are unevenly distributed. Online job search skills are more important than other digital resources, including basic digital skills, in determining positive outcomes of online job searches though there are still inequalities in getting an interview independent of either.

We develop a relational analysis of datafication, deploying an infrastructural perspective and drawing on affect theory to develop the concept of data disaffection, which we define as the structural cultivation of accepting data accumulation as inevitable. Data disaffection is a structure of feeling that conditions processes across scales of analysis: it manifests in resignation and cynicism on an individual level while simultaneously structuring commercial practices. We illustrate how data disaffection highlights alternative sites and methods for understanding datafication, and we conclude by discussing the implications for understanding datafication as a cultural dynamic as well as a corporate practice.",

          "abstract": "To discover the means of persuasion available to experts who embrace the responsibility of public communication in times of crisis, this study uses a text/countertext method of rhetorical analysis on U.S. newspaper editorials by scientists writing about COVID-19 policy. Model arguments to opposition audiences on pandemic restrictions and vaccine policy were selected for close reading. We examined how writers in a pro-con debate in a centrist newspaper appealed mainly to like-minded readers, failing to make arguments designed to change the opinions of those who did not already agree with them. The lack of rhetorical sensitivity in these editorials suggests a need for scientists to better utilize existing resources of language and argument when addressing opposition audiences. Exemplary editorials to opposition audiences in right-leaning and left-leaning newspapers were then examined to illustrate more promising strategies of public persuasion in highly partisan times.",

          "authors": "Jimmy Ochieng, Maria Elizabeth Grabe, Kioko Ireri, Kevin C. Mudavadi",
          "abstract": "While Africans are committed to democracy, governments across the continent have failed to deliver on the democratic aspirations of the populace, with declinatory outcomes for satisfaction with democracy (SWD) over the past decade. A number of reliable variables (e.g., economics, political participation, democratic performance) have been used over the past 50 years to study trends in SWD worldwide. Yet the integrity of information ecosystems, including misinformation and censorship levels have not been fully explored as predictors of SWD. As concerns about the social web’s diffusion of misinformation have culminated in policy considerations worldwide, we focused on the African continent, where the current global push for government action to curb the misinformation tide could facilitate backsliding into authoritarian practices. Using a data set of 40,801 respondents from 34 African countries, we found that social media news use and perceptions about the circulation of misinformation impacted SWD and that citizen attitudes about government censorship of misinformation have a moderating influence on SWD.",

          "authors": "Simge Andı, Ali Çarkoğlu, Lemi Baruh, Zsofia Bocskay",
          "abstract": "Misinformation poses a significant threat to the integrity of political systems, particularly in competitive authoritarian regimes (CARs), where it can distort public perception and undermine democratic processes. This study focuses on the 2023 Turkish general elections—a context characterized by widespread misinformation. While extensive research has been conducted on misinformation in democratic systems, where press freedom and digitalization foster a mix of reliable and misleading information, this investigation targets the unique challenges and media consumption patterns in CARs. Utilizing a nationally representative survey after the 2023 elections, we examine the association between media consumption (traditional and online) and susceptibility to misinformation among government and opposition voters. Our findings reveal that partisan news consumption significantly influences belief in misinformation, with individuals tending to believe claims aligning with their political affiliations while rejecting opposing claims. Moreover, television remains a dominant source of information in Turkey, unlike social media, which shows a limited impact on misinformation beliefs but possesses a conditional corrective potential for certain electorate segments. This study underscores the enduring influence of traditional media in CARs and suggests that while the theory of selective exposure and partisanship is applicable, the constrained information environment significantly shapes public perceptions and misinformation dynamics.",
