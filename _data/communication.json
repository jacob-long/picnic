          "abstract": "We develop an integrative conceptual framework and research agenda for studying epistemic authorities in the digital age. Consulting epistemic authorities (e.g., professional experts, well-informed laypeople, technologies) can be an efficient fast-track to knowledge. To fulfill this functional role, those who claim epistemic authority need to be both subjectively recognized (have a perceived advantage in knowledge) and objectively justified (have an actual advantage in knowledge). In a digital media context, new and unconventional knowledge sources have emerged that can fulfill the functional role of epistemic authorities. But false authorities that disseminate misinformation have emerged as well while other sources with important knowledge remain unrecognized. We further analyze the functional role of epistemic intermediaries that can mitigate such problematic developments by correcting false authorities and by providing endorsement for unrecognized authorities. We conclude with a research agenda to study functional forms of epistemic authorities and epistemic intermediaries in the digital public sphere.",

          "authors": "Carolina Are, Catherine Talbot, Pam Briggs",
          "abstract": "Faced with offline discrimination, LGBTQIA+ users frequently turn to social media to find role models, build social networks and test out new forms of self-expression. Each platform has its own affordances and governance processes which can, in turn, facilitate or impede self-expression and community growth. Through a survey of 120 LGBTQIA+ participants, this paper considers which social media affordances facilitate the creation and development of LGBTQIA+ identities, support online and offline community formation and peer-to-peer learning, whilst limiting opportunities for online abuse. While previous research has so far largely focused on younger LGBTQIA+ users' experiences on SM, we found that broadening our sample to include older participants can lead to novel reflections on platforms' potential and/or challenges towards expressing one’s queerness online. For example, while users young and old found the visibility of other LGBTQIA+ accounts inspiring, entertaining and reassuring, particularly within previously stigmatised expressions of bisexuality, we found that older participants preferred to be selective about their outness, or sometimes to not be out at all, not simply for fear of harassment or context collapse, but also because of historical factors around family and friend relationships or because their identity experimentation had already happened offline. We also identified contrasting views about outness and the use and visibility of pronouns, reminding us that the online LGBTQIA+ community is not a monolith in its beliefs and practices, particularly when different life stages are considered.",

          "abstract": "This article advocates for a reevaluation of the thief class as a bridge linking literary narratives and tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs). It traces the roots of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D) thief class in Picaresque Literature against the wider importance of literature in the early TRGP scene, by comparing the thief class to the Picaresque rogue. Through a thematic analysis of articles from eight key TRPG periodicals published between 1975 and 1986, the article illustrates how “extensibility mechanisms” facilitated creative exchanges between hobbyist game designers, Fantasy fiction, and Picaresque Literature via the rogue archetype. These exchanges demonstrate a turn towards nuanced narrative-supporting mechanics, complex player character development, and including vibrant fantasy cities as settings for adventures in D&amp;D, and TRPGs more broadly, influenced by Picaresque Literature.",

We conducted a qualitative close-reading analysis of queer representation in the AAA historical-fiction series Assassin's Creed and the historical antecedents thereof to explore (a) the traditional marginalization of queer-identifying folks in (b) the context of growing societal acceptance within the (inter)national zeitgeist. In our examination of the developer's reaction operationalized as observable shifts in developers’ design choices, we observed an increase in representation that aligns with the shift in social attitudes toward queer folks over the last 15 years. With respect to the historical antecedents, we discovered a misalignment between the in-game portrayal of queer folks and acceptance thereof vis a vis the available historical record.",

In the past decade, these discussions have extended beyond academia to the broader gaming community, where certain genres have been elevated as “real games.” Genres like walking simulators, dating sims, visual novels, and hybrid forms are often at the center of these debates. , criticized for their simplicity, lack of challenge, or sometimes overtly sexual content. Despite this, the popularity of these genres is undeniable: since 2007, over 50,000 titles have been documented on the Visual Novel Database, and thousands of walking simulators are available on Steam and other platforms. Many of these titles also appear on MobyGames and have been referenced as “games” throughout history. In this article, we delve into this vast and often overlooked corpus to examine the qualities that can elevate gameplay to unreal levels.",

          "authors": "Mengtian Xiao, Yingqing Xu, Qijie Xiao",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to enhance the understanding of team virtuality by exploring its impact on individual counterproductive knowledge behaviors, particularly knowledge hiding. It examines the mediating roles of cognitive and affective trust and the moderating influence of learning goal orientation, addressing a significant gap in understanding how virtual interactions affect knowledge management processes at the individual level. Design/methodology/approach We conducted a three-wave online survey with a matched sample of 274 employees who have virtual work experience in China. We performed a series of structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses using Mplus 8.3 to test our proposed hypotheses. Findings The results indicate a significantly positive association between perceived team virtuality and individual knowledge hiding, mediated by both cognition- and affect-based trust, with the latter showing a stronger mediation effect. Additionally, individual learning goal orientation negatively moderates the indirect relationship between perceived team virtuality and knowledge hiding via cognitive (affective) trust. Practical implications By understanding the mechanisms through which virtuality influences individual knowledge behaviors within teams, organizations can provide emotional and instructional support for virtual interactions to mitigate knowledge hiding and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of knowledge management. Originality/value This study offers a differentiated analysis by exploring the mediating roles of cognitive and affective trust and the moderating role of learning goal orientation within virtual environments. Previous research has not concurrently examined these variables within the framework of team virtuality and knowledge hiding, making this research pivotal in enhancing the theoretical and practical understanding of individual knowledge behaviors in virtual settings.",

          "authors": "You-Hung Lin, Hsin Hsin Chang, Chun Po Chiu",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to develop a conceptual model for GET products that participate in brands’ online communities, based on social cognitive theory (SCT), with environmental factors, personal factors and behavioral factors being used to explore whether users of GET products participate in brand online communities as well as to determine whether participation in a community forum causes users to stick with GET products. In addition, expectancy confirmation is also considered in the research model. Design/methodology/approach This research examines whether environmental and personal factors have a positive effect on the behavioral factors of Gogoro users, and then further effects on green energy technology (GET) product stickiness for users in online communities. A website was used to distribute links to two Facebook club sites: Gogoro Series 2 Fan Club and the Gogoro Fan Club. The respondents’ qualification criteria were restricted to people who had used Gogoro products and participated in a Gogoro online community. A total of 581 valid responses were collected for structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis, and expectancy confirmation was found to be moderate from a hierarchical regression. Findings The results of SEM show that virtual interactivity has a positive effect on product-related content, and social norms were found to have significant effects on creating product-related content. Brand community identification, perceived relative advantage and brand knowledge self-efficacy are found to be related to both creating and contributing product-related content. Also, creating product-related content and contributing user participation behaviors influence ET product stickiness. Practical implications Online community managers can boost user participation by increasing interaction, and community identification by enhancing users’ perceptions of benefiting from participating in their communities. Companies can also encourage users to create product-related content to increase users’ stickiness to GET products. Further, GET companies can try to enhance users’ intrinsic connection with other community users to increase their brand community identification if they want to increase users’ willingness to participate. Originality/value This study adopted SCT to measure the GET product stickiness formation process in an attempt to determine what factors boost user participation based on triadic reciprocality. Also, expectancy confirmation plays an important role in the relationship between community users’ participation behaviors and GET product stickiness. The results indicated that it was appropriate to add virtual interactivity to environmental factors and perceived relative advantage to personal factors to measure users’ participation in an online social community. Actual product users’ online community participation behavior could be a very influential indicator of actual product stickiness formation.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The esports industry has experienced a dynamic growth. In this context, a significant evolution in the logic of corporate social responsibility (CSR) can be observed, particularly in the digital sphere. By extending Carroll’s three-dimensional model to include corporate digital responsibility (CDR), this paper addresses a key research question: How does CSR evolve and develop in the dynamic digital industry of esports? Design/methodology/approach This study employed a qualitative multiple case study research design. It drew on secondary data from 50 professional esports organisations and key players in CSR development in the global esports industry, such as game publishers, pro-teams, pro-athletes, event organisers, and governing bodies. A content analysis of 50 official websites and 72 public annual, CSR, and environmental reports for the financial years ending in 2021 and 2022 was conducted. Findings Our empirical findings not only map the territory of esports CSR and CDR but also provide practical insights. These insights are later synthesized to develop an esports CSR/CDR framework that extends Carroll’s three-dimensional model. CSR and CDR domains of esports are theoretically grounded (business performance, responsiveness, social issues, and digital responsibilities), while practical implications for managers and academics are forwarded. Originality/value This paper stands out as a pioneering empirical study, filling a significant research gap in the fields of CSR and CDR in esports. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first to illuminate these concepts within the unique ecosystem of esports, thereby contributing to the evolving understanding of CSR in the digital context.",

          "authors": "Mark Boukes",
          "abstract": "Political satire is often believed to enrich the public sphere in ways distinct from traditional journalism. This study examines whether deliberative qualities of online political talk in response to satire differ from those in response to regular news or partisan news. The analysis focuses on four normative standards: interactivity, diversity, rationality, and civility. A manual content analysis of YouTube comments (n = 2,447) reveals that the public sphere surrounding political satire shows a notable strength: Less incivility, both in terms of impoliteness and intolerance. Surprisingly, aside from this, satire’s public sphere did not differ much from that of regular news. Comments on partisan news were more opinionated and ideologically diverse. These findings suggest that online political talk prompted by satire is not inferior to that of traditional news. Additionally, this study highlights how the presence of different normative standards is often interconnected.",

          "abstract": "This research evaluates news during the first year of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in order to examine how European publics made sense of the Roma, the largest and most marginalized ethnic community on the continent. Based on the analysis of news in English, French, Italian, and Romanian, the study finds that much of the coverage across national and cultural boundaries translated marginalization, already exacerbated by the health crisis, through familiar lenses of blame and backwardness. Whereas anti-ethnic discrimination was primarily recognized in news reliant on official, governmental sources, news in French and Italian chiefly circulated representations of otherness. Romanian news revealed both systemic racism and community solutions, also filtered through a discriminatory lens. Translating justice- or equity-oriented content—directly or ideologically—appeared incomplete, infrequent, and often filtered through bias.

          "abstract": "Language bias, both positive and negative, is a well-documented phenomenon exhibited among human interlocutors. We examine whether this bias is exhibited toward virtual assistants, specifically, Apple's Siri and Google Assistant, with various accents. We conducted three studies with different stimuli and designs to investigate U.S. English speakers’ attitudes toward Google's British, Indian, and American voices and Apple's Irish, Indian, South African, British, Australian, and American voices. Analysis reveals consistently lower fluency ratings for Irish, Indian, and South African voices (compared with American) but no consistent results of bias related to competence, warmth, or willingness to interact. Moreover, participants often misidentified voices’ countries of origin but correctly identified them as artificial. We conclude that this overall lack of bias may be due to two possibilities: lack of humanlikeness of the voices and lack of availability of nonstandardized voices and voices from countries toward which those in the United States typically show bias.",

However, there is a lack of systematic integration of these two research lines. We conducted a systematic scoping review of empirically tested psychological interventions (N = 176) to counteract misinformation. We developed an intervention map and analyzed boosting, inoculation, identity management, nudging, and fact-checking interventions as well as various subdimensions. We further examined how these interventions are theoretically derived from the two most prominent psychological accounts for misinformation susceptibility: classical and motivated reasoning. We find that the majority of misinformation studies examined fact-checking interventions, are poorly linked to basic psychological theory and not geared towards reducing motivated reasoning. Based on this, we outline future research avenues for effective psychological countermeasures against misinformation.",

We investigated whether implicit skin-tone bias, as typically found for human faces, also exists for emojis – a topic that is becoming increasingly relevant in computer-mediated communication (CMC) as more of our communication, education, and social exchange takes place in digital spaces. We systematically adapted Harvard University’s most recent skin-tone IAT (Implicit Associations Test) to assess implicit skin-tone bias for emojis. The reliability of our novel skin-tone IAT was good (internal consistency = .87). Data from a racially and ethnically diverse sample of 248 participants revealed that, on average, participants held more positive implicit associations for light than for dark skin-tone emojis: M Dscore  = 0.39; SD Dscore  = 0.42; t(247) = 14.76, p &lt; .001; Cohen’s d = 0.93. Participants’ own skin tone predicted the strength of skin-tone bias, R 2  = .02, F(1, 247) = 5.41, p = .02. The darker the skin tone of the participants, the less likely they were to exhibit bias in favor of light skin-tone emojis (β = −.14). These results align with the patterns of skin-tone bias that are typically observed for human faces, and extend those insights to emojis that are frequently used in CMC. The results also provide the first evidence that our novel emoji skin-tone IAT can be a useful tool for assessing emoji skin-tone bias.",

The review followed the PRISMA guidelines and was pre-registered in PROSPERO. PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed were searched, and seven articles met the inclusion criteria. The review identified two distinct portrayals of women with experiences of violence on social media: a stigmatizing representation of women as victims and a portrayal of women as survivors. Therefore, the review shows that social media has the potential to convey a positive representation of women and to raise public awareness on this social issue. Nonetheless, if not used responsibly, social media can contribute to spreading stigmatizing beliefs toward violence against women. In conclusion, this review provides an up-to-date understanding of the portrayal of women with an experience of violence on social media, highlighting the significant influence that social media has on public perceptions.",

Our paper connects these disparate literatures to consider the ways in which a combination of sleep and media use affect sociopolitical attitudes related to risk and/or threat perception. Using novel data from a large US survey, we found that participants who consume high levels of media coverage in a more fatigued state tend to be most supportive of a US border wall and of increased spending on defense and police. Analyses further suggest an association between sleep, media use, and risk preferences. These results offer preliminary evidence for an as-yet wholly under-explored and likely increasingly important moderator for those interested in the effects of media use: sleep.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: Currently, not only are partisans’ feelings toward Democrats and Republicans sharply divided along party lines, but so too are their choices regarding news media. Regarding this polarization, most studies have considered partisans’ selective use of news outlets as a crucial factor in widening affective polarization. However, insufficient attention has been directed to the potential role of affective polarization in selective exposure. Accordingly, this study seeks to fill this gap by verifying the effect of affective polarization on selective exposure and examining a potential mechanism using two-wave panel data. Our findings demonstrate that the degree of affective polarization is positively related to partisan bias in the credibility judgment of pro-party and counter-party cable news channels. In turn, favorable in-group bias in the credibility judgment of cable news channels has a significant effect on selective exposure to cable news outlets, mediating the effect of individual-level affective polarization on selective exposure. Lastly, we discuss the theoretical implications of our findings.",

          "abstract": "Single parenthood is stigmatized, and the current research clarifies how beliefs about agency and communion correspond to this stigma. Consistent with social role theory, the agency and communion ascribed to parents should reflect their success in meeting the demands of parental roles. Yet, the association of single parents with lower socioeconomic status than married parents likely compromises confidence that single parents can fulfill their parental role obligations and, therefore, lowers their perceived agency and communion. To test this account of beliefs about single parents, four experiments ( N = 1003) used multiple methods and samples to examine participants’ beliefs about single and married parents and the psychological links between marital status, socioeconomic status, and the ascription of agency and communion. In general, participants ascribed less agency and communion to single than married parents but not to single parents described as high in socioeconomic status (well-educated and financially well-off).",

          "abstract": "Managing relationship conflict is a difficult yet crucial task for romantic partners. We investigated how imagining a conflict’s resolution affects the engagement in resolving that conflict. For instance, people may indulge in positive fantasies about their future, or they may mentally contrast their desired future (successful conflict resolution) with the main inner obstacle (e.g., anger, frustration) in the current reality. In two experiments, we tested whether mental contrasting increases engagement in resolving ongoing relationship conflicts participants perceived as important (i.e., high incentive value) and solvable (i.e., high expectations of success). In Experiment 1 ( N = 274, from predominantly satisfied relationships), mental contrasting compared to indulging improved the resolution of solvable conflicts over two weeks. This effect did not extend to conflicts of highest importance, which we found to be particularly severe. In Experiment 2 ( N = 270, from less satisfied relationships), mental contrasting, compared to indulging and to working on a concentration task, increased mental engagement with highly important, more severe conflicts over two weeks. Results suggest that mental contrasting helps in resolving solvable conflicts. When facing more severe, less solvable conflicts, however, mental contrasting stimulated mental engagement with conflicts. Our findings suggest that teaching people mental contrasting may complement existing conflict management approaches (e.g., in counseling or in self-help apps).",

Yet, this remains understudied, while it is crucial for student’s wellbeing. Therefore, this study investigates how the personality traits of the Five-Factor Model interact with the role friendships and preferred collaboration relationships. In a sample of 95 university students, socio-centric data were collected with questionnaires on personality traits and longitudinally on networks of friendship and preferences for collaboration networks. Utilizing stochastic actor-oriented models in RSiena, we showed that students more open to new experiences established more friendships, preferred more collaborations with their peers, and were also more popular in both networks than students less open-to-new-experiences. Students scoring higher on agreeableness were less likely to connect to their peers in both networks, whereas higher-achieving students were more likely to establish peer relationships in both networks. Furthermore, friends were preferred for collaboration (and vice versa), indicating an overlap. This study points to the importance of personality traits and achievement when students integrate into their social and academic environment.",

          "abstract": "Research has shown that individuals from sexual and gender minorities are more likely to be stigmatized. Taking the perceiver’s perspective, we conducted two experimental studies to examine gender nonconformity stigma and the conditions under which such stigma is more (or less) likely to emerge. In both studies, participants were asked to read descriptions of targets varying in gender (non)conformity and assigned sex (Study 1; N = 337) or sexual identity (Study 2; N = 406). Results from both studies showed that participants preferred more social distance from gender nonconforming (vs. conforming) targets, tended to dehumanize them (i.e., attributed them more primary and less secondary emotions), and reported less anti-violence behavioral intentions and justifications. In both studies, results further showed that having more frequent and positive personal contact with gender nonconforming individuals helps buffer against gender nonconformity bias. Unexpectedly, results from Study 2 showed that humanizing gender nonconforming targets (rather than dehumanizing them) was associated with more violence predispositions for participants who reported having more negative personal contact with gender nonconforming individuals. No differences were found according to the targets’ assigned sex or sexual identity. Taken together, our findings highlight the need to understand the causes and boundaries of gender nonconformity bias.",

          "authors": "Selina Noetzel, Alice Binder, Jörg Matthes",
          "abstract": "Political microtargeting is a popular campaign tool in elections worldwide. However, it is associated with democratic risks. Foremost, scholars and policymakers are concerned that citizens cannot cope with political microtargeting and, thus, stand vulnerable to persuasion. To assess this risk, an in-depth understanding of how citizens make sense of and cope with political microtargeting is required. However, empirical studies are scarce, partially inconclusive, and provide global rather than nuanced insights. This study contributes to this research by employing an innovative, qualitative gaze-cued retrospective think-aloud design to distinguish coping patterns and, based on that, assess citizens’ vulnerability to persuasion via political microtargeting (&lt;em&gt;N &lt;/em&gt;= 25). The results reveal similarities regarding conceptual persuasion knowledge activation (i.e., advertising and targeting awareness) but differences in attitudinal and behavioral coping, illustrated along five coping patterns (avoidance, coherence assessment, ad quality assessment, partisanship bias, and neutral observation). Only individuals who cope by neutrally observing the political message seem vulnerable to political microtargeting. For individuals who cope with political messages based on their partisanship, political microtargeting might strengthen existing ties but backlash when employed by a non-preferred party. This study informs educators and policymakers about citizens’ coping mechanisms with political microtargeting and their potential vulnerability, which may guide intervention and regulation decisions.",

Based on the equalisation vs. normalisation thesis, we identify party factors (size, age, government/opposition status, and electoral strongholds) that affect parties’ use of this instrument to a different degree in their campaigns. We aim to highlight parties’ use of Google Ads during the campaigns for the 2021 German Bundestag election, relying on the official data provided via Google’s Ad Library. We discuss both empirical work on the factors that determine the use of Google Ads and conceptual work on the merit and perils of such ads in democratic elections, and we present descriptive and exploratory findings of our deep dive into the archive of Google Ads.",

Using qualitative research methods, our study analyses the activities of seven prominent fact-checking organisations and two university-affiliated projects across Spain, Catalonia, Poland, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Argentina, and Brazil. Thus, our study aims to understand why fact-checking organisations have become involved in MIL education and training for youth and what types of MIL, approaches, and subjects fact-checking organisations employ in their MIL education and training initiatives for this audience. Our findings reveal a shift in these organisations toward actively promoting MIL education through dedicated divisions and teams driven by mission-oriented action and peer collaboration. Various institutions and political and educational policies support or hinder this transformation. A significant issue observed is the limited availability of open-access materials and general opacity regarding their pedagogical approaches. Although these organisations have integrated educational components into their models, achieving financial sustainability remains challenging.",

However, the advent of public ad libraries from Meta and Google provides an opportunity to measure the scope and variation in DDC practice in advertising across different types of sponsors and within sponsors across platforms. Using textual and audiovisual processing, we create a database of ads from the 2022 US elections. These data allow us to create an index that quantifies the extent of DDC at the level of the sponsor and platform. This index takes into account both the number of unique creatives placed and the similarity across those creatives. In addition, we explore the impact of sponsor resources, the office being sought, and the competitiveness of the race on the measure of DDC sophistication. Ultimately, our research establishes a measurement strategy for DDC that can be applied across ad sponsors, campaigns, parties, and even countries. Understanding the extent of DDC is vital for policy discussions surrounding the regulation of microtargeting and data privacy.",

          "authors": "Esmeralda Bon, Katharine Dommett, Rachel Gibson, Sanne Kruikemeier, Sophie Lecheler",
          "abstract": "Much of the research on political microtargeting has focused on growing public concerns about its use in elections, fuelling calls for greater regulation or even a ban on the practice. We contend that a more nuanced understanding of public attitudes toward microtargeting is required before further regulation is considered. Drawing on advertising psychology research and the results of academic analyses into microtargeting, we argue that individual concern, and by corollary, acceptance of microtargeting will vary based on socio-demographic characteristics and political orientations, and the type of personal data used. We hypothesise that microtargeting that relies on observable or publicly accessible personal information will be more accepted by voters than that which uses unobserved and inferred traits. We test these expectations and the expected variance of public acceptance by individual characteristics using comparative survey data from the US, Germany, and the Netherlands. We find that across countries and socio-demographic groups, not all microtargeting is considered equally problematic. For example, whereas the use of age and gender is generally deemed acceptable, the use of sexual orientation is not, and right-leaning individuals are more accepting than those who lean left. Additionally, overall, the US is more accepting of microtargeting than Germany or the Netherlands. Thus, we find that not all microtargeting is considered equally problematic across countries and socio-demographic groups. We conclude by calling for a more contextualised debate about the benefits and costs of political microtargeting and its use of “sensitive” data before the expansion of current regulation.",

          "authors": "Julien Figeac, Marie Neihouser, Ferdinand Le Coz",
          "abstract": "Research on data-driven campaigning has mostly focused on the strategies of central campaign teams. However, there is a lack of evidence explaining how parties and supporters use data-driven campaigning techniques to organise their social media campaigning. Do user engagement metrics influence the choice of campaign themes by encouraging political parties to concentrate their communication on issues that are most liked, commented on, and shared? Our study focuses on the use of Facebook by French political parties and their supporters during the 2022 presidential election campaign. We conducted a supervised content analysis based on machine learning to examine their Facebook posts (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 17,060). Our results show that the issues prioritized by parties on Facebook may be different from those that are most prominent in their broader communications. In most cases, however, these themes are not chosen based on user engagement, even for parties that claim to have developed their base through digital channels. Instead, the choice of themes seems influenced by more traditional campaign strategies, such as the desire to capture the electorate of their closest rival. In our conclusion, we discuss the implications of these findings for the adoption of data-driven campaigning in digital election communication across Europe.",

          "abstract": "Political campaigning in the US is unique in the global context for its lack of attention to the role of the party, largely due to the centrality and power of campaigns. In the US context, successful data-driven campaigning (DDC) has often been covered by the press and analyzed by US scholars as an innovative campaign creating new tools and new tactics (and earning more media coverage for them). This research investigates the oft-ignored role of party organizations in DDC in the US, and in doing so, highlights the invisible work of data maintenance that is their purview. Methodologically, it brings together interviews with staffers from both party organizations and campaigns with thematic analysis of news coverage to answer questions about how the data-driven practices of parties versus campaigns differ, how parties’ data work is (and is not) covered, and what, in staffers’ views, contributes to such coverage. Ultimately, this research highlights how a lack of attention to party organizations’ work has gone hand in hand with a lack of attention to maintenance work in both academic and public discussions of DDC.",

          "abstract": "This study examines data-driven campaign (DDC) practices in Sweden. We explore the extent of data-driven practices adopted in Swedish political campaigns, and parties’ motivations to adopt them. Since this is a comparison of domestic parties, we test the importance of four party-level factors—resources, structure, attitudes toward data use, and ideology—using extensive interviews with key campaign managers in Sweden during the 2022 election year. Our results show that the differences among the eight parties studied are rather small, and that systemic factors are more important than party variables to explain the adoption of data-driven approaches. Zooming in on these finer differences we distinguish between top DDC adopters (Social Democrats, Center, and Conservatives) and a lower tier with lower levels of DDC implementation. To explain the differences between the two tiers, we find that economic resources are important, with richer parties being more advanced in DDC use. Party structure, attitudes to data, and ideology do not affect the likelihood of a Swedish party using data analytics in their strategic decision-making. Instead, we suggest party type (catch-all vs. niche) is a potentially more useful party-level factor in explaining variation.",

The objective is to understand how, in this hostile environment, fact-checkers in these two countries manage to carry out their activities. Our findings reveal that fact-checkers are often victims of online bullying and harassment and fear reprisal from governments. This pushes them to self-censor, avoiding working on sensitive topics, such as military issues in Mali. In addition, fact-checking organizations in both countries highlight the difficulty of accessing reliable sources. Consequently, they focus more on debunking viral social media content, thus effectively becoming content moderators who have turned away from the mission of holding leaders accountable, one of the primary functions of fact-checking. Regarding their role conception, fact-checkers in Ethiopia and Mali see themselves more as guides helping navigate the information disorder than “guardians of truth” or “truth keepers.”",

Whereas previous studies have focused on how populist challengers mobilise support during times of crisis, less attention has been paid to the overall usage of populist communication among political parties during periods of crisis. Therefore, this study takes a communication-oriented approach to analyse the overall usage of populist communication during two different crises, namely the euro crisis and the refugee crisis, to determine which one, if either, provides fertile ground for populist political communication. The findings reveal that crises do affect the usage of populist communication, although to different degrees depending on the crisis. Furthermore, niche and opposition parties utilise such communication more than mainstream and government parties. It is therefore suggested that crises influence the use of populist messaging, but factors such as government role and party status also significantly affect the usage of populist communication.",

This study employs a comparative media content analysis to identify sociotechnical imaginaries of agricultural gene editing and the actors who perform them in five countries with contrasting regulatory and cultural contexts: Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and the United States. We find that news media in these countries reinforce a predominantly positive portrayal of the technology’s future, although variations in which imaginaries are most mobilized exist based on the regulatory status of gene editing and unique histories of civil society engagement around biotechnology in each country. We argue that by granting legitimacy to some narratives over others, the media supports gene editing as a desirable and necessary component of future agrifood systems, thereby limiting consideration of broader issues related to the technology’s development and application.",

          "authors": "Lina Buttgereit, Michael Hameleers, Katjana Gattermann, Andreas Schuck",
          "abstract": "Media criticism is a crucial part of meta-journalistic discourse, ensuring that journalists adhere to their democratic functions, such as informing citizens in an honest and complete manner. However, the profession increasingly faces hostile, nonevidence-based attacks from politicians that attempt to strategically fuel distrust among citizens and delegitimize opposed viewpoints. Despite this reality, we lack a systematic overview of the boundaries between constructive feedback and weaponized attacks in media criticism. To address this gap, we inductively analyzed how media criticism is represented within the social media discourse of ten German politicians from all major parties. Using a grounded theory approach, we conducted a qualitative content analysis of a subset of their tweets from 2015, 2017, and 2022 that contain media criticism ( N = 545), mapping the types and severity of the criticism, the construction of opposing narratives, and the explicitness of references to facticity over opinions. We identified four themes within media criticism discourse, ranging from misinformation attributions to severe accusations of the intentional distortion of reality through the media. Politicians (strategically) employ a wide range of media criticism and inaccuracy claims beyond judgments of facticity with differing degrees of severity for the profession. Based on our findings, we propose a typology of media criticism from political elites that adds nuance to our understanding regarding the boundaries between supportive and disruptive criticism for journalism.",
