          "title": "Investigating relational uncertainty and trauma among romantic partners: a theoretical roadmap",
          "authors": "Kirsten Pool",
          "abstract": "Traumatic events, such as car accidents, interpersonal violence, and natural disasters, can create a sense of horror, fear, helplessness, and/or threaten people’s well-being (National Institute of Mental Health, 2022). The chaos that ensues from a traumatic event can disrupt the functioning of a person’s romantic relationship and create an environment ripe for relational uncertainty. As a result, many scholarly questions arise about the connections among relational uncertainty, communication, and trauma. However, a guide for determining the theoretical lens best suited for explorations of the aforementioned questions remains to be explicated. To fill this gap, I employ a critical narrative review of the literature to identify, evaluate, and critique the uncertainty theories most advantageous for investigating relational uncertainty among couples navigating the aftermath of traumatic events.",

          "authors": "Tom Livingstone",
          "abstract": "This article contextualizes the UKRI funded project ‘Virtual Production at Model Scale’ that took part within Aardman Animations Studio as part of the MyWorld R&amp;D project. Considering the particularities of both stop-frame animation, large studio production cultures, the wider animation landscape and the dominant softwares within stop-frame production as well as the emergent orthodoxies of Virtual Production, this article sets the stage for a sequence of experiments that took place within Aardman in order to explore the use of virtual production toolkits. This article outlines the development and testing of the experimental toolkits before reflecting on possible areas of further research and avenues of implementation for the virtual production paradigm within creative and material practices that are not amenable to the adoption of off-the-shelf Virtual Production software, tools and methods.",

          "authors": "Woochul Kim",
          "abstract": "This study compares Netflix Korean original films with top-grossing Korean theatrical films using Napoli’s diversity taxonomy. Drawing on a cross-sectional sample (2021–2024) with a historical benchmark (2006–2020), it assesses differences in source diversity (production-company concentration), content diversity (genres, creative roles, and expressive intensity via age ratings), and the narrative articulation of Korean locality. The results reveal that while Netflix functions as a new type of investor creating opportunities for some filmmakers, it operates within entrenched patterns of capital concentration while exhibiting selective diversification across content dimensions. These findings suggest that Netflix’s promotional rhetoric of global diversity functions less as straightforward cultural inclusion than as a market expansion strategy that reinforces broader patterns of capital accumulation, revealing the complex entanglement of diversity discourse with platform capitalism.",

          "authors": "Abby Youran Qin, Fan Xiao, Linjie Dai",
          "abstract": "In recent years, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has intensified its propaganda efforts beyond the Great Firewall, aiming to ‘tell China’s story well’ to global audiences. Meanwhile, many YouTube influencers have emerged to tell the opposite kind of stories – anti-CCP conspiracy theories – which have attracted millions of Chinese-speaking viewers both inside and outside China. Drawing on Habermas’s theory of communicative action, this study combines social network analysis and critical discourse analysis to examine the networks and narratives of these conspiratorial actors. We identified a strategically coordinated Falun Gong group, a tightly knitted Whistle-blower Movement block, and a loosely connected residual of political dissidents. Through critical discourse analysis of seven central channels, we illustrate how anti-CCP conspiracy theorists legitimize their extraordinary claims by (1) leaping from basic facts to morally embellished informative fictions and (2) making reassuring doomsday predictions that dissipate revolutionary potential. We show how anti-CCP conspiracy theorists exploit progressive ideals for strategic purposes, complicating the notion of dissent while demonstrating that the dichotomy of ‘authoritarianism versus anti-authoritarianism’ is inadequate for capturing the complexities of the transnational Chinese-language media ecology today.",

          "abstract": "Previous research on digital media and well-being showed that the impact of media technologies on users largely depends on specific usage characteristics, context, and individual user factors. This research report explores the existence of distinct user profiles in virtual reality (VR), using an existing dataset and applying latent class analysis. The results point to the existence of three classes: two of them primarily include VR game users, who differ in the intensity of their psychological engagement (sense of presence) during gameplay, and a third class that includes users of social VR platforms, who report a relatively very high level of engagement with these platforms. The three groups differ in symptoms of addiction to the technology. These results provide valuable proof of concept for the usefulness of identifying usage profiles as a way to reveal how the relationship between VR and well-being might vary across different usage situations.",

          "authors": "Isaac Vaghefi",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study investigates the temporary discontinuance of social media. Building on stimulus-response binding and priming mechanisms, we propose a research model illustrating how compulsive social media use–through hedonic consumption, social interaction and content sharing–shapes temporary discontinuance. We argue that compulsive use can be modulated by cognition-based priming effects (cognitive dissonance and attitudes toward discontinuance) and affect-based priming effects (somatic and self-evaluative mood states), with exposure to cues (e.g. social media apps on smartphones) acting as a potential moderator. Design/methodology/approach We tested our model through a field study and quantitative analysis of Facebook users who voluntarily took a break from the platform. An objective assessment of participants’ temporary discontinuance was used to validate the model. Structural equation modeling was employed to analyze relationships between compulsive social media use, priming effects and discontinuance behaviors. Findings The results indicate that compulsive social media use can both directly and indirectly influence temporary discontinuance. Cognition-based priming (cognitive dissonance and attitudes) and affect-based priming (mood states) significantly shape discontinuance behavior, while exposure to cues moderates these relationships. The findings highlight the complex mechanisms underlying social media disengagement. Originality/value This study extends discontinuance behavior research in information systems (IS) by identifying priming effects as key mechanisms influencing temporary disengagement. The findings offer practical insights for users seeking to manage social media use, service providers designing interventions and policymakers addressing digital well-being.",

          "authors": "Yan Yu, Dan Ma, Meiyun Zuo",
          "abstract": "Purpose The advancement of information technology (IT) offers opportunities for leveraging senior-care services, a unique public service. Understanding how government leaders translate IT fashions into governmental actions is critically important for both scholars and practitioners in the current digital governance landscape. Drawing on sensemaking and social learning literature, we propose that government leaders’ IT fashion-grabbing and social learning influence their IT beliefs and the consequent governmental actions, including structural governance specification for and material engagement in IT-enabled senior-care services. Design/methodology/approach This study combined a survey methodology and objective data collection about reginal characters. 285 valid observations of town-level local governments in Beijing, China, were obtained. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used for model testing. Robustness checks were conducted. Findings The results validated the effects of government leaders’ grabbing and social learning practices on organizational actions on IT-enabled senior-care services and these effects were mediated by their meaning-construction on IT. Furthermore, leaders’ construction of IT beliefs exerted a larger effect on symbolic actions than on substantive actions of local governments. Practical implications Government leaders need more prospective sensemaking with insight on plausibility and future to adapt to the fast-changing IT fashion. Leaders’ social learning is important for their meaning-construction and governmental arrangement in IT-enabled senior-care service delivery. Originality/value This study contributes to juxtaposition of sensemaking and social learning for explaining the new IT-enabled senior-care service delivery.",

          "authors": "Fei Xiang, Chuanchuan Wu, Ting Cao, Guanyu Chen, Hong Wu",
          "abstract": "Purpose Women with gynecological illnesses frequently utilize Online Health Communities (OHCs) to share experiences and seek online consultations. However, the disclosure of sensitive health information heightens privacy risks. This study, grounded in the Multidimensional Development Theory (MDT), Communication Privacy Management Theory (CPM) and research on privacy fatigue (PF), developed a theoretical model to elucidate the factors that influence women's willingness to disclose reproductive health information in OHCs. Design/methodology/approach A total of 417 valid surveys were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to determine the impact of independent variable on information disclosure, the mediating role of PF and the moderating role of perceived industry regulation effectiveness. Additionally, a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was conducted to explore the multi-configurational pathways of information disclosure. Findings This study found that self-ego-related variables, such as disease stigmatization, positively influenced privacy concerns (PC) and disclosure willingness. PF positively influenced disclosure willingness and partially mediated the relationship between PC and information disclosure. Perceived industry regulation effectiveness negatively moderated the impact of PF on information disclosure and played a dual role. Four antecedent configurations were identified that influence women's willingness to disclose reproductive health information in OHCs. Originality/value This study advances the integration of MDT and CPM by incorporating PF to explain women's disclosure of reproductive health information in OHCs. By conceptualizing PF as boundary exhaustion, it extends CPM, while the application of fsQCA uncovers multiple causal configurations, thereby enhancing the explanatory capacity of MDT. This study offers both significant theoretical and practical contributions.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The prominence of online social networks (OSNs) has made them ideal platforms for viral marketing. Otome games efficiently use OSNs for viral campaigns, making them a valuable case for studying viral marketing strategies. This study identified key elements of viral marketing posts to inform the operational strategies of commercial accounts. Design/methodology/approach This study analyzed China's sizable otome game market using operational behavioral data from the top five games, compiled into the OtomeVM dataset. Following the knowledge discovery in databases framework, this study identified key characteristics of the top 25% most viral posts and proposed the ViralGD model, a multimodal machine learning model for virality prediction. The model's decision logic was further interpreted through a global surrogate method to ensure transparency. Findings This study identified lottery mechanisms as significant predictors of post virality, with optimal performance observed for content combining short videos of 180 s or less and long-text descriptions of 175 characters or more. Commercial social media accounts often produced emotionally homogeneous content, with emotions having minimal impact on the viral spread of their posts. Originality/value This study is the first to apply large-scale real-world data and data mining to uncover overlooked patterns in viral marketing, offering theoretical insights into defining virality and refining campaign design. Practically, the iterative application of the ViralGD model uncovers high-impact features that boost content diffusion, effectively guiding operators in selecting optimal improvements.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Gamification is a valuable educational tool. However, research indicates that while gamified learning systems cater to users' gaming motivations, they may induce maladaptive usage. Integrating the gamification affordances-psychological outcomes-behavioral outcomes paradigm and goal orientation theory, this study examines maladaptive goal orientation processes and their unintended psychological and behavioral impacts. Design/methodology/approach We tested the model through a scenario-based approach in the context of Duolingo, which is a leading and highly influential mobile language learning application. Data from 100 forum users who discussed score-boosting strategies were collected via online questionnaires and analyzed with structural equation modeling. Findings Gamification affordances include instruction design (i.e. instant individualistic feedback and instant competitive feedback) and interface design (i.e. multisensory interaction). Results reveal that, compared to instant individualistic feedback, instant competitive feedback is more likely to foster maladaptive psychological outcomes, namely, competence feeling and focused attention on game goals. Multisensory interaction shows no significant effect on competence feeling, whereas it exerts a significant impact on focused attention on game goals. Competence feeling, rather than focused attention on game goals, contributes to maladaptive behaviors within the gamified system. Originality/value This study is among the first to highlight maladaptive goal orientation in gamified learning. It distinguishes types of instant feedback and their effects, emphasizes the role of multisensory interaction and reveals how game objectives may override educational goals. The findings extend gamification theory and provide practical insights for designing learning systems that mitigate maladaptive outcomes.",

The field study confirmed these findings and further revealed that the need for human interaction moderates both the relationship between AI robot gratitude expression and OBSE, and the indirect effect of AI robot gratitude expression on change-oriented OCB via OBSE. Practical implications Our findings suggest that expressing gratitude via AI robots is beneficial.

          "abstract": "Purpose Enterprise social media (ESM) application in knowledge management is critical for individuals and organizations. However, there is limited empirical evidence regarding how ESM enhances individual knowledge management capability or whether prior experience affects the value derived from ESM. This study aims to understand the intricate relationships among ESM affordance, employees’ meta-knowledge, prior usage experience and knowledge management capability. Design/methodology/approach This study constructs an integrated framework based on the technology affordance perspective and meta-knowledge theory. It was validated through a two-stage survey, yielding 322 usable responses. Findings The affordance of ESM has a positive influence on individual meta-knowledge, which, in turn, enhances knowledge management capabilities. Additionally, visibility has a direct impact on meta-knowledge. Furthermore, prior experience significantly moderates the relationship between ESM affordance and meta-knowledge. Research limitations/implications This study contributes to the literature by offering a strategy for conducting theory-driven research on how ESM enhances individuals’ knowledge management capability from an affordance perspective. This study develops a framework by integrating ESM affordance and meta-knowledge, and offers a nuanced perspective that considers who knows what and who knows whom as individual meta-knowledge concepts.

          "authors": "Femke Roos, Hannah De Mulder",
          "abstract": "Though intended to refer to everyone, generically intended masculine role nouns are often interpreted as referring (primarily) to men. While the use of more inclusive forms counters this bias, previous studies have largely focused on languages with a salient masculine/feminine grammatical gender distinction and used measures that focus participants’ attention on gender. The present study uses an indirect measure and investigates Dutch, a grammatical gender language that has largely lost the distinction between masculine and feminine gender, but still uses gender-specific marking for role nouns. A total of 130 participants named the first three people they could think of when presented with either a word pair (e.g., zangers/zangeressen– “singers masculine /singers feminine ”) or a generically intended masculine ( zangers ). Compared to the generically intended masculine form, word pairs increased the mental availability of nonmen, suggesting that a more inclusive form facilitates activation of nonmasculine exemplars for speakers of Dutch as well.",

          "abstract": "Grammatical gender generally implies disadvantages for women (e.g., the generic masculine leading to real-life invisibility of women). Diverging from this idea, we here postulate that abstract concepts (such as “justice” or “democracy”), arguably reflecting the most sophisticated expression of human thought, are associated with femininity. Two archival studies (Study 1a, b) show the greater frequency of feminine gender among abstract nouns across seven (out of nine) Indo-European languages. Studies 2 and 4 show that feminine abstract nouns are envisaged as female, both explicitly and through a voice-assignment task. Furthermore, through Implicit Association Tests (IATs), we show that abstract concepts are associated with women as a social category (Studies 3a, b). Together, our studies show an association between abstractness and grammatical gender that carries psychological meaning through the gender congruency effect. Arguably, these cognitive processes may contribute to the idealization of women as “super-human,” through the association between abstractness and super-human imagery (Study 4).",

          "abstract": "Marriage is a fundamental right and personal choice for all people. However, societal attitudes present significant challenges for women with disabilities when contemplating marriage. This paper explores the experiences of Northern Vietnamese women with physical disabilities who faced opposition from their partners’ families regarding marriage. It draws on a qualitative study that explored the lived experiences of women with physical disabilities regarding pregnancy, childbirth, and maternal healthcare conducted in 2018. A two-staged in-depth interview was utilised. Initially, 29 women were interviewed, with 27 follow-up interviews conducted. Data was thematically analysed using Braun and Clarke’s approach (2013, 2019). Two key themes, with five subthemes, emerged: “marriage denied: gendered and ableist exclusion” and “marriage opposition: stigma and discrimination”. Findings underscore the pervasive influence of Vietnamese socio-cultural norms on the marital prospects of women with physical disabilities. Gender roles ascribed to wives, daughters-in-law, and mothers, coupled with ableist assumption and social stigma surrounding disability pose significant barriers to their marriages. These findings enhance understanding of the intersection of gender and disability, with implications for developing policies and programs that go beyond focusing solely on these factors, prioritise dismantling ableist and gender norms, and challenge negative perceptions of women with disabilities as “unworthy” of marriage.",

          "authors": "Arístides A. Vara-Horna, Zaida B. Asencios-Gonzalez, Noelia Rodríguez-Espartal",
          "abstract": "This study examines the often-overlooked health consequences experienced by women who provide informal support to survivors of intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW) in their communities. In contrast, extensive research has documented the physical and psychological impacts of violence on survivors; far less attention has been paid to the invisible costs borne by supporters—neighbors, friends, coworkers, or relatives—who are repeatedly exposed to traumatic disclosures and the demands of caregiving. Grounded in the complementary frameworks of Secondary Traumatic Stress, Vicarious Trauma, Compassion Fatigue, and Allostatic Load, this study conceptualizes the “cost of caring” as the cumulative psychological and physiological burden of informal caregiving. Unlike previous research that has focused mainly on professional providers, our analysis highlights the experiences of women embedded in gendered, community-based care networks. A two-phase cross-sectional probabilistic household survey design was implemented in two South American countries with a high prevalence of IPVAW. The exploratory phase was conducted in a high-incidence district in Peru ( n = 507), followed by a confirmatory phase using a nationally representative sample in Ecuador ( n = 2,501). Standardized instruments measured support intensity, emotional and physical morbidity, and personal victimization. Multivariate analyses, controlling for sociodemographic and violence-related covariates, showed that women providing support to IPVAW survivors reported significantly higher levels of emotional morbidity (β = .075–.083) and physical morbidity (β = .038–.058), even after adjusting for their own experiences of violence. Findings reveal a robust and statistically significant association between informal caregiving and increased health burden, underscoring that the impacts of violence extend beyond survivors to those who sustain them. By making these hidden costs visible, this study contributes to both the social support literature and the IPVAW field, reframing community-level caregiving as a critical public health issue. Although causal inference is limited by the cross-sectional design, the consistency of results across two countries strengthens the external validity and global relevance of the phenomenon.",

          "authors": "Liia-Maria Raippalinna, Suvi Mononen, Markus Mykkänen, Turo Uskali",
          "abstract": "Since the full-scale Russian military invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the war has been a central interest of the Western media. Eye-witnessing is considered vital, but to what extent is what is seen on site ultimately conveyed to the public? Regarding graphic images, publishing decisions are based on reconciling news value, privacy protection, and audience protection by adhering to formal media policies, informal organisational culture, cultural conventions, audience expectations, and the proximity of the object. However, little is known about the enactment of ethical principles in crisis journalists’ work and the filtering of suffering through the journalistic process. This article investigates ethical decision-making in Finnish newsrooms from orientation to photographing and publication. Based on 26 interviews with photographers reporting from Ukraine during the Russia–Ukraine war, we ask how central ethical principles—the duty to inform and the ethics of care—are reconciled and enacted in the portrayal of death and suffering. Our analysis shows that ethical principles are weighed differently depending on the phase of the process and the genre of journalism (conflict/feature) and are compromised by practical limitations: time, money, safety, and access. While ethical responsibility is distributed in newsrooms, tensions exist regarding the portrayal of suffering. Several journalists interviewed for this study perceived the conventional limits of violence representation as being too tight, distorting the audience’s perception of war. In addition, potential bias in the portrayal of suffering in the media imaginary, resulting from limited access and the cultural and political proximity of the war, causes ethical uncertainty.",

          "title": "Celebrity Suicides in China: How Social Media Shapes News Framing",
          "authors": "Shiyu (Sharon) Zheng, Shiyi Zhang",
          "abstract": "The proliferation of social media platforms has profoundly reshaped news reporting, particularly concerning sensitive events like suicide. This study investigates how Chinese news media framed the suicides of two high-profile female celebrities, Sulli and Coco Lee, on the influential social media platform Weibo. It examines the dominant reporting frames and explores how Weibo’s unique interactive environment influenced the framing process. Computational thematic analysis was employed to investigate dominant themes from Weibo posts published by verified news media accounts, and three primary frames were identified: mental health, gossip, and nationalism. While the mental health frame marked a shift from traditional Chinese reporting, it often remained superficial and was intertwined with sensational elements. The gossip frame, which centres on personal scandals and conflicts, aligns with the problematic sensationalism often observed in suicide reporting. The nationalism frame positioned the suicides within contexts of cultural comparison and national pride. Findings indicate that social media affordance significantly shaped these frames, resulting in more sensational and dynamically evolving narratives. This has shifted traditional gatekeeping and agenda-setting power, and potentially diminishes the quality and responsibility of reporting. This research highlights the complex interplay between journalistic norms, platform dynamics, and audience interaction in the digital news era, underscoring the need for updated approaches to responsible reporting on social media.",

          "authors": "Anisha Arenz, Anna Schnauber-Stockmann",
          "abstract": "Co-present smartphone use—the use of smartphones in the presence of others—is a prevalent behavior in social contexts. However, the situational mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. While previous research has primarily conceptualized co-present smartphone use as a stable individual disposition and focused on person-level determinants, the role of specific situational characteristics has remained largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, the present study investigates co-present smartphone use from a situational perspective, aiming to gain insights into the situational predictors of co-present smartphone use. We conducted an experience sampling study with 87 participants, reporting on 829 social interactions to examine how co-present use is linked to different types of connection cues (technical, spatial, and mental). The findings show that a person's smartphone use during an interaction is related to the smartphone use of others present and the number of notifications received.",

          "authors": "Jingwen Gan",
          "abstract": "While older adults are often overlooked as active participants in economic life, their ways of earning and earmarking money demonstrate their agency, creativity, and efforts to maintain social relations and financial autonomy. This paper draws on participant observation and interview data collected from five communities in Shanghai to explore why older adults (aged 60 or above) are highly attracted to money-earning apps. These apps offer monetary rewards or free goods through gamified and social activities such as mini games, video consumption, friend referrals, and physical exercise. The paper argues that gamified money-earning apps fulfill multiple aims of older adults by combining their desires for passing the time, entertainment, financial reward, and social interaction. Gamified money-earning apps are deeply embedded in the social lives of older adults in Shanghai. Through daily use of apps, they redefine and categorize their existing intimate relationships, build connections with new social networks, and shape their social practices.",

          "authors": "Hila Lowenstein-Barkai, Elie Friedman, Hananel Rosenberg",
          "abstract": "This study explores how digital humor functions as a form of critique in contexts where overt dissent is constrained. Focusing on memes shared by members of a Facebook support group for Israeli reservist soldiers’ wives during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, the study analyzes how humor helps negotiate personal and collective tensions. Using thematic and critical discourse analysis, we identify four spheres of critique—targeting spouses, social circles, institutions, and broader expectations. These memes convey frustration and resistance not through direct confrontation, but via irony and satire, allowing women to express grievances while remaining aligned with hegemonic national narratives. We conceptualize this as quasi-political expression, where personal complaints, framed humorously, subtly challenge and reinforce dominant discourses. By introducing this concept, the study highlights how individuals in ideologically constrained settings use digital culture not only to resist or reproduce power, but to navigate the blurred boundaries between personal and political life.",

          "abstract": "We are now living in a platform society, where platforms are widely acknowledged to exert significant control over users. But how can user agency exert power to influence the platform? To explore this question, the study conducts in-depth interviews with 21 Xiaohongshu users and analyzes their imagined affordances of this Chinese UGC platform. It finds that users creatively engage with and repurpose the platform based on their imagination, thereby transforming Xiaohongshu from a “developer-envisioned platform” into four distinct forms of the “platform in actual use.” These user agency-driven practices serve as ways of reshaping the platform’s meanings, functions, and values. By centering user agency, this research may offer platform studies a new perspective on power dynamics, shifting the current focus away from the dominance of platforms.",

          "abstract": "This article examines how far-right groups advance political agendas through digital platforms, specifically by embedding reactionary ideology within health and wellness discourse. Our investigation concerns the “Barbarian Right” subculture on X (formerly Twitter), where reactionary content is often intertwined with wellness messaging. Using social network analysis of 42 accounts identified through digital ethnography, we mapped the structure of this community and identified key influencers. Subsequent semiotic discourse analysis revealed ideological practices and their relationship to platform affordances. Our findings reveal a small number of prominent accounts, supported by alternative media outlets that dominate this space. These accounts primarily deliver health advice strategically interspersed with white nationalist messaging. This research offers empirical insights into the growing alignment between far-right and wellness communities, shedding light on potential radicalization pathways and recruitment strategies of the dissident right.",

          "authors": "Haonan Li, Yufan Liang",
          "abstract": "This study examines how digital affinity groups construct collective identity in the context of the TikTok ban in the United States, which led to a large-scale migration of American users to the Chinese social media platform REDNOTE (Little Red Book). Using Collins’ Interaction Ritual Chains theory as a framework, we conducted participant observation, content analysis, and computational textual analysis of over 1000 high-engagement posts and 9000 comments under the #TikTokRefugee hashtag on REDNOTE. Our findings show that platform algorithms facilitate virtual co-presence and help form symbolic boundaries between American and Chinese users. Through shared experiences, emotional exchanges, and multimodal interactions (such as bilingual memes and cultural symbols), users developed a sense of group belonging and constructed a new “TikTok Refugee” identity. The study reveals a dynamic process of confrontation and integration: while users express resistance to the ban and reinforce group solidarity, they also engage in cross-cultural dialogue and adapt their identities. These results highlight the dual role of platform algorithms and emotional energy in shaping digital communities, offering new insights into how online platforms mediate identity formation in transnational contexts.",

          "abstract": "This study analyzes how short-video platforms, with Douyin as a case, depend on cultural intermediaries (e.g. multi-channel networks and digital marketing agencies) to sustain operations and expand platform power. Unlike existing studies that exaggerate or underestimate cultural intermediaries’ agency, this study offers a middle-ground perspective and conceptualizes it as “infrastructural intermediation,” in which cultural intermediaries act as external dispositifs of platform power in cultural production. Using participant observation and interviews with intermediaries and creators, we identify three primary infrastructural functions: (1) visualizing: converting data into actionable guidance for platform strategy implementation; (2) reinforcing: optimizing creators’ practices to advance monetization; and (3) repairing: remedying deficiencies in technical and institutional mechanisms. As an indispensable component of the platform, they reinforce platformization structures, complete the “last mile” of platform power implementation. This study also reveals how China’s distinctive state-platform relationship shapes the role and strategies of cultural intermediaries.",

          "abstract": "Physical affection‐sharing (e.g., holding hands) is associated with better relational well‐being. But does similarity/dissimilarity in couple members' comfort with affection‐sharing also predict relationship well‐being? The current study utilized data collected from an online self‐report survey at both the individual ( n = 1832) and dyadic ( n = 86 couples) level, to assess whether partners' mean comfort with affection‐sharing, as well as their perceived/actual similarity, predicted relationship well‐being, and whether any associations varied by context (public vs. private) and/or relationship type (same‐sex vs. mixed‐sex). Considering these contextual variables may be important, as those in same‐sex relationships are less comfortable with public affection‐sharing due to ongoing stigma. Higher mean comfort with affection‐sharing was generally associated with better relationship well‐being, more strongly so in private than in public. Perceived dissimilarities in couple members' comfort with affection sharing were consistently associated with worse well‐being at the bivariate level. Results were less consistent when considering actual similarity/dissimilarity and when controlling for mean comfort levels. There were minor variations in the patterns for those in same‐sex and mixed‐sex relationships; overall, though, results were much more similar than different across relationship types.",

          "abstract": "Using a 2 (social endorsement: high vs. low) × 2 (AI comment type: approving vs. disapproving) experiment, we examine how AI-generated comments and social endorsement cues jointly influence information-seeking intentions in response to social media health misinformation. Results reveal a moderated-moderated mediation: When AI trustworthiness is high and social endorsement is low, debunking comments promote cognitive elaboration, which in turn increases information-seeking intentions. This pathway suggests that deeper cognitive processing of AI corrections makes individuals more receptive to seeking additional verification. When AI trustworthiness is low, debunking is largely ineffective. Notably, under low trustworthiness and endorsement, misinformation-supporting comments can unexpectedly elicit more elaboration, potentially triggering skepticism-driven information seeking. These findings underscore the importance of AI trustworthiness and reveal nuanced mechanisms in how individuals respond to AI-based health misinformation interventions, highlighting that cognitive elaboration serves as a critical bridge between AI interventions and behavioral intentions.",

Findings showed technique tips on how to identify deepfakes improved deepfake detection, perceived AI literacy, and self-efficacy, while the video format was most effective in elevating perceived AI literacy.

          "authors": "Alexandria Arrieta",
          "abstract": "As the lifespan of virality on TikTok has become increasingly short and operates at a smaller scale, music creators are grappling with what it means to be successful in this later stage of the platform. For this study, I conducted 27 semi-structured interviews with music artists and creators about how short-form video platforms like TikTok have affected the way they work and create music. Many participants believe that while the creation of viral content based on memes and covers of popular songs affords constant visibility, it does not result in the monetary or career milestones that they desire, so they need to use different approaches. In this article, I characterize this new period of online musical labor as a period defined by “platform negotiation,” in which creators evaluate platform demands and work to approach their content creation in ways that prioritize their personal and professional goals. This includes strategic decision-making to negotiate their presence—which can include their identity, brand, image, etc.—across platforms over time. As they engage in relational labor to support continued work, music creators cannot simply rely on the tenets of optimization to be successful. Rather, many are pivoting to utilizing content creation in ways that aim to prioritize fandom and career sustainability. This article examines the ways in which music creators grapple with the challenges of short-form video and how musical labor is changing online.",

          "authors": "Sylvain Parasie, Antoine Machut, Béatrice Mazoyer",
          "abstract": "This article explores the role played by legacy media in the pervasive situation where far-right activists highly politicize migrant crimes on social media. Focusing on particular crimes they consider indicative of a state’s failure to secure borders and protect its citizens, they utilize social media platforms to mobilize and garner political and media attention. However, little is known about the dynamics of influence between far-right activism on social media and legacy media in the process of politicizing migrant crimes. To overcome the analytical and methodological limitations of current research, we have developed a computational method to capture the public discussion that took place in France around a single event – the murder of a young teenager in Paris in October 2022. Applying an event identification algorithm to a vast corpus of Twitter data has enabled us to analyze the dynamics of public discussion held in various arenas, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This article’s main argument is that legacy media act as a “moral compass” vis-à-vis far-right mobilizations that politicize migrant crimes on social media. While they were unable to influence the volume of attention that social media users pay to this murder, the French legacy media have contributed to setting limits to the form and spread of politicization by the far right on social media. More specifically, they were able to influence the attention paid to the facts that serve as the basis for discussion on social media and to steer that discussion toward questioning the relevance of politicizing the crime.",

          "abstract": "Over the past three decades, close to 140 countries worldwide – including 18 in Latin America – have enacted access to information (ATI) laws. Recent increases in populism, authoritarianism, and harassment of the press, however, have been accompanied by rollbacks in public transparency and ATI, raising questions about the factors shaping journalists’ use and perceptions of ATI laws and government transparency more generally. In one of the largest cross-national ATI surveys to date, we draw on responses from 678 journalists across Latin America to examine the influence of macro-level factors – including populist leadership, press freedom, and characteristics of ATI laws – on journalists’ experiences with information access. Our findings show that populist leadership has significantly negative effects on ATI use and experience, in line with other evaluations. However, our findings reveal several unexpected results, including the null effect of the age and legal strength of ATI laws on usage and the statistically significant relationship between negative press freedom and increased ATI use. Overall, our results show that two-thirds of our sample make use of information access laws. And despite negative experiences, journalists continue to file information requests, and the more requests they file, the more positive their assessment of government transparency. Our study thus suggests that ATI laws provide substantially positive returns to both journalists and governments.",

It is a foundational text that frames mainstream narrative cinema as a type of discourse that disseminates patriarchal ideology. Rather than summarize the essay again or repeat the many critiques developed by other scholars, this essay presents a line-by-line commentary on Mulvey’s interpretation of visual features in Josef von Sternberg’s films presented in section III C2 of her essay, in order to determine the logical relation between those visual features and theoretical concepts (especially fetishism). This involves rationally reconstructing the implicit operational procedures (empirical methods and evidence) Mulvey employed to interpret patriarchal values in mainstream narrative cinema. Operationalizing demystifies Mulvey’s interpretive activity by bridging the gap between her abstract theoretical predicates and filmic images, rendering the act of interpretation replicable by students new to film analysis.",
