          "authors": "Irina Lock, Lukas Benedikt Hoffmann, Christian Burgers, Theo Araujo",
          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has become pervasive in everyday life, and with the publication of large language models such as ChatGPT especially relevant in the context of media and public communication. This paper synthesizes the conceptualizations, types, methods, and evaluations of AI in public communication in the early phases of innovation adoption, before the broad public discussion around generative AI set in. We conducted a systematic review of empirical research focusing on AI in six social and computing-science databases up until and including 2022 (k = 198). Results show a steep increase in the number of studies published on AI in public communication in just four years. To facilitate a common understanding of what AI is and how it is studied, AI applications are grouped into four AI types: (a) AI as method, (b) Generative AI, (c) AI as communicator, and (d) AI generally. People’s interaction with and attitudes towards AI seem to be central in this research. In addition, AI has mostly been investigated with quantitative methods, often with human participants, as evidenced by the dominance of surveys and experiments. The reviewed research primarily comes from English-speaking countries and often fails to define what AI is or to formulate normative implications. Five blind spots of AI research in public communication and their implications for future empirical studies are discussed.",

          "authors": "Jiyoung Lee, Jiyoun Suk",
          "abstract": "In the current media landscape, misinformation has evolved into a multimodal challenge, presenting misinformation through various modalities simultaneously, particularly through text and visuals. Despite increasing scholarly attention to visual misinformation, as one type of multimodal misinformation, there is a lack of a unified theoretical framework for understanding the cognitive processes involved in how people process visual misinformation and become susceptible to it. In this paper, we introduce a psychological processing model—the Visual Misinformation Processing Model (VMPM)—to bridge this gap. This model outlines four key cognitive stages: (1) encountering visual misinformation; (2) allocating attention to visuals; (3) engaging in dominant processing of visuals alongside text; and (4) becoming persuaded by misinformation. We discuss the current state of research on visual misinformation and suggest directions for future research.",

          "abstract": "As social beings, we humans are driven to connect, and not only to fellow humans. We readily develop emotional connections toward “beings” that are in fact not humans, demonstrated by millennia-old fascinations with fictional characters. More recently observed with technologies capable of socially engaging as artificial others, responding almost as if they were humans themselves. As these technologies advance, digital and robotic entities become more proficient at offering assistance and to satisfy our need to connect and establish meaningful relationships. This article reviews and integrates literature from various fields to examine the key concepts and psycho-social mechanisms underlying relationship formation between humans and artificial others, specifically focusing on social robots. The resulting theoretical framework, the theory of affective bonding (TAB), seeks to explain how, when and why people would bond to non-human entities or social robots, building on four key propositions. This coherent multi-disciplinary framework may advance the field and guide future research in human–robot communication and relationship formation over time.",

          "authors": "Clara Juarez Miro, Phoebe Maares, Jonathan Hendrickx, Folker Hanusch",
          "abstract": "Digitalization and declines in news use underscore the tension between journalistic ideals of detachment and audience communities’ demands for journalistic actors’ engagement. This is enhanced by the emergence of non-traditional actors who can effectively assert journalistic authority within communities by deviating from specific traditional journalistic values. However, scholarly understanding of the role of community membership in claims of journalistic authority remains limited. To address this, we propose a theoretical framework that draws on boundary work and fan studies. This framework allows us to examine how diverse journalistic actors in a variety of communities can base their journalistic authority claims on their: (1) proximity to news sources and protagonists; (2) authenticity as perceived by the audience community; and (3) professionalism in relation to the journalistic field. Through empirical research, this framework may help us to better understand how diverse journalistic actors can claim authority while meeting communities’ diverse needs.",

          "authors": "Liang Ge",
          "abstract": "This study examines the struggling lived experiences of women workers in the Chinese audio drama industry, through a mixed-methods approach involving online and on-site observations, as well as multi-round interviews with voice actors, and technical and administrative professionals from seven distinct Chinese audio drama crews. I reveal a pronounced process – the feminization of labor – within this burgeoning creative sector. The feminization of labor, understood here as a constant process of invisibility and vulnerability . Within the Chinese audio drama industry, female workers are stuck in invisibility, frequently find themselves relegated to backstage roles, and subject to an inflexible flexibility whereby work is discursively overloaded and becomes inextricably linked with life, while their male colleagues occupy more prominent and supervisory positions. Despite contributing creatively, women’s efforts often go unnoticed and are rendered invisible. Then by spotlighting the challenges faced by female voice actresses and audio drama professionals, I explicate the systemic gender biases, which result in women receiving limited opportunities, lower incomes, and reduced visibility compared to their male counterparts. I argue that the current state of gender inequality is a consequence of deeply ingrained binary gender beliefs that shape the choices of voice actors in audio dramas, along with uneven progress across various genres, including danmei , heterosexual romances, and female-female romances, stemming from the entrenched Chinese hetero-patriarchal socio-familial system and the party-state’s heteronormative censorship practices.",

          "abstract": "This Special Issue was conceived in an important year for democracy – 2024 – when an estimated 1.5bn people headed to the polls. What we now know, and indeed could have predicted because of the way in which national elections held in the first half of the 2020s were already showing an alarming lurch to the right, was that the super-election year resulted in another significant triumph for populism which was too often accompanied by overtly anti-feminist positions ( Korolczuk et al., 2025 ). The European elections did indeed deliver this outcome across a number of countries, often overturning a solid left-leaning polity; Donald Trump's win in the US Presidential election in November 2024 further consolidated the trend, not just in terms of populist politics but also demonstrating a racist kickback, re-traditionalisation of gender norms and a backlash against feminism and feminists. In Trump's inauguration speech, he said, ‘This week, I will [also] end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life’ and subsequently repealed 78 executive orders signed by Joe Biden, including measures which supported racial equity and which combatted discrimination against gay and transgender people ( https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-sign-orders-ending-diversity-programs-proclaiming-there-are-only-two-sexes-2025-01-20/ ). As a key player on the global and media stage, Trump's regressive views on women and diversity contribute a powerful voice to the wider populist discourse and constitute a significant backlash against gender justice. As this Special Issue goes to press, Trump and his allies have double-downed on their anti-ED&amp;I stance, including bullying American universities into abandoning their ED&amp;I policies under threat of funding cuts.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The study aims to investigate how badge incentives influence systems shape longitudinal behavioral patterns in online knowledge communities. While prior research based on the goal-gradient hypothesis has documented temporary increases in user contributions preceding badge attainment, the mechanisms underlying sustained behavioral evolution remain underexplored. Design/methodology/approach We employed group-based trajectory modeling to identify distinct behavioral pattern ( N  = 2,055) through longitudinal analysis of user activity records. Users’ posting frequency before and after badge acquisition was systematically tracked to observe the steering effect across global and subgroup levels. Multinomial logistic regression analyses examined co-evolutionary relationships between behavioral trajectories and badge incentives. Findings The results reveal three key insights: 1) Badge attainment exerts time-dependent steering effects that differentially influence engagement trajectories across user subgroups. 2) The evolution of user behavior has a close positive correlation with badge incentive, in addition to being influenced by user knowledge characteristics. 3) Strategic adjustment of the number of badges rather than the overall level shows greater potential for activating low-engagement users. Originality/value This research advances incentive mechanism literature by 1) developing a dynamic framework for modeling behavioral trajectories in reward systems, 2) demonstrating heterogeneous badge effects across user segments, especially for low-engagement users and 3) proposing evidence-based guidelines for optimizing badge architectures. The findings provide actionable insights for platform designers seeking to balance engagement boosting and quality maintenance through targeted incentive engineering.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study explores digital risk perceptions – the perception of risk related to digital environments – among older adults. Specifically, it investigates how these risk perceptions influence older adults’ frequency of digital engagement in everyday activities. Design/methodology/approach The research methodology involved conducting 22 interviews and administering 708 surveys among older adults living at home. The researchers examined how digital risk perceptions influenced older adults’ frequency of engagement in everyday digital activities. The study also explored the mediating role of digital risk perceptions in the relationship between older adults’ digital competencies and the frequency of everyday digital engagement. Findings The study identified six distinct categories of digital risk perceptions among older adults. Furthermore, it found that older adults’ digital competencies significantly impacted the frequency of everyday digital engagement. However, certain digital risk perceptions, particularly those related to privacy and security concerns and concerns about financial impact, mediated the relationship between digital competencies and the frequency of everyday digital engagement. Older adults’ frequency of participating in digital activities was influenced by perceptions of risk, highlighting the complex interplay between digital competencies and digital risk perception in shaping older adults’ engagement with everyday digital activities. Originality/value This study contributes to understanding older adults’ engagement in everyday digital activities by delineating six specific categories of digital risk perceptions.

          "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to investigate tech workers’ occupational culture in China’s Internet industry and explain how the business context shapes the occupational culture. Design/methodology/approach This case study of tech workers’ occupational culture in China’s Internet industry uses focused interviews with 101 workers for data collection and qualitative coding for data analysis. Findings This research reveals two shared values, “optimising user experience” and “reliable delivering”, among Chinese tech workers and explains how the two values perpetuate their overwork norm and practices. It shows how the dominant user-oriented, go-big-or-go-home business model in China’s Internet industry urges management to bring pressure from the product market inside the work organisations to reconfigure tech workers’ occupational culture. Originality/value Extant studies on IT occupational culture (ITOC) have paid inadequate attention to how its cross-cultural variations are developed from specific social contexts. This research contributes to the literature by illustrating how ITOC in China’s Internet companies is configured in the business context of China’s Internet industry. Contrasting with existing studies that mainly emphasise ITOC as intrinsic values among information technology personnel, this article reveals how ITOC is shaped by extrinsic values from the product market.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study explores consumer experiences shaped by digital technologies, focusing on the evolving concept of “phygital” or hybrid experiences arising from the integration of virtual and physical elements. It specifically investigates the challenges of reconciling performers’ virtual immersion with the physical experiences of crowds at esports tournaments. Design/methodology/approach Using a triadic lens involving producers, performers and audiences, the study employs a comprehensive methodological approach. It combines ethnographic and netnographic data, in-depth interviews and archival data to provide a holistic understanding of the phygital experience. Findings The findings uncover the complexities of value creation and destruction in social phygital experiences. It identifies key strategies employed by producers to mediate these experiences, such as amplifying, bridging, restricting and transposing. These strategies are essential in managing the divergent expectations of performers and audiences, ensuring a cohesive and engaging experience. The findings offer a framework for understanding and managing conflicting expectations in phygital settings. Research limitations/implications Data collection focused primarily on Western esports tournaments. Future research could explore how cultural factors influence the dynamics of social phygital experiences. Practical implications The study provides actionable insights for live performance producers and marketers in esports and other industries, emphasising the need for strategic planning to balance virtual immersion with physical engagement. It highlights opportunities to leverage sensory technologies and atmospheric management to enhance phygital experiences. Originality/value This research advances the conceptualisation of phygital experiences by introducing the notion of social phygitality and demonstrating the importance of triadic management in co-located hybrid events.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Does telecommuting enhance employees’ self-leadership and thereby facilitate thriving at work? By drawing on the socially embedded model of thriving at work, we aimed to explore the interactive effect of telecommuting and perceived visionary leadership on thriving at work through the lens of self-leadership. Design/methodology/approach Two-wave survey data were collected from a sample of 230 Chinese workers. Hierarchical linear regressions were performed to test our hypotheses. Findings The results suggested that telecommuting increases employees’ thriving at work through self-leadership when receiving a high level of visionary leadership but decreases their thriving at work through self-leadership when receiving a low level of visionary leadership. Research limitations/implications By integrating leadership research with studies on telecommuting, this study not only provides a new perspective to the literature on telecommuting but also helps teleworkers overcome the challenges they face, supporting the broad application of telecommuting technologies. Practical implications As telecommuting becomes increasingly prevalent in the workplace, we provide managers with insights on how to effectively manage and engage with employees in telecommuting environments. This helps them develop strategies to sustain employee productivity and maximize the benefits of implementing teleworking. Originality/value Beyond the traditional technostress perspective within the information systems field, we offer a leadership perspective on the effects of telecommuting on employees. Specifically, our findings indicate that the impact of telecommuting on self-leadership and subsequently thriving at work – whether it is beneficial or detrimental – depends on the presence of perceived visionary leadership.",

          "authors": "Kwanho Suk, Sanyoung Hwang",
          "abstract": "Purpose Empirical findings and arguments regarding the relationship between goal level and crowdfunding performance have been inconsistent. This research seeks to clarify these inconsistencies by distinguishing crowdfunding performance into two types of performance metrics, target-based (e.g. goal success, fund-goal ratio and goal completion ratio) and fundraising-based (e.g. total raised funds, number of contributors and amount per contributor). It aims to examine how goal level differentially influences these two types of performance metrics. Design/methodology/approach A meta-analysis of published studies and analyses of crowdfunding data from two heterogeneous platforms (i.e. Kickstarter and Kakao Together) were conducted. Findings Meta-analysis and crowdfunding data analyses consistently present evidence that the type of performance metrics moderates the relationship between goal level and performance. The goal level is negatively related to target-based performance metrics, indicating that lower-level goals perform better in goal success, fund-goal ratio and goal completion ratio. On the contrary, the goal level is positively related to fundraising-based performance metrics, with higher-level goals performing better in the total raised funds, number of contributors and amount per contributor. Practical implications Findings suggest that goal setting in crowdfunding should be guided by the types of performance metrics used to define success, as these metrics are inherently shaped by the platform’s operational model (all-or-nothing vs keep-it-all). Originality/value This research addresses and resolves conflicting findings in the existing literature on the relationship between goal level and crowdfunding performance by clarifying the role of performance metrics in evaluating crowdfunding success.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to integrate the means-end chain (MEC) theory with the Kano model to better understand the preferences of female binge-watchers who demonstrate high levels of e-leisure attachment, constraints and addiction to over-the-top (OTT) video streaming services. The ultimate goal is to develop effective service design and promotional strategies. Design/methodology/approach This study investigated the OTT services using data derived from mixed-method research. A preliminary qualitative survey was conducted with 28 female interviewees to identify the questionnaire items for a subsequent survey involving 400 valid respondents. Findings The results show that all respondents considered the attributes of “copyright,” “low interference from advertising,” “quick program updates” and “easy access to frequently viewed programs” to be important factors that attract female binge-watchers using the OTT services. However, female binge-watchers with high e-leisure attachment, constraints and addiction have different perspectives on the remaining attributes. By understanding these differences, academics and practitioners can gain insights to formulate effective business strategies. Research limitations/implications This research primarily focused on female individuals aged 18–24 years; therefore, the findings of this study are limited to this specific demographic group. Practical implications The developed hierarchical value maps can assist managers, marketers and designers in the OTT media sector in formulating effective strategies for product design and marketing endeavors. Originality/value This study is the first to integrate the MEC theory with the Kano model to elucidate the cognitive hierarchies of female binge-watchers who utilize OTT services, particularly those with a strong attachment to e-leisure as well as the constraints and addiction associated with this behavior.",

          "abstract": "Communication science has been criticized for relying on WEIRD samples. One question that arises from such criticisms is whether core communication constructs and measures generalize to different demographic groups. In other words, are measures of common communication variables interpreted similarly across groups? In this study, we assess the measurement invariance of numerous scales that are used commonly in research on communication science across five U.S. racial groups, seven English-speaking countries across five continents, and four age groups that are recognized by the American Psychological Association. Results indicate that respondents from different racial, national, and age groups exhibited measurement invariance. That is, people with different backgrounds responded to scales in similar ways, thereby indicating that some core communication constructs might be generalizable across certain groups. The implications of these results are considered, while noting that the invariance framework used herein can be used to continue examining the problem of construct invariance.",

          "authors": "Ranran Z. Mi, Catalina L. Toma, Shiwei Mo",
          "abstract": "Abstract: Media task-switching refers to the act of interrupting a primary task by turning to media distractions. Using a self-control failure framework, this paper examines why and to what effect people engage in task-switching with media. We theorize that media task-switching is dually shaped by people’s motivation to perform well on the primary task and by the presence of “tempting” media. Study 1, a lab experiment ( N = 188), shows that (1) the availability of media produced task-switching, while high motivation to perform well on the primary task reduced it; (2) some media activities (i.e., Facebook browsing) improved mood, but overall, task-switching decreased mood; and (3) task-switching led to a significant drop in task performance. Study 2, a vignette-based online experiment with mixed model design ( N = 163) replicates the effect of motivation on task-switching and further examines how the effortfulness of media activities influences task-switching. In both social media use and texting context, individuals were more likely to switch to low-effort activities (e.g., browsing social media, checking messages) compared to medium-effort or high-effort activities (e.g., composing posts, initiating messages). This paper provides evidence that both psychological and media-related factors jointly shape media task-switching, and advances self-control theory by explicating the tempting characteristics of daily media use.",

          "authors": "Fabienne S. V. Wehrli, Selina A. Landolt, Katharina Weitkamp, Guy Bodenmann",
          "abstract": "Sexuality is central to well-being in many romantic relationships. Equity theory suggests that perceiving equal contributions within the relationship—presumably also within the sexual relationship—is associated with better outcomes, while a perceived imbalance may lead to distress or dissatisfaction. The current research examines whether equity of received and provided partner contributions to sexual self-esteem, as perceived by men and women, is associated with sexual satisfaction and sexual function for both partners. We conducted Dyadic Response Surface Analyses using data from 327 mixed-gender couples. Our results indicate that perceiving high, but not necessarily similar (i.e., equitable) levels of partner contributions to sexual self-esteem are associated with greater sexual satisfaction and function of both partners. When analyzing the subscales of partner contributions to sexual self-esteem, i.e. partner contributions to sexual self-worth and sexual self-efficacy, separately, we found a broad equity effect between received and provided sexual self-worth and sexual satisfaction for both partners. This means, that equality in received and provided sexual self-worth is associated with higher sexual satisfaction compared to when inequality is perceived. Additionally, perceived overbenefit in partner contributions to sexual self-efficacy in men was linked to lower sexual function in men. Our findings have implications for research and practice and suggest that gendered sexual scripts should be considered alongside equity theory when conducting research on sexual health in couples.",

We offer a synthesis of 339 articles measuring similarity and relationship outcomes in established romantic relationships. We report trends in extant research regarding domains of similarity, methods of calculating similarity, and sample characteristics. Our findings showed generally mixed results when examining the association between similarity and relationship outcomes. This trend remained consistent across different similarity types and measurement methods, though stronger effects were found for perceived as opposed to actual similarity. Thus, despite popular belief, similarity does not seem to be universally associated with superior relationship outcomes. Future research should incorporate more diverse samples, holistic measures of similarity, and advanced statistical techniques and should explore specific situations where similarity might be crucial.",

Self-determination theory provides a framework to explore the links between relational power and different types of sexual motivations. Data were taken from 1,668 newly married couples that participated in three waves of the nationally representative CREATE study. Using an Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM) framework, this study examined how perceptions of shared relationship power were associated with both partners’ harmonious and inhibited sexual passion, and whether connections were mediated by partners’ sexual autonomy. Results demonstrated that for both partners, a sense of shared power was predictive of greater harmonious sexual passion and less inhibited sexual passion over time. Although concurrent indirect effects were found for both partners, no longitudinal indirect effects were significant. These findings highlight the importance of both partners feeling that they have influence in the relationship for both partners’ sexual well-being.",

However, the rollout of AI is not without risk. This work explores the use of AI in federal rulemaking, the process by which regulations are introduced and revised.

However, these platforms also attract volumes of opinion spam that attempt to influence regulatory decision-making. Using AI to identify opinion spam may offer a potential remedy, but removing or limiting comments with the help of AI may threaten rulemaking legitimacy. This research uses the situational theory of problem-solving as a framework, segmenting publics based on their problem recognition, constraints, and involvement with a specific issue, then predicting how each public behaves. We examined how employing AI in the processing of rulemaking comments affects public segments’ intention to comment, their perceptions of legitimacy of the resulting rules, trust in agencies, and control mutuality between the public and the agency. This work describes two controlled, randomized experiments (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 149; &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 250) that capture public segments’ reactions to AI use in analyzing comments in the presence or absence of opinion spam. We show that public segmentation is a key aspect in shaping attitudes and behaviors regarding the use of AI for e-rulemaking purposes. These findings suggest that communicating effectively with publics is essential for agencies, and that the use of AI does not make the publics’ attitudes differ.",

          "authors": "Simon M. Luebke, Nadezhda Ozornina, Mario Haim, Jörg Haßler",
          "abstract": "Climate change is a major political challenge affecting millions of people worldwide. Journalists—while following media logic—have a strong responsibility to inform the public of the scientific evidence on the causes and consequences of climate change and to explain the motivations driving the climate policies under discussion. However, within hybrid media systems, journalists increasingly compete for attention with climate stakeholders, who tend to follow a political logic in climate communication and bypass journalism to share their perspectives on climate change. Despite this dynamic, the extent to which the climate communication of media organizations and stakeholders diverges in terms of content and focus remains largely unexplored, as does whether their topics and communication styles show signs of convergence. This article addresses these gaps by comparing how journalistic media and climate stakeholders communicate about climate change on social media and by examining the user engagement their content creates. We conducted a manual quantitative content analysis of visual posts about climate change published by media organizations and climate stakeholders in Germany on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube during the 2023 UN Climate Change Conference in Dubai (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 1,050). The results deepen our understanding of the national climate discourse in Germany and show that journalistic content in climate communication adheres strongly to media logic, presenting climate change in a more event-oriented, personalized, and negative manner. However, climate stakeholders’ communication is characterized by political logic, using strategic framing and focusing less on current climate events.",

          "abstract": "Digital technologies have become ubiquitous infrastructures worldwide, with WhatsApp emerging as one of the most widely used apps, particularly in the Global South. However, its integration into rural and Indigenous contexts in Latin America remains relatively unexplored. The Jujuy Puna, situated in Northwest Argentina and home to Quechua communities, recently gained internet connectivity through state initiatives. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in two villages, Cusi Cusi and Lagunillas del Farallón, this paper examines the use of WhatsApp in these communities. Furthermore, it investigates the intricate dynamics of WhatsApp usage within the realms of kinship and caregiving. To comprehend this phenomenon, we mobilize the concept of kinship to encompass and explain the myriad practices through which individuals in these villages establish connections and preserve a sense of collectivity using digital technologies like WhatsApp.",

          "abstract": "Older age cohorts have been found to exhibit both less interest and less use of digital technologies than younger cohorts, which suggests that they may be less flexible in comparison to younger technology users. However, frequency is not the only differentiating factor between age groups in the context of mobile technology use, as the specific ways in which technologies are used also play a significant role in the daily lives of older adults (65+). Drawing on the selective optimization with compensation (SOC) model, we ask what strategies older adults use to enhance their subjective well-being when using mobile technologies. The thematic analysis is based on 20 elicitation interviews conducted in Central Finland in 2018. Our findings suggest that mobile technologies can act as both a tool to enhance well-being and a source of problems for older adults, and that older adults show considerable creativity in navigating various mobile, digital and non-digital strategies. Furthermore, we argue that these evolving, and thus also in this sense mobile, strategies contribute to the subjective well-being and successful ageing of older adults by providing them with “workarounds” to manage mobile technologies to their benefit.",

          "abstract": "In today's digitally saturated world, mobile apps, particularly smartphone apps, have become indispensable for managing various aspects of life, including efforts to reduce digital media consumption. This study explores digital-disconnection apps as sociotechnical artifacts, examining their place within the self-helped disconnection trend and the broader app ecosystems such as app stores. Through a mixed-methods approach, 55 relevant apps were identified, with 20 app descriptions and 1,193 user reviews analyzed using descriptive statistics and thematic coding. The findings reveal that “Productivity” and “Health &amp; Fitness” are the two dominant categories for these apps. While both emphasize mindfulness, habit formation, and personalized dis/engagement, they differ in the problems they address, the alternatives they encourage, and the contexts in which they are used. User reviews highlight concerns about app functionality, with technical and financial barriers revealed. This study sheds light on the gap between the idealized smartphone use and non-use promoted by app publishers, and the practical challenges experienced by users. Furthermore, this study contributes to the growing studies on technologies such as apps serving digital disconnection and well-being purposes, intertwining it with critical examinations of self-help culture within a digital framework.",

This study adopts an integrative media effects framework and a nationally representative sample of Czech adolescents (11–16 years old, N = 2500, 50% girls) to investigate: (1) the associations between depression, loneliness, self-esteem, happiness, sensation seeking, age and gender, and the different types of sexting behavior (both expected and unexpected receiving and sending of sexts); and (2) the role of individual factors in feeling happy and upset after different types of sexting. While we found a similar pattern for the associations of individual factors with engagement in the three sexting behaviors, we found no pattern for the associations across the outcomes (i.e. feeling happy and upset). Our findings show that the outcomes of sexting must be researched as individual behaviors, not as one “sexting” behavior.",

Failure to include children causes lacunae in our understanding of the factors that influence their lives and well-being. In this article, we propose to conceptualise approaches to including children in research along four dimensions: Exclusion; Exploitation; Extension; and Empowerment. Using research on children’s experiences with online sexual content as a case, we discuss ethical dilemmas related to including children in research. Finally, we present 10 recommendations for future research to respect children’ agency and empower them to participate in research in an ethically responsible manner.",

Concerns and calls for further regulation and youth’s self-regulation are exacerbated when celebrities and popular public figures share statements and confessions about their own sexual lives at a young age. In this article, we study the discursive conditions of media coverage and the celebrity confessional as narratives of regulation and self-regulation. Using Billie Eilish’s statement about her self-perceived experience of harm from use of pornography during teenage life (13 December 2021), we study how global and national media outlets constructed Eilish’s confession in the light of broader concerns about children’s experiences with such online sexual content. This study enhances our understanding of how adolescents’ experiences of sexual content online is publicly shaped.",

I ask: How do cultural transitions and intercultural encounters influence people’s perceptions of their algorithms? How do key issues regarding algorithmic production get translated and reinterpreted? Based on 50 semi-structured interviews with Israelis who immigrated to Silicon Valley, I show that their interpretation of the cultural differences between Israeli and Silicon Valley cultures—and their culturally specific logic of difference —informs how they perceive the algorithms they develop and their ethical implications. I argue that these perceptions stem from deep-seated cultural tropes but are also potentially ameliorated by their encounter with Silicon Valley’s culture. Thus, this article calls for a more diverse view of Silicon Valley’s ideologies, showing that attention to cross-cultural encounters can both reveal and complicate the performative logics sustaining Silicon Valley’s liberal image.",

          "abstract": "In 2010, the EU Kids Online project, and aligned AU Kids Online study, interviewed one parent and one child (9–16) from 25,542 families across 26 countries. Information gathered included parents’ awareness of their child’s experiences of sexual content online. This dataset has since been updated by recent ethnographic work in Australia and Ireland, capturing parents’ approaches to managing their children’s (11–17) digital engagement with sexual content. Parents identified risks and benefits in their children’s encounters with adult content online. This article concludes that parents do not judge the efficacy of their digital parenting around preventing their child from seeing restricted 18+ content or, indeed, knowing whether their child has encountered sexual content online. Instead, they adopt a nuanced approach that reflects knowledge of their child and the child’s relative maturity, with a view to supporting their child’s progressive development towards full digital and sexual citizenship.",

          "abstract": "Porn studies have a long tradition of researching porn as a cultural artifact in relation to adult audiences. Recently, there has been increasing interest in young people’s uses and perceptions of porn since there is a general concern about its possible harms and dangers. This article aims to shed light on these issues through an ethnographic study carried out in Barcelona and its metropolitan area. Our main objective is to understand how teenagers and young people use, experience, and give meaning to the porn content they consume. We applied a bottom-up approach that brings the real and everyday experiences of young people to the discussion. The results focus on three areas: the spatial, temporal, and media context in which young people approach porn; their own interpretations of pornographic content, considering gender differences; and the double preventive and educational view young people extract from porn.",

Thirteen male adolescents, 14 to 15 years old, were interviewed using in-depth interviews to understand their perspectives of risk and harm. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify three pertinent themes: pornography is risky and harmful, especially to naïve consumers; pornography is not harmful to me, because strategies of control can be used; and generational disparity, where differences between adult claims of harm and personal experiences were questioned. We propose adolescents’ concern for others’ wellbeing over their personal risks be considered as showing compassion. We conclude that adolescent perceptions of risk and harm are nuanced and insightful, and that adolescents can engage critically with pornography content to manage potential risks and harm.",

Public discourse often oversimplifies the intricate relationship between adolescents and online pornography. The prevailing narrative tends to portray pornography as detrimental to health and well-being, relying on a limited exposure and effects model that fails to grasp its nuanced significance in young lives. Online pornography, easily accessible to young individuals, is criticised for potentially replacing informative sex education with representations of violent and risky relationships. Employing media and cultural studies tools, this research positions porn consumption within the broader context of new mediated intimacies. The study aims to unravel how young Italians (15- to 18-year-olds) perceive and interpret harms in relation to online pornography. Findings reveal that despite a critical perspective, many participants maintain stereotypical views on gender and age dynamics, reflecting broader societal discourses about effects and addiction.",

Based on a scoping review of 46 studies published between January 2011 and June 2024, we identify how scholarly attention has concentrated on Islam and Muslim minorities, often in the context of mediatised conflict, securitisation, or cultural tension. The studies commonly focus on practices through which mainstream media underplays religious complexity and reproduces tensions between democratic ideals, such as freedom of religion and freedom of speech. While some studies address non-institutional actors and new media platforms, these remain relatively underexplored in Nordic literature engaging in the intersection of religion, media, and democracy. This scoping review highlights gaps in current scholarship and calls for broader engagement with how religion modulates and structures democratic participation, as well as closer attention to emerging media environments and non-institutional religiosity.",

However, the psychometric properties of the partner version of the PDST have yet to be assessed. Across four studies ( N = 1134), we tested whether PSS (1) were associated with relationship and, to a lesser degree, personal well‐being, (2) offered predictive utility compared to self‐schema structures, and (3) represented a distinct construct from attachment orientations. PSS were correlated with relationship well‐being indices (i.e., relationship commitment, adjustment, satisfaction, quality, as well as causal and responsibility attributions) and, to a lesser extent, personal well‐being indices (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress), supporting its convergent validity. Hierarchical regression models revealed that, generally, PSS adds predictive utility to relationship but not personal well‐being after controlling for self‐schema structures. Finally, PSS were weakly correlated with attachment orientations and explained additional variance in relationship well‐being above and beyond attachment, supporting its divergent validity. We conclude that the partner version of the PDST is a useful tool for assessing partner schema structures.",

Semi‐structured interviews were conducted with 19 people with OUD and CJI. Participants defined friendships as instrumental , individualistic , risky , altruistic , and temporary .

          "authors": "Amarasinghe Arachchige Don Nalin Samandika Saparamadu, Oshozimhede E. Iyalomhe, Lawrence L. Cheskin",
          "abstract": "The phrase “I believe in science” presents a paradox, blending subjective belief with the evidence-based scientific method. Science is a dynamic, self-correcting process driven by empiricism, falsifiability, and peer review. However, the phrase often reflects trust in institutions rather than direct engagement with the scientific process and its elements. This paper explores how framing science as an iterative process, rather than a set of absolute truths, can improve evidence-based communication. Emphasizing methodology over belief can promote critical engagement with scientific discourse, resolving the paradox and promoting a deeper public understanding of science as an evolving pursuit of knowledge.",

          "abstract": "Scientists increasingly use generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to aid in science communication tasks due to limited time and resources. GenAI can function as a writing assistant, idea generator, or collaborative tool. While it offers promising support, it is crucial to address potential pitfalls, such as misinformation due to its stochastic nature, dependency on prompt specificity, and the risk of reproducing biases and stereotypes. To mitigate these issues, scientists should be trained in competencies that foster ethical and effective interactions with GenAI, ensuring they develop what we call “Good Working Habits” for science communication with GenAI.",

          "authors": "Claudia Gerhards",
          "abstract": "Since social media influencers have become popular and monetize their content with the help of advertising deals, they have been associated with morally questionable, deceptive behavior. The list of misconduct is long. It includes, for example, not disclosing sponsored content, withholding negative experiences with promoted products, buying fake followers, and promoting false ideals of beauty. Building on the concept of “dirty work” as a theoretical framework, this article asks which strategies influencers use to soften this moral taint. Qualitative interviews with influencers living in Germany show that they are aware of their negative image in public and use various stigma management strategies. This article offers a perspective that has not yet played a role in the ethics debate about influencers. It asks how influencers, who are often associated with morally questionable practices, immunize themselves against this negative image and find a positive work identity.",

          "abstract": "Sharing memes has emerged as a prevalent form of social grooming behavior on digital platforms, yet research has largely focused on the content of internet memes rather than the behavior of sharing them. This study explores whether sharing memes with different humor styles (affiliative, self-enhancing, aggressive, and self-defeating humor styles) relates to subjective well-being through the mediating roles of online bonding and bridging social capital. Using survey data from a representative sample of 1000 participants in the United States, the findings showed that affiliative and aggressive meme-sharing were positively associated with psychological well-being and positive feelings via enhanced online bonding social capital. The findings could contribute to a deeper understanding of social and psychological implications of engaging with memes in online communication.",

          "authors": "Elena Maris, Mel Monier",
          "abstract": "In this article, we critically analyze TikTok videos related to the #MelaninMansion trend and the #BlackTikTokStrike. Videos analyzed were posted during the hashtags’ peak engagement, 2019–2020, and the summer of 2021, respectively. Drawing from Black cyberfeminism and literatures on Black cyberculture, platform politics, visibility, affect, resistance, refusal, and copyright, we identified shared themes and thematic differences between the hashtags. Based on these findings, we argue #MelaninMansion and #BlackTikTokStrike illustrate two significant moments on TikTok for Black creators, and a marked change in their tactical and affective response to on-platform racism, appropriation, and content theft. We contend the messaging and imaginings found in the videos reveal Black TikTok’s negative experiences on-platform and their understanding of potential technological and policy solutions. We especially note the affective change during the strike, where Black TikTok creators turn from humorous utopian imaginings of on-platform equity and celebrations of Blackness and community, to frustrated refusal of on-platform labor and pessimistic reflections on the (im)possibilities for Black content creation. Despite the sharp turn in tactics and expectations, content from both moments reflects a commitment to Black joy and intracommunity support. We argue our findings reveal how the TikTok platform and non-Black TikTok community together create a toxic technoculture rife with the violence of racism, cultural appropriation, and creative theft. Finally, we note the centrality of Black women to these viral moments, how #BlackTikTokStrike especially centered Black women’s labor and creativity, and that despite this, Black women performed an outsized amount of labor during the strike.",

          "authors": "Caitlin Hogan",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the social meaning of softblocking, a practice on social media in which a user blocks and then immediately unblocks another user, causing a mutual unfollowing. This study finds that softblocking highlights that social media users exercise agency in creating imagined affordances through novel use of pre-installed features to do social work. It also discusses what the rise of softblocking suggests about the demand for reciprocity within social media interaction. With a corpus of 96,541 tweets mentioning softblocking from 2009 to 2020 and corpus-assisted discourse analysis, this study explores (1) how softblocking is differentiated from pre-packaged affordances, (2) how softblocking is negotiated metadiscursively, and (3) how expectations of reciprocity are addressed by softblocking. I find that users expect sustained interaction and value-sharing with those they are in mutual following relationships with and also expect these relationships to be broken reciprocally. This study argues that softblocking meets the demand for disconnective action in a mutual manner, in line with emerging norms of politeness on social media that see reciprocity as politeness.",

          "title": "Doing the Lord’s Work: Deconstructing Fundamentalist Christianity Through Cathartic Anti-Fandom on Reddit",
          "authors": "Caitlin E. Lawson, Cecilia R. Hafferty",
          "abstract": "r/fundiesnarkuncensored is a Reddit community that monitors and critiques fundamentalist Christian, namely evangelical, content creators. Many members of the community were formerly conservative Christians who have since deconstructed some or all of their beliefs. This study approaches “fundie snarkers,” particularly those who have deconstructed, through the lenses of anti-fandom and affect theory, to deepen our understanding of anti-fandom as a simultaneously ideological and affective phenomenon. Through individual, semi-structured interviews with 20 members of r/fundiesnarkuncensored, we explore the role that “fundie snarking” plays in members’ deconstruction journeys and vice versa. Participants organized content on the subreddit into three categories based on their affective and intellectual responses to that content: petty snark, or superficial critiques that participants find both guiltily pleasurable and frustratingly rude; structural snark, or systemic critiques of fundamentalism that participants universally esteem; and dark snark, or content that participants find too distressing to engage. Taken together, this “structure of snark” reveals the ambiguity of their anti-fandom by emphasizing that participants have empathy for the fundies they criticize and see the subreddit’s ideal purpose as a tool for deconstruction. Ultimately, through our discussion of the gratifications participants obtain through their engagement with the subreddit, we propose an additional form of anti-fandom: cathartic anti-fandom. Cathartic anti-fandom involves the dislike and critique of ideologies, practices, and communities in which the anti-fan formerly participated and/or by which they were harmed. By filtering fundamentalist Christian teaching through critical commentary and making these ideologies laughable, r/fundiesnarkuncensored provides an accessible and enjoyable space for members to unlearn harmful ideologies.",
