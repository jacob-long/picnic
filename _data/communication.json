          "authors": "Alexander Vandewalle, Richard Cole",
          "abstract": "The various ways that players actually play historical games, and how history – or players’ conceptualization thereof – impacts play processes, remains understudied in the field of historical game studies. This study investigates how players make decisions in historical games, and assesses to what extent such choices are directed by historical considerations or ideas of history. Specifically, we examined this through the perspective of ergodic characterization, or players’ nontrivial involvement in the characterization of their in-game character. We conducted an active play experiment where Classics students from Belgium and the United Kingdom ( n = 10) played Assassin’s Creed Odyssey ( Ubisoft Quebec, 2018 ) for eight weeks and reported on their experiences through questionnaires, note-taking, and focus group interviews. We found that players’ characterization decisions in historical games were driven by four play interests: ludic (i.e., characterization based on the gameplay advantages that choices might bring, or to test out specific affordances of the game system), prosthetic (characterization as an extension of the player’s own personality), narrative (characterization based on the character’s narrative and background), and referential (characterization in reference to other characters, including historical ones). We also report other findings related to characterization and the role of history in historical game experiences. This article offers new insights into player experiences of historical games, contributes empirical data to existing research on characterization in games, and advocates for active play as a research method in historical game studies.",

          "abstract": "Smart TVs, which enable unprecedented viewing data to be collected at device level, are reconfiguring business practices in television advertising and audience measurement. Using a video fingerprinting technology known as automated content recognition (ACR), most smart TVs can now recognize virtually all content displayed on the TV screen, allowing precise targeting and re-targeting of ads to users based on their viewing behaviour and prior ad exposure. This article examines how TV manufacturers including Samsung, LG and Vizio integrated ACR technology into their businesses between 2012 and 2022. Drawing on infrastructural theories of connected TV and digital advertising, I show how ACR has contributed to TV manufacturers’ wider goal of becoming digital ad platforms, shifting the underlying power structures of both the consumer electronics and television advertising industries.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the paradigm shift in the film and animation industry driven by the advent of real-time rendering technology. Through an approach combining qualitative interviews with industry practitioners and quantitative analysis of survey data, the study delves into the multifaceted impact of this technology. The research highlights the technology’s potential to enhance creativity, speed, and efficiency in production, while also emphasizing the challenges it poses, including technical complexities and the need for specialized knowledge. A notable theme of democratization emerges, with participants indicating that real-time rendering can help make high-quality production tools more accessible and enable a broader range of creators to participate in the industry. This study also reflects on the complexities of technological democratization, emphasizing that access to real-time tools remains uneven and shaped by broader structural factors.",

          "abstract": "This study conducts a conceptual replication and extension of prior research on overconfidence in discerning political misinformation, shifting focus to health. Using data from a national survey of American adults linked to web-browsing records (N=593), we investigated the prevalence and correlates of overconfidence in this domain. Consistent with earlier findings, overconfidence was most pronounced among low-performing individuals, replicating the “Dunning–Kruger Effect.” However, decomposition analyses revealed that the associations between overconfidence and behavioral correlates—exposure to low-credibility health websites and belief in cancer-related misinformation—are primarily accounted for by deficits in actual discernment ability rather than a lack of metacognitive insight. This replication highlights the robustness of the link between poor discernment and behavioral outcomes across domains. These results highlight the need for interventions that improve evaluation skills or address underlying dispositional factors, such as distrust in science and conspiracist worldviews.",

          "abstract": "This article analyzes how streaming users in Latin America experience time in relation to platforms. Drawing on a mixed-methods approach that employed daily reports of platform usage, focus groups, and “rich picture” analysis, we examine the cases of two countries with some of the highest digital media usage statistics in Latin America: Brazil and Costa Rica. We conceptualize platform users in these countries as “temporal publics,” defined by their varied experiences of time and the complexity of their “time work” practices. The article discusses how individuals engage in recalibration practices to navigate the temporal ambivalences of everyday life and what they perceive as the power of streaming platforms to control their time. By doing so, we demonstrate how users simultaneously reproduce and subvert specific temporal orders through their everyday interactions with streaming services, reflecting a sustained and intentional ambivalence toward the platforms’ power.",

This article seeks to address this gap. Rather than just a synonym for shift or change, I define trend as a temporally bounded, dynamic pattern of observable change and argue that such a concept deserves greater prominence within the study of media and communication. In addition to this definition, I theorize trends by characterizing the trend’s key features, exploring its relationship to media, and mapping its connection to questions that animate media and communication research. The case of “brat summer” of 2024 is offered as an exemplary case from which trend’s core features may be discerned. The article’s primary contribution is to advance the trend as a central concept through which communication and media studies researchers may think more comprehensively and critically about change.",

          "abstract": "The rapid dissemination of misinformation has raised concerns about its persistence despite corrective efforts, as the influence of fact-checking often diminishes quickly. This study explores “time” as a central theoretical and methodological construct in understanding the effects of fact-checking interventions. Across two large-scale, pre-registered panel experiments (N = 6,983), we examine the temporal dynamics of both the persuasive and unintended consequences of factual corrections. Results show that while fact-checks yield immediate belief updating, their effects largely fade within two weeks and do not produce durable belief echoes. In Study 2, we introduce a novel design treating time lag as an experimental treatment and show that simple interventions aimed at increasing the temporal accessibility of corrections—termed “accuracy reminders”—significantly extend the durability of their effects. These findings reconceptualize correction effects as inherently temporal processes, advancing communication theory and offering scalable, time-sensitive strategies for sustaining the influence of fact-checking in dynamic information environments.",

Specifically, our study examines how differences in two perceived affordances—persistence and visibility—affect how women viewers evaluate the authenticity of men who post allyship messages on Instagram. Additionally, we examine how viewer perceptions of comment deletion and comment restriction impact source evaluations. Results indicate that greater perceived persistence and visibility led women viewers to rate ostensible allies as more authentic and less self-interested. Moreover, comment deletion and restriction were found to partially affect how viewers evaluated ally authenticity and motive, providing additional support to warranting theory. Implications for promoting prosocial messaging and digital allyship online are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Esports has reached revenue numbers that rival traditional international sports leagues, and hundreds of esports podcasts have emerged. Using a population demography and audio clips from the introductions of 25 established esports podcasts, this study examines how processes of isomorphism and assemblage have been used by esports podcasters to build normative, cognitive, and sociopolitical legitimacy both for their shows and the genre. We found that esports podcasts introductions borrow elements of traditional sports journalism and talk radio, as well as “talkier” styles and elements of “podcastness” from newer media. At the same time, esports podcasters seem to move away from professional radio broadcast styles as their shows mature, signaling the development of unique professional norms in the podcast space.",

          "authors": "Huu Dat Tran, Pham Phuong Uyen Diep, Hayley Booth",
          "abstract": "Our study examines how external factors, including media exposure, personal values, and media framing (i.e. national security vs free speech), influence non-users’ support for a national TikTok ban in the United States via an online experiment-embedded survey ( N = 498). Results show that while perceived national security threats predicted ban support only in the national security condition, concerns about free speech violations consistently decreased support across all conditions. An analysis of open-ended responses further demonstrated that participants adopted the framing language consistent with their experimental condition. Findings suggest that personal value framing in the media, especially those related to free speech values, plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion on social media regulation policies. We thus contribute to a comprehensive understanding of how media framing influences policy preferences for emerging digital governance issues such as social media regulations. Other implications were also discussed.",

          "abstract": "Platform governance is simultaneously a matter of public concern and a professional calling for Trust and Safety, the nascent field tasked with setting and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior on digital platforms. Yet we know little about how the growing professionalization of platform governance shapes content moderation practices. Using the schema of content abuse from the Trust &amp; Safety Professional Association, we analyzed the Community Guidelines of 12 diverse livestreaming platforms. Our findings reveal significant alignment between professional guidelines and industry practices, which is especially pronounced for Twitch and YouTube. However, industry standards only partially address the policies of adult camming platforms and AfreecaTV, a Korean-based livestreaming service, revealing notable absences in how Trust and Safety imagines the boundaries of the industry. We reflect on the priorities and exclusions of emerging industry standards and conclude with a call for academics and practitioners to broaden the conversation around content moderation.",

          "abstract": "In this introduction to the special issue, we discuss the reasons why it is difficult to orientate oneself about key results in research. Some general characteristics of research in humanities and social sciences are discussed as well as characteristics that are evident in research on media and communication. With this as a point of departure, we argue that scholars have a responsibility to support actors outside academia to acquire research-based knowledge. This must be done at an arm’s-length distance, however. We argue that one way to fulfil this responsibility is to produce literature reviews with an ambition to provide a clear answer to the question “What do we know about…?” This special issue includes eight such reviews and it is a way for Nordicom to actively contribute to the supply of science-based knowledge in media policy processes in the Nordic countries.",

          "authors": "Stephen A. Rains, Kevin Coe, Kate Kenski, Yotam Shmargad",
          "abstract": "Drawing from dynamic systems theory, we examine how incivility is collectively constructed in an online discussion community. Using secondary data consisting of comments shared over a 3-week period to an online news community, we identified three sequences that reflect collective incivility practices. Whereas the persistent incivility sequence included a large proportion of uncivil comments, incivility occurred infrequently in the sporadic incivility sequence and not at all in the no incivility sequence. Once the persistent incivility or sporadic incivility sequences appeared, discussions were more likely to return to these sequences than the no incivility sequence. Contrary to our predictions, sequences containing incivility shaped discussion processes by depressing explicit expressions of agreement and disagreement. The results of this study demonstrate how the collective behavior of online community members contributes to the production and effects of incivility.",

          "authors": "Camille Alloing, Elsa Fortant, Julien Pierre, Fabien Richert, Rémi Palisser",
          "abstract": "Since their inception, social media platforms have continuously developed innovations and discourses centered on affective and emotional dimensions. Platform owners invest heavily in research and development to both identify and elicit feelings and emotions. However, the research conducted by these companies on this topic remains understudied. In this study, we present a systematic and critical analysis of the scientific literature published by the research teams of Meta (Facebook, Instagram) and Google (YouTube) regarding the analysis and processing of their users’ emotions. We first demonstrate that this literature relies on schematic definitions of emotions, thereby simplifying the complexity of affective phenomena for facilitating their automated detection. We then highlight the objectives pursued by these research efforts, the majority of which aim to promote users’ well-being through the instrumentalization of what affects them. Finally, we examine the various methods employed to identify emotions, which primarily serve to feed these platforms’ machine learning algorithms with data labeled as emotional. Beyond their scientific contributions, we consider these studies as narratives targeted at the scientific community and investors, serving to legitimize and support the development of specific innovations. Analyzing these works enables us to examine how the techniques, methods, and applications developed by these two companies commodify emotions and actively shape users’ online behaviors.",
