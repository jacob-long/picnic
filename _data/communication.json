          "authors": "Katharine Dommett",
          "abstract": "Modern election campaigning is often described as “data-driven,” but there are signs that data may not always inform decision-making. This article focuses on the decision-making component of campaigns and provides a new theorisation of this previously neglected component of data-driven campaigns. Arguing that decision-making is affected by a range of contextual, agential and organizational factors, I call for qualitative analysis of campaign practice that is needed to understand how decisions are made. Applying this theoretical account, I consider the likely future of election campaigning, reflecting particularly on the potential for automation. Specifically, I identify where automation is likely to emerge and conclude that rote-like decision-making is unlikely to entirely define the practices of future campaigns. Collectively this article offers new theoretical insight into an overlooked aspect of modern campaigning - decision-making - and provides offers a foundation for more accurate predictions about the future of campaigns.",

          "authors": "Xinxin Huang, Kun Tan",
          "abstract": "This study focuses on the Chinese micro-drama industry, conceptualizing its cultural production as a new form of traffic game – the conversion game. Distinct from the subscription and visibility games, the conversion game operates on a production logic aimed at short-term commercial monetization. Based on methods including production ethnography and in-depth interviews, this study finds that the conversion game is a closed-loop system centered on conversion rates: creatively, it employs data-driven recombination of motifs; narratively, it engineers emotional conversion through gratification points and paywalled cliffhangers; operationally, it relies on a horse-racing mechanism for high-speed mass production; and ultimately, its outcome is determined by a distribution game where ‘distribution is king’. This study challenges the ‘control-resistance’ binary, revealing how the state, platforms, and creators, in their shared pursuit of traffic, form a coupled structure that is functionally interdependent yet marked by a power imbalance. This paper theorizes the conversion game as an extreme form of platform capitalism. By systematically uncovering its operational mechanisms and power dynamics, it offers a new perspective for a critical understanding of the evolutionary trends in the global digital cultural industries.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the phenomenon and practices of making vocal home automation through an ethnographic study of the emergent relations between domestic digital voice assistants (DVAs), older users and their homes. Inspired by the concept of infrastructure in science and technology studies, and an understanding of voice from sound studies, we analyse the interrelated and emergent processes of bringing voices, users and homes into being as new DVAs are being implemented into private homes. Through this lens, we develop the empirical-analytical concept of vocal infrastructuring, which works to demystify the voice as a natural and neutral user interface. We argue that technology studies need theoretical approaches that enable joint understandings of the vocal specificities and infrastructural nature of DVA’s and propose vocal infrastructuring as a concept for tuning in on these dimensions of technology to understand the silent yet profound sonic-material, imaginary and ontological transformations that follow DVA implementation in homes and everyday domestic life.",

          "abstract": "The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs), allows ordinary users to turn themselves or their loved ones into AI chatbots. Based on the analysis of media reporting on users’ experiences, the study identifies three major features that frequently appear in users’ interactions with ghostbots simulating their deceased loved ones: (1) the interactions often elicit intense emotional responses from the users; (2) the purposes of using ghostbots can be practical, including mitigating grief, seeking advices, looking for emotional support, or say a final goodbye; and (3) the interactions may generate new knowledge, ideas, and memories about the dead. The study also introduces the concept of artificial continuing communication , recognizing the interpretative asymmetry inherent in interactions with AI interlocutors, while emphasizing the continuing bonds between the living and the dead. I argue that although ghosts are reduced versions of the dead, this emerging form of communication challenges the normative hydraulic model of the psyche, which views grief as a negative emotion to be discharged and emphasizes emotional detachment from the deceased. I contend that a type of thin reciprocal love exists between the users and their ghostbots and suggest that the ghostbot use offers an alternative perspective on how we relate to love, loss, and emotional continuity, albeit its user base remains small.",

          "abstract": "This article conducts a bibliometric analysis of 816 Games and Culture publications (2006–2025) indexed in Scopus to explore how specialized journals shape the institutionalization of interdisciplinary fields. Through citation networks, keyword co-occurrence, authorship, and geographic analyses, it treats the journal as a model of scholarly infrastructure in game studies. Results reveal steady publication growth (from 20 to over 100 articles annually), increasing collaboration (2.39 authors per paper), substantial citation accumulation (2006–2008 works exceeding 3,000 citations), and diversification beyond anglophone regions. Temporal keyword trends trace thematic shifts from virtual worlds and MMOs to esports, ethics, gamification, and representation. These findings inform broader debates on how niche journals foster disciplinary legitimacy, showing that Games and Culture has been central to consolidating game studies and offers a transferable framework for examining institutionalization in other interdisciplinary domains.",

Design/methodology/approach By comparing salient explanations and norm-based explanations across different age groups, we analyzed how these explanatory strategies reduce learning costs and enhance cognitive trust in the algorithm. Findings The study finds that both salient and norm-based explanations can reduce learning costs and enhance users’ cognitive trust in algorithms; however, norm-based explanations are particularly effective for younger users. Additionally, the study finds no significant interaction between the two types of explanations. Importantly, effective explanations can enhance both cognitive trust in the algorithm and affective trust in the government. Originality/value This research suggests that “nudges” in explanations can enhance citizens’ trust in algorithmic public services, which is significant for increasing acceptance of these algorithms.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is increasingly embedded in service operations, particularly in crafting managerial responses (MRs) to online negative and positive reviews. Yet, little is known about how firms should optimally allocate responsibilities between human staff and GAI across distinct response tasks, nor how such allocations shape consumer perceptions and downstream behavioral intentions. This study investigates how customers evaluate MRs produced by different agents including humans, GAI and multiple forms of human and GAI collaboration across specific response tasks. Design/methodology/approach We conducted a randomized online experiment. Main effects were examined using ANOVA with data from 879 participants, and the underlying mechanisms were further analyzed using the PROCESS macro with a parallel mediation model. Findings Our findings show that to improve customer satisfaction and increase booking intentions, negative reviews are most effectively addressed through an augmented human approach in which GAI creates an initial draft and experienced professional staff refine it. In contrast, positive reviews are best handled solely by experienced professional staff. Originality/value This study advances knowledge on how to combine GAI with human efforts in service operations, identifies key psychological mechanisms that mediate the effects of different collaboration modes on consumer perceptions and behavioral intentions and offers actionable guidance for service operations managers. The results suggest that GAI should be deployed strategically to augment, rather than replace, human intelligence.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Cognitive absorption is critical for hedonic technology addiction, yet the mediating mechanisms by which cognitive absorption affects hedonic technology addiction remain unclear. Drawing on dual-system theory, which posits that reflexive and reflective systems are pivotal in shaping user decisions and behaviors, this study seeks to deepen our understanding of the drivers of hedonic technology addiction. We conceptualize impulsive urge as the reflexive system and self-regulation as the reflective system, aiming to uncover the mediating roles of these two distinct systems in linking cognitive absorption to hedonic technology addiction. Design/methodology/approach A longitudinal survey involving 410 online gamers was conducted, with data collected at two time points separated by a 6-week interval. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was employed to validate the proposed research model. Findings The results indicate that cognitive absorption elicits responses from both reflexive and reflective systems. Specifically, cognitive absorption enhances the reflexive system via impulsive urge, while inhibiting the reflective system through impaired self-regulation. The joint full mediation of impulsive urge and self-regulation in the relationship between cognitive absorption and hedonic technology addiction has been proved. Our results shed lights on the underlying reflexive and reflective systems by which cognitive absorption affects hedonic technology addiction. Originality/value This study leverages dual-system theory to elucidate the mediating mechanisms through which cognitive absorption influences hedonic technology addiction. By demonstrating how cognitive absorption triggers addictive behaviors through heightened impulsive urges and impaired self-regulation, this study advances the literature on hedonic technology addiction and offers actionable strategies for intervention.

          "abstract": "Purpose Live streaming has transformed audience–performer relations by integrating real-time mass broadcasting with varying levels of interactivity. Due to this shift, concepts regarding parasocial and trans-parasocial phenomena have gained prominence in live streaming research, particularly in the information systems (IS) literature. However, existing knowledge in this field remains fragmented, and theoretical debates regarding the applicability of parasocial concepts remain unresolved. Therefore, a systematic literature review is conducted to synthesize existing research, identify key gaps, and suggest future avenues of inquiry. Design/methodology/approach A two-stage literature search is carried out to systematically identify relevant studies for review. The authors analyze and synthesize the identified studies using the established theories, contexts, characteristics, and methodologies (TCCM) framework. The ongoing debate on the applicability of the concepts in question to live streaming is also discussed, and the existing perspectives on this issue are summarized into four key themes. Findings This systematic literature review consolidates the relevant knowledge and identifies gaps. Future research directions are also outlined, emphasizing the need for clearer conceptual boundaries, broader research contexts, explorations of potential variables, and methodological advancements to strengthen the theoretical and empirical foundations of the topic. Originality/value This study synthesizes existing research through a systematic literature review. This allows the clarification of theoretical debates, the identification of key knowledge gaps, and the outlining of a research agenda on parasocial and trans-parasocial phenomena in live streaming. By consolidating fragmented discussions into themes, it addresses theoretical ambiguities regarding the application of parasocial and trans-parasocial phenomena in live streaming.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Virtual influencers (VIs) are increasingly used for brand endorsements. While consumer interaction with VIs is growing, little is known about the motivations behind these interactions and how they influence consumer behavior. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through an online survey of 298 users who interact with VIs. The model was tested using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings Consumers interact with VIs to satisfy their intellectual, novelty, entertainment and social needs. These needs positively influence self-expansion, which in turn enhances brand identification and purchase intention. Research limitations/implications This study is limited by its cross-sectional design, reliance on self-reported data, and focus on predominantly individualistic respondents in the UK. Future studies should examine cross-cultural samples, employ longitudinal or experimental designs to establish causality, and explore additional psychological mechanisms that might shape consumer-VI interactions. Practical implications The findings of this study can help marketers and VI developers understand how to use VIs to enhance consumer interaction and stimulate purchase intention.

          "abstract": "Purpose Understanding the causes and the consequences of online romance scam victimization fear, a psychological stress, is crucial for online daters to achieve a positive experience and for online dating platforms to provide that experience. This research contextualized and tested a theory concerning the negative psychological factors of online romance scams and their consequences on online dating positive psychology. Design/methodology/approach This study employed a developmental mixed-method design. The first phase was a qualitative study following a positivist paradigm. The second phase was a survey-based quantitative study. After the quantitative results, this research combined the understanding from both phases to develop the meta-inferences and finalized the antecedents and consequences of online romance scam victimization fear in online dating. Findings An increase in online romance scam-related anxiety and social vulnerability is positively associated with cognitive vulnerability. An increase in online romance scam-related anxiety, cognitive vulnerability and social vulnerability is positively associated with online romance scam victimization fear. An increase in online romance scam-related anxiety, cognitive vulnerability, social vulnerability and victimization fear is negatively associated with online dating psychological capital. Practical implications Utilizing this study’s findings, dating platforms can develop strategies to reduce users’ fear of online romance scam victimization and provide them with higher psychological capital to continue online dating. Originality/value The study contributes to cybercrime and online dating literature by capturing the psychological antecedents of scam victimization fear and showing how fear stimuli can lead to responses, which in turn cause a detrimental effect on online dating psychological capital.",

          "authors": "Inchan Kim, Sun-young Whang",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to advance organizing vision (OV) theory – a much-overlooked native IS theory – by extending it to the digital age. Specifically, despite the empowerment of everyday actors in the digital age, the theory offers limited insights into how everyday actors help shape community cognition around a technology (i.e. OV). We aim to address this critical lag in OV theory in the new era. Design/methodology/approach This study is an inductive, theory-building case study of the organizing vision for fitness trackers. We performed a constant comparison analysis between the data and our emergent understandings. Findings We discover that everyday actors broadly perform four OV-constituting acts. They include composing, amplifying, muffling and contextualizing. Each act is rooted in more concrete, discursive technology framings. Everyday actors' constituting acts also evolve over time, generating more nuanced OV trajectories than previously documented in the literature. Practical implications Everyday people are now central to shaping the meaning, legitimacy and adoption of digital technologies. Firms, marketers, policymakers and educators who ignore their discourse risk missing critical drivers of diffusion in the digital era. Originality/value Theorizing everyday actors is novel to OV theory. Specifically, our study challenges an assumption rooted in the 1990s information age, captures unique ways in which everyday actors discursively frame technology, and produces a concrete conceptual tool – a typology of OV-constituting acts – that is conducive to aptly theorizing OVs in the digital era. Our longitudinal findings also recast a widely held view that an OV evolves as an integrated whole in a unified manner.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Existing research has provided limited insights into the dynamic mechanisms through which multiple signals are interpreted within online health communities (OHCs). This study attempts to initiate a more integrative understanding of the dynamic interaction effects between patient-generated signals (i.e. herding and word-of-mouth signals) and physician-generated signals (i.e. central effort and peripheral effort signals) on online physician consultations. Design/methodology/approach This study adopts a dynamic panel modelling approach, applying longitudinal data collected from 844 physicians from June to December 2020. Specifically, the two-step system, generalised method of moments (GMM) with instrumental variables and propensity score matching (PSM) were employed to estimate the proposed research model. Findings This research provides empirical evidence that the herding signal and the word-of-mouth (WOM) signal have a positive effect on physician consultations within OHCs. Our findings also demonstrate that the peripheral effort signal complements the effect of the WOM signal on physician consultations, whereas it substitutes for the influence of the herding signal on physician consultations. In addition, this study finds that the central effort signal substitutes the effect of the WOM signal on physician consultation as it intensifies. Originality/value This study contextualises and frames a multidimensional signal framework of the herding signal, the WOM signal, the central effort signal and the peripheral effort signal in OHCs, which augments the predominant applications of signalling theory in e-commerce contexts. Furthermore, this research broadens the theoretical comprehension of signalling theory by revealing the substitutive and complementary effects among these signals, particularly in a mixed signalling environment.",

          "authors": "Yuqi Zheng, Yuhao Li",
          "abstract": "Purpose Social media platforms leverage user data to precisely deliver persuasive in-feed advertising aimed at promoting products. However, this approach may provoke heightened adverse reactions among users with elevated privacy sensitivity. This study examines the mechanisms by which privacy-sensitive users avoid persuasive narratives embedded in in-feed native advertising, with a particular focus on the processes of psychological reactance and visual avoidance. Design/methodology/approach This study employed two laboratory experiments and an eye-tracking experiment to examine how privacy-sensitive users process persuasive in-feed native advertising. The eye-tracking component was used to observe users’ visual attention biases, and gaze data were analyzed using a binning approach to segment early- and later-stage attentional processing. Findings Findings indicated that privacy-sensitive users exhibited avoidance toward persuasive advertising, mediated by psychological reactance. Users demonstrated a simultaneous presence of attentional avoidance and whole-period attention toward persuasive narratives. Specifically, results showed that privacy-sensitive users exhibited early-stage visual avoidance toward persuasive ads, while late-stage attention proved difficult to disengage, providing evidence for attentional biases and impacting ad avoidance attitudes. Originality/value This study advances advertising research by integrating psychological reactance theory and attentional bias into the context of in-feed native advertising. Using lab experiments and eye-tracking, it reveals how privacy-sensitive users engage in cognitive and visual advertising avoidance. A key contribution lies in applying time-course analysis to uncover dynamic gaze patterns, bridging attention and avoidance. Findings offer novel theoretical insights and practical strategies for advertisers, platforms and designers.",

          "authors": "Yingyu Luo, Di Peng, Guowei Zhu, Jing Huang",
          "abstract": "Purpose In social media, there is a growing trend of individuals increasingly opting to conceal personal information that they once openly shared. Previous research has examined factors influencing self-disclosure but has not addressed how the duration of disclosed information (DDI) influences continuous disclosure behavior. Design/methodology/approach We test our proposed hypotheses through six experiments. Descriptive statistics, mediation and moderation analyses were conducted on the data collected from the online platform to test the hypotheses of this research. Findings The results of this study demonstrate a “time sensitivity” effect in self-disclosure, indicating that as DDI increases, individuals perceive the information to be more sensitive, leading to a decreased intention to continue disclosure. This effect is driven by psychological responses in which longer DDI increases perceived cognitive conflict, and it is moderated by tie strength, being amplified under weaker ties and attenuated under stronger ties. Research limitations/implications The current study suggests that future research should be conducted in non-social and anonymous contexts, in unfamiliar social environments and on the bidirectional link between disclosure duration and perceived sensitivity. Originality/value First, this study advances the literature on information sensitivity by introducing a dynamic temporal perspective. Second, we identify cognitive conflict as a key mechanism underlying this effect, explaining how shifts in self-perception influence perceived sensitivity. Third, we establish tie strength as a boundary condition for the “time sensitivity” effect. Finally, we extend the self-disclosure literature by shifting the focus from momentary disclosures to continuous self-disclosure behaviors, highlighting how disclosure timing shapes ongoing information-sharing decisions.",

          "abstract": "This contribution examines the role of linguistic abstraction and valence of terms in the portrayal of immigrants and Italians in national and local newspapers with different political leanings. Specifically, it investigates how linguistic abstraction and valence of terms vary between the two most popular Italian national outlets and between these and a highly read local newspaper. The sample consisted of 218 newspaper articles on immigration. Results showed that across newspapers, immigrants are generally described using negative terms at a higher level of abstraction than Italians, as well as with negative terms at a higher level of abstraction than positive terms. Furthermore, national newspaper articles used terms at a higher level of abstraction than those in the local newspaper when describing immigrants and Italians. This contribution offers novel insights into how linguistic intergroup discrimination is conveyed in newspapers of a country where immigration is increasingly becoming a debated topic.",

          "authors": "Yael Ecker, Jens Lange, Corey L. Cook",
          "abstract": "We investigated the reciprocal relationships between jealousy and maintenance versus protection goal striving in romantic relationships. While existing research has examined various ways romantic partners respond to jealousy and invest in their relationships, it lacks a distinction between routine acts of regular care for the current state of the relationship (maintenance goal striving) and acts that protect against anticipated negative outcomes (protection goal striving). Drawing from the ternary goal framework—which delineates maintenance, protection, and progress as three inherently distinct goal types—we hypothesized that jealousy leads individuals to favor protection over maintenance goal striving, and that this shift creates a self-reinforcing cycle with jealousy. Across three studies ( N = 842), including experimental (Study 1) and longitudinal approaches with individual (Study 2) and dyadic data (Study 3), we found support for jealousy’s influence on goal priorities. Study 1’s experimental manipulation showed jealousy decreased maintenance motivation while leaving protection unchanged. In the longitudinal studies, jealousy predicted increased protection striving at both within-person (Study 2) and between-person levels (Studies 2 and 3), while effects on maintenance were either negative (Study 2) or absent (Study 3). Examining the reverse direction, individuals who chronically engaged in more protection striving showed increases in jealousy over time in both longitudinal studies. This research provides initial evidence that protection and maintenance goals play distinct roles in romantic relationships. The reinforcing cycle of jealousy and protection may have important implications for relationship functioning, as protection efforts may come at the cost of regular maintenance efforts that typically sustain relationship stability and satisfaction.",

This study analyzed varying configurations of parent-child political discordance—including partisan-partisan and partisan-neutral dyads—in Hong Kong ( N = 586) following the 2019 social unrest and examined its familial and psychological consequences over two weeks ( n = 200). Findings indicate that neutral-partisan dyads, similar to their partisan-counterparts, exhibited significantly larger differences in support for government, police, and anti-government protestors compared to politically concordant dyads. Dyads in which one member supported the anti-government (“ yellow ”) camp and the other supported the pro-government (“ blue ”) camp or identified as neutral reported lower levels of positive communication and poorer family functioning than dyads sharing the same stance. Mediation analyses revealed that reduced positive communication explained the impact of political discordance on increased psychological distress across discordant dyads. However, this mediation effect on family functioning was observed only in yellow - neutral and yellow - blue dyads. By incorporating partisan-neutral disagreements into the analysis, this study offers an ecologically valid account of parent-child political discordance among partisan and neutral family members, highlighting the potential threat to both personal and family well-being when intrafamilial communication is compromised.",

          "authors": "Jinman Zhang, Anabel Quan-Haase",
          "abstract": "Past studies have shown the value of social media for feminist activism in China. Yet, activists encounter strict censorship, negatively impacting their mobilization efforts. Existing studies have documented the strategies activists use to circumvent censorship by analyzing digital trace data but have not yet examined their censorship experiences. To fill this gap, the present study draws on reactance theory to investigate the experiences of social media feminist activists in China through 19 in-depth interviews. Following calls to examine digital resilience in the era of polycrisis, this study also contributes to rethinking digital resilience as not only resistance to censorship, but as an adaptive capacity to maintain agency and continuity in activism. We conducted a cross-platform comparison contrasting activists’ censorship experiences across Weibo and Zhihu. We found a hierarchy of concerns underlying censorship mechanisms. We identified five types of cognitive reactance: ambiguity, disagreement, unfairness, believing in a lack of control, and critical questioning of the positive energy motto. Affective reactance manifested through feelings of anger and irritation toward haphazard censorship enforcement. Digital resilience was visible in both cognitive and affective reactance, which motivated participants to restore their freedom. Participants used two types of direct means to regain their lost freedom: seeking and disseminating censored information. A few participants engaged in indirect restoration by reinterpreting the state’s motto of positive energy. The findings suggest activists developed different forms of digital resilience on Zhihu and Weibo that reflect unique platform affordances and regulations. We outline implications for reactance theory and future research.",

          "authors": "Ben Egliston",
          "abstract": "This article examines the role of venture capital (VC) in the financialisation of the videogame industry. It analyses investment data to map the political economy of VC in the videogame industry and public-facing industry discourse to explore how VCs frame their investments. Findings show that VC investment is concentrated in scalable, high-growth areas such as mobile gaming, production and distribution infrastructure and emerging technologies like blockchain and AI. Investment is largely early-stage and geographically skewed towards established technology and production hubs. Discursively, VCs position themselves as driving technological innovation and cultural growth, and as playing a key role in shaping the industry’s future. The article contributes to debates on financialisation in the media industries by situating VC as a key (yet underexamined) institutional actor in contemporary game production.",

          "abstract": "The recent global rise of far-right ideologies has been accompanied by the normalization of these ideas in online communication. However, little is known about the strategies employed by the far right to drive this trend, particularly outside Western countries and major platforms. This study addresses these gaps by conducting a systematic content analysis of far-right content on VK (VKontakte), the most widely used Russian social network, to examine the content’s characteristics that facilitate the mainstreaming of the far right. Findings indicate that far-right actors leverage agenda-setting mechanisms and adopt news-like formats to embed xenophobic and exclusionary narratives within the broader mainstream Russian discourse. This study contributes to research on far-right content-related strategies and the interplay between non-Western contexts, digital affordances, and far-right communication in less regulated online spaces.",

          "abstract": "We examine how people collectively and creatively appropriate information communication technology (ICT) in Havana, Cuba, to navigate persistent scarcity and pursue a more stable life. Drawing on interviews and ethnographic data, we center resolver —an emic term for both an informal acquisition process and a problem-solving mindset—as a dynamic, collective strategy. This practice underpins aspirations for a “decent” life, locally understood as adequacy, stability, and solidarity. Our findings show ICT appropriation is deeply intertwined with evolving moral judgments and solidarity, requiring continual negotiation of legality, necessity, and communal values. Rather than uniformly empowering, ICT use mediates inclusion and exclusion, highlighting new forms of inequality. By theorizing resolver as a recursive and context-dependent process, we provide an analytical lens for examining how digital technologies shape aspirations, collective life, and the boundaries of decency in resource-constrained environments.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive jealousy, which involves thoughts and suspicions of a partner's infidelity, is linked to various negative outcomes. Yet, little is known about how it fluctuates over time or across different relationships. This longitudinal study examined 891 young, unmarried adults in romantic relationships over 5 years (11 assessment points), capturing 1507 total relationships. About 42% of participants reported being in more than one relationship during the study period. The study examined how cognitive jealousy varies within individuals, across different relationships, in relation to individual traits such as neuroticism, attachment anxiety, and gender, and in relation to experiences of extradyadic sexual involvement (either self‐ or partner‐reported). Results showed that while 28.2% of the variance in cognitive jealousy was due to differences between individuals, the largest proportion (39.8%) was due to differences between relationships. Within a particular relationship, initial levels of cognitive jealousy remained relatively stable over time. Higher levels of neuroticism, attachment anxiety, and experiences of extradyadic sexual involvement (both self‐ and partner‐reported) were associated with greater cognitive jealousy. Men reported higher initial levels of cognitive jealousy than women. These findings suggest that relationship‐specific dynamics as well as individual differences play a crucial role in the experience of cognitive jealousy.",

          "abstract": "This study explores makeup use as a form of code switching among women in science communication. Drawing on Goffman’s dramaturgical theory and Butler’s concept of performativity, it examines how appearance is strategically adapted to navigate expectations of credibility, authority, and professionalism. Semistructured interviews ( n = 29) with participants across disciplines and career stages revealed two central themes: identity shaping and appearance adaptation. Findings suggest that while makeup can enhance confidence and support professional self-presentation, it simultaneously reinforces gendered norms linking competence to appearance. These insights contribute to broader understandings of gender performance within science communication environments and public-facing academic work.",

          "authors": "Rongxin Ouyang, Subhayan Mukerjee, Tian Yang",
          "abstract": "Audience engagement signals on social media platforms have shaped how media outlets produce news. Mukerjee et al. examined this phenomenon empirically by estimating the extent to which media outlets respond to audience engagement signals on Facebook in deciding what news to publish on the platform. However, the extent to which their findings can be generalized to other social media platforms remains unknown. We replicate their study on Twitter using the same methodological pipeline ( N ≈ 4 . 55 million posts, twenty-eight media outlets, between 2015 and 2019). Our results indicate that media responsiveness to audience engagement on Twitter aligns with the core patterns identified in the Facebook study. Specifically, topics receiving higher audience engagement generally experience significantly increased coverage shortly thereafter, and the responsiveness is not conditioned on the nature of topics. However, we observe three differences in dynamics on Twitter compared to Facebook: first, the maximum response window on Twitter is shorter; second, conservative outlets on Twitter are not more likely to respond to engagement signals; third, platform-specific metrics (e.g., retweets) show different patterns of responsiveness. Our replication thus highlights the generalizability of the original study while underscoring the importance of platform-specific characteristics in shaping media production on social media.",
