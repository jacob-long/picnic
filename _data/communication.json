          "authors": "William Roth Smith",
          "abstract": "Communication constitutes organizing (CCO) theorizing offers compelling explanations of how organizations are constituted through communication, yet CCO is often criticized for paying scant attention to issues of power. This article draws upon communicative relationality and the recent Deleuzian inspired techniques and forces (T&amp;F) framework to investigate how power materializes in the relations/links/connections communicatively constituting a fluid social movement aimed at stopping construction of a police training facility. Through interviews, observation, and social media analysis, I theorize how diverse multimodal communication by activists and the state materialize links constituting the movement. This article contributes to T&amp;F by empirically specifying a boundary condition of techniques, adding the concept of substantiating to describe fleeting materializations, and revealing how relations constituting fluid organizing coalesce around identity, geography, temporality, and civic issues. Ultimately, the article deepens CCO theorizing of power and shows how T&amp;F and relationality offer broader theorizing of communicative constitution of organizing.",

          "abstract": "This research explores and analyses the relationship between AI and the concept of creative expression within the realm of games art, as well as whether AI can potentially benefit or harm this form of expression in the industry. To do so, this dissertation investigates existing research relevant to this topic, as well as various case studies of digital media products that have already been impacted using AI-generated art. These findings will then be applied to a comprehensive comparison process, in which AI-generated artistic components will be viewed alongside assets made without the use of artificial intelligence by research participants so that various factors can be analyzed. Through this empirical research, factors such as production time, ethical considerations, accuracy and aesthetic appeal are discussed to shed light on the broader implications and benefits of AI-generated art on the creative landscape.",

          "authors": "Christopher Ball, Kuo-Ting Huang, Xuan Nie, Elaine Kong, JM Shalani Dilinika",
          "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), a branch of AI capable of producing novel content from human input, is poised to transform various aspects of society. However, the benefits and challenges of GenAI adoption are not equally distributed, contributing to a new layer of digital inequality, the GenAI divide. This study examines the individual factors associated with psychological barriers, GenAI competency, and adoption readiness. Using data from a stratified online survey of 305 participants, the study explores sociodemographic variables (e.g., sex, age, race, education, and income), as well as competency factors (e.g., operational and creative skills) and psychological factors (e.g., attitudes toward AI, GenAI decision reliance, and self-efficacy). Findings reveal that operational skills and comfort with AI were significantly associated with lower anxiety and higher adoption readiness, whereas negative technology attitudes were associated with increased barriers. Furthermore, greater reliance on GenAI for decision-making was associated with lower self-assessed competency, suggesting a compensatory mechanism in which less confident users may increasingly depend on automated recommendations. These results highlight the multi-dimensional nature of the GenAI divide, emphasizing the interplay between individual-level factors and inequality-related outcomes. The study underscores the need for targeted interventions, such as AI literacy programs and supportive digital communities, to address these disparities and promote equitable access to the benefits of GenAI. By identifying key factors associated with GenAI adoption, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of digital inequality in the age of generative AI technologies.",

          "abstract": "This article analyses how Estonian journalists negotiated professional boundaries over a decade of technological and organisational change. Based on five interview waves (2012–2023) in national and local newsrooms, it traces shifts in symbolic, epistemic, organisational and temporal boundaries. Results show migration rather than erosion: from the marginalisation of online journalism in 2012, through debates about originality and quality, to institutionalised convergence and questions surrounding metrics in 2022/2023. Journalists accepted digital integration as routine but defended verification and public value. The study provides a diachronic account of identity formation in a small Central and Eastern European market, extending boundary work research by highlighting shifting lines of legitimacy and demonstrating how commercial and organisational pressures, rather than political capture, dominate struggles over identity.",

          "authors": "Johan Farkas, Mette Bengtsson",
          "abstract": "This article investigates how professional fact-checkers defend collaborations with major platform companies such as Meta, Alphabet, and ByteDance. Drawing on 12 qualitative interviews with European fact-checkers, the study applies rhetorical apologia theory to analyse recurring justificatory arguments. We identify four modes of differentiation and three modes of transcendence employed by fact-checkers. Arguments of differentiation involve distancing fact-checking from platform company partners to emphasise editorial independence; distinguishing between different platform companies to legitimise partnerships with certain actors while rejecting others (notably TikTok owned by ByteDance); separating platform companies as a whole and specific employees within them; and contrasting platform funding with state funding to defend the former as less compromising for editorial autonomy. Arguments of transcendence invoke counter-factual scenarios of unmitigated misinformation; appealing to broader alliances against disinformation; and highlighting the potential for improving platform companies from within. These findings contribute to existing scholarship by unpacking how fact-checkers negotiate the complex institutional dependencies of platform company partnerships by simultaneously acknowledging risks and asserting pragmatic necessity. As such, the study provides a deeper understanding of the challenges facing fact-checking organisations and their efforts to establish legitimacy as epistemic authorities in the boundary terrain shared with other key actors in today's media landscape.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the role of social media and influencers in promoting harmful physical stereotypes that increase adolescents’ vulnerability to eating disorders (EDs). Using a mixed-method approach, we analyse national and international news on EDs published by El País and El Mundo in 2024 ( N = 24), along with a content analysis of 10 Instagram profiles of celebrities who have publicly acknowledged suffering from EDs. Although information about these disorders is abundant, adolescents do not always interpret it critically. Social media has become a space where unhealthy aesthetic ideals and unverified health content circulate widely. Influencers often reinforce extreme thinness and perfection, while messages on mental health or body diversity remain scarce. We also identify digital subcultures that normalise risky practices, including viral challenges and pro-anorexia communities. The study highlights the importance of enhancing media literacy, promoting positive role models and demanding greater accountability in content targeted at minors.",

          "authors": "Tamas Tofalvy",
          "abstract": "In recent years, the field of digital journalism in Hungary has undergone a profound transformation. One of the driving forces behind this change is the global platformisation of journalism, which has had far-reaching effects on journalism's business and practices. Another, local factor is the government's increasing intervention in the media industry and journalism. Using Telex.hu, one of Hungary's most read independent online news sites as a case study, this paper maps the socio-technical web of affordances and dependencies that digital journalistic content production and distribution must navigate under these circumstances. The paper concludes that the government's economic interventions weaken the financial relationship between journalism and advertisers, while platforms’ dominance over distribution channels weakens the direct relationship between journalism and audiences. The interplay of media and platform captures form a hybrid ecosystem of control in which content functions as the operational intersection point of political-economic and technological power.",

          "abstract": "Understanding covert discrimination is as critical as overt discrimination in combating injustices. This study examines how news media consumption and trust shape covert discriminatory preferences. By analyzing various news media sources (television, newspapers, and social media) and various discrimination grounds, we highlight the complex relationship between factors driving covert discrimination. We use data from an online survey among 3000 Belgian adults, employing a conjoint experimental design to capture implicit bias in the seating preferences on public transport. Results show that media consumption and trust significantly moderate discriminatory preferences. Light consumers of public television news and heavy consumers of commercial television news display greater discriminatory preferences. Higher trust in public broadcasters and quality newspapers aligns with favoring individuals without visible minority traits, while lower trust correlates with preferences for overweight and transgender individuals. TikTok, X, and Instagram consumption also influences these patterns. Our findings have implications for media policy and diversity interventions.",

          "abstract": "This special issue examines contemporary challenges and transformations of journalistic practices and professional ideology in four Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary and Slovenia. Focusing on issues such as journalistic professionalism, platformisation, changing business models and content production under conditions of technological change, the contributions address developments that are embedded in broader global transformations of journalism. At the same time, the articles demonstrate that global trends intersect with distinct historical, political and market contexts in CEE, producing divergent outcomes across media systems. By situating national case studies within a comparative framework, the special issue highlights how political pressures, market constraints and technological dependencies reshape journalism in uneven ways, contributing to persistent diversity in journalistic cultures and professional practices across the region.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines how journalistic professionalism in Slovenia is continually renegotiated through the interplay of normative ideals, ideological imperatives and material constraints. By tracing how normative commitments rooted in the principle of publicity interact with ideological imperatives and material constraints, professionalism in Slovenian news journalism is shown to be relational and constantly reconfigured. These forces converge uniquely, revealing tensions and compromises inherent in maintaining journalistic professionalism amid the reconfiguration of autonomy, the pauperisation of journalistic work, the proletarisation of the journalism community and the growing digitalisation and platformisation of news production. Introducing the concept of hollow professionalism, the paper argues that notwithstanding the symbolic architecture of professionalism in place, its normative core is ever more constrained by ideological influences and material pressures, leaving professionalism more performative and a matter of instrumental rationality.",

          "authors": "Lenka Waschková Císařová",
          "abstract": "Editors are in an ambivalent position: on the one hand, their contribution to the production of journalistic content is often invisible to the outside world; on the other, their practices, responsibilities and the teamwork in which they hold decisive positions are considered key components of professional journalism. As their role is generally understudied or treated as part of the wider field of journalism, they find themselves on the periphery of journalism studies. Information about editors’ professional practices and how they change is particularly scarce in the context of Central and Eastern European post-transformation media systems. This paper addresses this gap by examining how two generations of Czech editors perceive and assess their work. Drawing on in-depth interviews, the findings uncover differences and similarities between the downturn and the transformation generations of Czech editors, including the conflicts perceived and the mutual criticisms formulated by representatives of the two generations.",

          "abstract": "We report a systematic review of longitudinal studies published in SSCI-Communication journals over the 50 years, focusing on how time is conceived, measured, and analyzed as a scientific concept. To facilitate the review, we devised two novel classification schemes to distinguish between longitudinal and non-longitudinal studies and to measure how time is treated. We manually coded a random sample of 1,080 research articles, supplemented with computerized keyword scanning of the study population. The results show that longitudinal studies have steadily accounted for about 9% of the publications. Panel data studies outnumber time-series studies in a ratio of 3:2. Three-fourths of the longitudinal studies treat time as a timing index and aim to test causal effects, whereas a quarter treat time as a parameter to capture temporal dynamics. Longitudinal studies make more conceptual contributions and receive more citations than non-longitudinal studies. We offer practical recommendations for longitudinal communication research.",

          "abstract": "The “n-word” remains one of the most offensive racial slurs, yet it is used by both Black and non-Black individuals. Across three studies (total N = 1,063), we examined how Black people perceive its use based on the speaker's racial identity and racial self-identification, while also varying valence and context. In Study 1, we varied the target race who used the n-word (Black, Black–White biracial, White); in Study 2, we manipulated the valence in which the n-word was used (positive or negative); and in Study 3, we explored how a biracial person racially self-identified (Black-identified, biracial-identified, or Black-disidentified) shaped reactions. Black participants reported more negative perceptions and affective responses when a White (Studies 1 and 2) or Black-disidentified biracial (Study 3) target used the word, compared to Black, Black–White biracial (Studies 1 and 2), or Black-identified biracial (Study 3) targets, highlighting how racial identity shapes perceptions of those who use racial slurs.",

          "authors": "Jiaqi Zeng, Rain Wuyu Liu",
          "abstract": "Interpersonal conflict research has traditionally emphasized cultural determinants of conflict styles while overlooking their context-sensitive nature. Addressing this gap, our study examines how generational differences, cultural values, and socio-demographic factors relate to romantic conflict management among Chinese women. The evolving conflict styles reflect how macro-social changes influence interpersonal relationships, capturing the dynamic interplay between tradition and modernity. Drawing from Rahim and Ting-Toomey’s conflict frameworks, we examined seven conflict styles through a multi-generational online survey ( N = 469): dominating, avoiding, obliging, productive integrating, third-party help, emotional expression, and passive-aggressive. Results revealed distinct generational patterns, with Gen X (Chinese women born in 1960–1979) reporting higher use of power-oriented approaches (e.g., dominating and avoiding) compared to younger generations, who indicated greater inclinations toward problem-solving strategies (e.g., third-party help and obliging). Cultural values emerged as significant correlates, with individualism positively associated with both confrontational (dominating) and indirect strategies (passive-aggressive), whereas collectivism was positively related to cooperative approaches (productive integrating and obliging) but negatively related to avoidance. Socio-demographic characteristics, including argument frequency, education, and relationship status, were also significantly related to conflict styles, highlighting the influence of contextual variability in romantic conflict management. Our findings offer both theoretical insights and practical guidance for romantic relationship counseling and conflict resolution interventions.",

          "abstract": "Challenges faced by adult-child caregivers can intensify during calamitous events, potentially resulting in adjustment disorder symptoms. This study examined the contribution of demographic characteristics (age and gender), self-reported number of war-related stressful events, intolerance of uncertainty, and caregiver burden to explaining adjustment symptoms among adult-child caregivers who resided in Israel during the initial months of the Israel-Gaza war. A total of 402 Israeli adult-child caregivers participated in the study. We performed a three-step multiple hierarchical regression analysis. All independent variables included in the regression model had a significant contribution to explaining the variance in the dependent variable. Being female, younger, experiencing a higher number of war-related stressful events, higher reported intolerance of uncertainty, and greater reported caregiver burden were related to higher levels of adjustment disorder symptoms. The findings underscore the complex relationship between caregiving demands, wartime stressors, caregiver characteristics, and adjustment disorder symptoms among adult-child caregivers residing in Israel. Amidst 21st-century uncertainties, the challenges associated with caring for an older parent may intensify, along with their potential negative consequences. These findings lay the groundwork for developing policies and services tailored to provide adapted support to family caregivers during such challenging times.",

          "authors": "Olivia Crawford, Phoebe E. McKenna-Plumley, Rosalyn Millar, Tanja M. Gerlach",
          "abstract": "Across many regions of the world, more people are not having children. Non-parents are viewed more negatively than parents, particularly those who deliberately choose to forego parenthood. This systematic review synthesises existing literature on social networks and support among parents and non-parents, attempting to distinguish between different groups of non-parents, namely not-yet-parents, childless, and childfree individuals. Eighty studies were included, sourced from systematic searches of six scientific databases, supplemented by a systematic search of ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, hand searches of Google Scholar, websites of relevant organisations, reference lists from prior reviews and included studies, and contacting authors. Findings are presented using narrative synthesis, supplemented by average effect size estimates for group differences for selected aspects. Parents have larger, more stable, family-centred networks, reliant on children and relatives for support. In contrast, non-parents have smaller, more diverse networks, with closer relationships with friends and siblings, but often rely on formal (i.e. paid) sources of support. The available evidence on differences and distinctions between groups of non-parents is investigated, emphasising a need for appropriate operationalisation of reproductive status groups in future research. Implications of life course-related changes in social networks for those with and without children are discussed.",

We recruited 299 Chinese parent-child dyads, with adult children aged 18–29. Participants completed self-reported measures on (perceived) parenting styles, parent-child relationship quality. Adult children reported their mate preferences, while parents reported in-law preferences. We used latent profile analysis to classify profiles based on the combination of adult children’s mate preferences and parents’ in-law preferences, identifying five subgroups: Congruent-Low Standards, Incongruent-Parent Idealist, Congruent-Resource De-emphasis, Congruent-Resource Emphasis, and Incongruent-Child Gene Emphasis. The predictors of both parents’ and children’s (perceived) parenting styles, and parent-child relationship quality differed across the profiles. This study provided initial exploration of the profiles of parent-child congruence and incongruence in adult children’s mate preferences, shedding light on the associations between these profiles and parenting and parent-child relationship quality. We further discussed the practical implications of the findings.",

          "abstract": "Affective states and how people see their partner’s responsiveness are important for understanding relationship quality, but these processes are not well studied in non-Western settings. Drawing on the affect-as-information framework and theories of perceived partner responsiveness, this study tested whether responsiveness helps explain the link between daily affect and marital satisfaction. Data came from 203 heterosexual married couples in Sikkim, India. Using the Actor–Partner Interdependence Model with mediation, we examined positive and negative affect as simultaneous predictors of perceived partner responsiveness and marital satisfaction. Positive affect was linked to greater marital satisfaction through one’s own perception of partner responsiveness. Negative affect also showed an asymmetrical pattern, with only one partner’s negative affect predicting lower marital satisfaction for both spouses, partly through reduced responsiveness. Partner-mediated indirect effects were minimal. These findings highlight the role of everyday affect and perceived responsiveness in shaping marital satisfaction in cultural contexts that are less often studied.",

Significantly, news media emerged as a crucial factor in issue ownership, with the public displaying a greater reliance on liberal outlets.

It is noteworthy that the vast majority of such research has focused on hard news beats. In contrast, we know very little about the role that soft forms of news, such as lifestyle journalism, may play in reporting inclusion. To address this issue, this study draws on interviews with lifestyle journalists from Austria and the United States ( n = 74). We find that while this particular specialty offers potential for inclusion, lifestyle journalists broadly do not believe they are tapping that potential.",

          "authors": "Salvatore Romano, Miazia Schueler, Natalie Kerby, Davide Beraldo",
          "abstract": "Considering TikTok’s increasing geopolitical influence, this article presents the TikTok Global Observatory (TKGO) as a case of data-reappropriation and introduces the concept of platform-mediated proximity as a counter-data mapping framework for data activist research. While TikTok enables global connection beyond local and cultural boundaries, its content is sensitive to locally specific conditions to which the platform provides no public insight. To counter this lack of transparency, the TKGO makes data for global and cross-national analysis of TikTok feeds available and navigable to the research community. The TKGO is an archive, updated daily, that collects the metadata of videos scraped from the non-logged-in web version of TikTok’s for you page (FYP) across 197 countries and territories. The tool’s main feature is a geographic map that allows users to view, filter, sort, and extrapolate the FYP data as prioritized in different geographical locations. This offers a unique access point for researchers, journalists, and activists investigating cross-national trends, content moderation, and content promotion. In this article, we firstly present the TKGO and contextually position its development in the contentious politics of data access, archiving, and mapping practices. Secondly, we elaborate on the notion of platform-mediated proximities, a conceptual lens that highlights how TikTok remediates geographical proximities through algorithmic content recommendation. Lastly, we apply this framework to the mapping of a three-month sample of the TKGO data, showing how TikTok’s cross-national content prioritization patterns generate new geographical boundaries, observing regional and geopolitical clustering as well as notable exceptions.",

          "abstract": "This thematic issue shares research that critically analyzes counter-mapping undertaken by community groups who appropriate, collect, and utilize counter-datasets to unveil and reshape spatial realities. The articles consider a range of multidimensional sociotechnical cartographic practices, including the politics embedded in various uses of representation, visualization, interactivity, and cartographic imaginaries, framing counter data mapping as communicative practices of resistance. They deepen our understanding of how counter-mapping can be understood as a sociotechnical communicative practice through which communities inhabiting marginalized and vulnerable positions have collectively mobilized the affordances of mapping technologies to both visibilize and contest the root causes and consequences of marginalization. Scholars here consider how counter-mapping is embedded in notions of spatiality and relationality, probing dimensions of analysis that include data sourcing, objectives, capacities, processes, collaborations, ownership, strategic invisibility, and so on, providing evidence of the emerging importance of sociotechnical multidimensionality in the production and cartopolitics of community counter-maps.",

          "authors": "Carolina Monteiro de Carvalho",
          "abstract": "Participatory mapping’s main aim is to represent the community’s voice. It stimulates a powerful social mobilization that provides support for better and more efficient urban policies and social inclusion of marginalized populations, especially in Global South countries, such as Brazil. Our main urban challenges, such as poverty, inequality, and social injustice, are aggravated by climate change. The marginalized populations are often excluded from the decision-making process for planning our cities, which creates a mismatch between urban planning and the real demands of citizens. This article assesses how participatory mapping in informal settlements in Brazil can help to collect data from citizens that can make a difference in better local urban planning through prioritizing their demands and bringing to light their real concerns. Also, this article seeks to show how participatory mapping can provide products that improve communication between stakeholders and society reinforcing the need for urban planning improvements. Three case studies are presented, developed in São Paulo and Guarulhos informal settlements, with citizens’ perceptions about their urban life conditions, highlighting inequalities such as environmental racism, gendered perspectives, and social injustice, as well as potential solutions and specific areas for interventions. The three study cases provided citizens a space to speak and to be heard, to identify problems and concerns in a deprived environment through community mapping and look for solutions and alternatives for better urban scenarios together. Also, this article highlights the importance of the development of an urban agenda, putting the periphery in the center of the decision-making process through participatory mapping and communication products development.",

          "authors": "Haiwei Valerie Huang, Lijun Luo",
          "abstract": "During the 2025 Los Angeles wildfires and amid uncertainty over a TikTok ban, Xiaohongshu (RedNote) unexpectedly emerged as a site of transnational environmental discussion. This study examines how transnational conversations unfolded and their implications for community empowerment and environmental justice during a crisis. Drawing on qualitative content analysis and social network analysis of 505 wildfire-related posts, we find that user engagement centered on participatory practices (44.45%), including reporting and the circulation of practical information. Another substantial share of posts focused on building social ties through emotional support (16.33%), while critically questioning the causes of the fires (11.02%). Social network analysis further shows that grassroots users occupied central positions in the discourse. Together, these findings suggest that Xiaohongshu enabled communicative agency and empathetic transfer across borders, facilitating emergent forms of collective resilience. However, such potentials remain contingent, as algorithmic visibility and geopolitical conditions unevenly shape participation and recognition in digital spaces.",

My specific focus is on the LunaNet’s interoperability discourse which situates it within the technical, historical, and political trajectories of the Internet and within socio‑technical structures that shape power here on Earth. By analyzing this discourse, I argue that, when applied to outer space, the visions of interoperability are limited, overlooking what makes LunaNet distinctive—its ability to function without continuous connectivity. To foreground this point, I introduce the concept of extraoperability, a speculative framework that challenges Earth‑bound assumptions about Internet connectivity and proposes that alternative modes of relation may emerge when we network beyond our Blue Planet.",

          "abstract": "Large social media platforms are criticized for commodifying user data, corporate surveillance, and perceived censorship of political speech. As a result, some users flock to alternative platforms, like Telegram, Signal, VK, Parler, or Gettr. This study examines the roles of political ideology, anti-establishment views, and privacy concerns in the use of these five platforms. Based on survey data gathered in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany ( n = 1500 each), we find that alternative platform use is highest in the United States and in Germany. Digitally skilled, young, male, educated, and right-wing individuals are drawn to alternative social media. Across all five platforms, right-wing ideology is a stronger predictor of usage than anti-establishment views. In the pooled sample, privacy concerns do not correlate with usage. However, given inconsistencies in the roles of privacy concerns and anti-establishment views, we highlight the importance of specific platform affordances and national context.",

          "abstract": "Digital platforms have become central infrastructures of contemporary populism, shaping how actors communicate, mobilise supporters and contest democratic norms. This article offers a systematic, cross-disciplinary review of empirical research on digital populism published between 2015 and early 2025. Analysing 188 studies from political communication, media studies and political science, we map how platform affordances structure populist communication, how digital populism is conceptualised and how it is studied. The literature portrays digital populism as the communicative enactment of populist ideology in environments that privilege personalisation, affective intensity and direct leader–follower engagement. Methods span qualitative, computational and experimental designs, with research concentrated on Twitter/X and Facebook. Most studies examine exclusionary, right-wing cases in European and Western contexts and associate them with polarisation, misinformation and declining institutional trust. Evidence remains largely correlational, and inclusionary or participatory variants are underexplored. We identify key gaps and call for greater analytical precision in assessing democratic consequences.",

          "abstract": "Drawing on the complementarity perspective of romantic attraction, we examined dyadic initial attraction in a speed‐dating context among individuals characterized by light and dark personality traits. As hypothesized, analyses of dating success, involving over 1.400 heterosexual dates with 128 participants, showed that Machiavellianism was negatively related to dating success, and this relationship significantly interacted with the light triad personality traits exhibited by their dating partners. Although individuals with light personalities were not especially attracted to partners scoring high on Machiavellianism, they did not dislike them as strongly as others did. The same data pattern was found for sadism. In contrast, narcissism and psychopathy were not related to dating success, and light triad personality traits did not moderate these relationships. This pattern suggests that individuals with light personalities are less likely to reject those who are generally rejected by others. These results illuminate the dynamics of the early stages of dating, raising the question of whether individuals with light personalities deliberately give partners who are generally rejected a chance, or whether they simply fail to recognize their partners' Machiavellian and sadistic traits.",

We measured fulfillment of seven psychological needs and used latent profile analysis to identify potential heterogeneity in need fulfillment (NF) across two convenience samples: a sample of dating college students (Study 1: N = 688) and a sample of cohabiting participants recruited from Prolific (Study 2: N = 294). Five profiles consistently emerged: low fulfillment of all needs except independence (independence NF driven); greater fulfillment of personal needs than relational needs (personal NF driven); greater fulfillment of relational needs than personal needs (relational NF driven); moderate fulfillment of all needs (moderate NF); and high fulfillment of all needs (high NF). All these profiles differed from one another in relationship commitment and satisfaction, except that the personal NF driven profile was not significantly different from the relational NF profile in commitment in both studies and in relationship satisfaction in Study 2. The current research introduces a novel use of a person‐centered approach to advance understanding of individual differences in need fulfillment in romantic relationships.",

          "abstract": "Although romantic relationships are often idealized, many individuals find satisfaction in being single. Evidence shows social networks influence commitment within romantic relationships—with network approval being a boon, and disapproval a detractor—but whether this social network effect extends to commitment to being single remains unclear. This study examined whether perceived approval from parents and friends predicts commitment to singlehood and fear of being single, and if associations differ according to one's sexual orientation. Single US adults ( N = 501, 47% women, 50% White) identifying as heterosexual ( n = 256) and sexually diverse (e.g., gay, pansexual; n = 245) completed an online survey assessing aspects of singlehood. Network approval—especially from friends—is related to higher commitment and lower fear. After including covariates, approval was no longer associated with commitment or fear in either group. Combining heterosexual and sexually diverse participants, parent and friend approval remained significant predictors of lower fear, even after covariates were included. Subjective norms, calculated as opinions weighted by motivation to comply, showed little consistency in their associations. Approval from friends appears especially important for sexually diverse singles, who may rely more on their chosen family for social support. Findings extend understanding of the nuanced nature of the social network effect when applied to singlehood.",

I make this point by building on my experiences of studying science communication projects and by reflecting on their internal heterogeneity in terms of what they were ‘about’ for those organising them. By showing this diversity in the meanings of science communication to those carrying it out, and in particular how this is exacerbated by the conditions of precarity and scarcity that frequently frame science communication activities, I argue for the importance of understanding science communication practice as not only being ‘about’ the communication or negotiation of scientific knowledge, but myriad other aspects, from personal prestige to the need for a job.",

          "authors": "Christopher Calabrese, Haoning Xue, Xinyu Zhang, Yoo Jung Oh",
          "abstract": "We examined whether bypassing and combined (correction with bypassing) strategies delivered through artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots can address contraceptive misinformation. In Study 1, we found through observational reddit data that bypassing, correction, and combined strategies were present in online discussions and were more engaging than other responses. In Study 2, an experiment employing AI chatbots found that the combined strategy improved recommendation intentions compared with the control conditions, while also reducing beliefs in misinformation. The combined strategy AI chatbot was viewed as warmer and more competent than the correction, invoking less reactance and increasing recommendation intentions. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.",

          "authors": "Lyn M. van Swol, Ika Dai, Bret Shaw, Gavin Dehnert, Rachel A. Hutchins",
          "abstract": "Effective risk communication about per-and-polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is essential due to health risks and low public awareness. Guided by the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) and the Transtheoretical Model (Stages of Change), this study examined how risk-based messages, which include threat and efficacy, influence behavioral intention, advice outcomes, and perceived importance. An experimental survey manipulating threat (high/low) and efficacy (high/low) on 419 municipal water users in Wisconsin found that intentions to reduce PFAS exposure were higher in high-efficacy than low-efficacy messages, especially among those in later stages of change. Perceived importance was higher in the high health-threat condition than in the low-threat condition. Findings emphasize the need to include strong efficacy cues in risk messaging and tailor public health messages to individuals’ readiness for behavior change.",

          "authors": "Chloe Mortenson, Erik C. Nisbet, R. Kelly Garrett",
          "abstract": "American public discourse about online misinformation often exaggerates its prevalence and persuasiveness, potentially harming Americans’ evaluations of democratic governance. This project uses two studies conducted during the 2020 and 2022 elections to test whether the presumed prevalence/persuasiveness of online misinformation (P3OM)—the perception that online misinformation is both widespread and persuasive—undermines Americans’ satisfaction with democracy. Fixed-effects regression analysis of an eight-wave online panel survey reveals that both dimensions of P3OM are correlated with reduced democratic satisfaction. A follow-up online survey experiment provides evidence that exposure to messages about online misinformation reduces democratic satisfaction. Theoretical implications and strategies for reducing the presumed influence of online misinformation on democratic satisfaction are discussed.",

          "authors": "Tianru Guan, Xiaotong Chen",
          "abstract": "Nuanced studies have scrutinized the facilitative role of digital media in fostering political deliberation and in contributing to the prospect of democratization in (semi-) authoritarian societies. This study illuminates a less-explored facet of non-democratic contexts’ digital politics by shedding light on discourse quality in cyberspace. Guided by Gastil and Black’s analytical–social framework of deliberation, we propose an integrated analytical model comprising seven dimensions and employ a case study approach combined with supervised machine learning to analyze Chinese netizens’ digital engagement with the public policy of “delaying retirement age” on the popular Q&amp;A platform. The findings reveal deliberative virtues—topic relevance, rationality, and civility—alongside a low presence of political alienation and minimal institutional alignment, suggesting generally strong analytical performance. In contrast, the social dimension, represented by argument reciprocity and transpositional consideration, remains weak, reflecting a lack of sustained interaction. Based on these empirical results, we coin the concept of the “ solo of deliberator ” to describe a pattern of online deliberation where analytical reasoning prevails while social engagement is subdued. Implications for deliberative democracy in non-democratic nations are discussed.",

          "authors": "Luca Manucci, Hugo Marcos-Marne, Yani Kartalis",
          "abstract": "The rising electoral support for far-right parties has sparked vibrant debates about the sociopolitical dynamics driving this phenomenon. This paper investigates a crucial yet underexplored dimension: the interplay between media consumption, authoritarian nostalgia, and far-right voting behaviour. Focusing on Spain and Portugal – two countries with distinct yet comparable histories of authoritarian rule – survey data analyses suggest that readers of ABC in Spain and Correio da Manhã (CdM) in Portugal may develop higher levels of authoritarian nostalgia, which in turn correlates with a higher probability to support VOX and Chega, respectively. A content analysis conducted on these newspapers indicates that this pattern may be driven more by the tone adopted by the tabloid (CdM) and conservative ( ABC ) newspapers when discussing the authoritarian past rather than by higher levels of authoritarian nostalgia compared to other newspapers. This study contributes to political communication research by highlighting a mechanism through which media narratives shape historical perceptions and electoral choices.",

          "authors": "Seonhye Noh, Stuart Soroka",
          "abstract": "Prior work shows that passive news engagement, such as selection and consumption, exhibits strong news selectivity. Far less attention has been given to more active forms of news engagement, however. News commentary, an active form of engagement, may reflect cross-cutting engagement rather than pro-attitudinal selectivity, given its expressive and often confrontational nature. Using ten years of commenting data from South Korea’s largest news aggregator—amounting to over 250 million comments posted by approximately six million users—and a deep-learning content analysis to classify political attitudes and hostility, we examine whether hostile commentary is indeed characterized by cross-cutting patterns across both content and source levels. We specifically analyze whether users comment on counter-attitudinal news stories and whether hostile commenters are structurally confined within fragmented outlet clusters in co-engagement media networks. Findings show that hostile commenters are more likely to cross boundaries by targeting opposing news stories and exhibit weaker echo chamber structures, reflecting cross-cutting engagement beyond their clusters. This pattern is especially pronounced in political and societal domains. In today’s media environment, hostility and opposition may ironically disrupt, rather than reinforce, echo chambers.",
