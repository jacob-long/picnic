          "authors": "Zexin Ma, Xiaoli Nan",
          "abstract": "This systematic review of reviews aimed to determine whether and the extent to which narratives were persuasive. Our analysis of 30 systematic reviews revealed an overall persuasive advantage of narratives with a few nuances. First, the evidence was mixed when narratives were compared to statistics. In contrast, narratives showed greater persuasiveness when compared to other types of control. Second, patient narratives aided medical decision-making more than statistics or information without patient narratives. Exposure to entertainment narratives was effective in promoting health behavior change. Third, several potentially important moderators, such as context, health topics, and research design, were identified. Fourth, while the quality of reviews varied, recent reviews exhibited higher quality. Directions for future research are discussed.",

          "title": "Meta-music and the sonic storytelling of Baldur’s Gate 3",
          "authors": "Thomas Studley",
          "abstract": "The video game Baldur’s Gate 3 adapts the fictional setting and rule systems of the classic tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons &amp; Dragons . For most of its branching three-act story, the music of Baldur’s Gate 3 serves the conventional nondiegetic purpose of supporting narrative immersion and communicating key gameplay information to players. However, Baldur’s Gate 3 also employs a range of metareferential musical devices which foreground the artificiality of the medium with varying impacts on the player experience. This article explores how the use of ‘meta-music’ in Baldur’s Gate 3 contributes to its digital representation of the tabletop roleplaying experience while also navigating the anti-illusionistic risks that this entails for immersive storytelling. I begin by reviewing the established relationship between music and immersive storytelling across video games and tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) alike. I next consider the metacommunicative nature of TTRPGs and how this aligns with the unique potentials of metareferential music within interactive contexts. The article then proceeds with a detailed accounting of the diverse meta-musical techniques encountered in Baldur’s Gate 3, from musical easter eggs and transdiegetic leitmotifs to villains who perform their own nondiegetic theme music. I argue that these strategies evoke the aesthetic experience of playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons by eliciting states of heightened meta-awareness and open creative experimentation that characterise TTRPGs. In doing so, the ‘meta-music’ of Baldur’s Gate 3 bridges the extra- and intratextual worlds to support a specific interactional immersion that succeeds, in most cases, to deepen the storytelling experience. I conclude by arguing for further research into player perceptions of metareferential music and considering what the case study of Baldur’s Gate 3 reveals about the study of video game music at large.",

          "abstract": "Game live streaming has become a major component of global game culture. Through interview data with Japanese game live streamers, this paper offers a first consideration of Japanese-language game streaming and its associated cultural norms, expectations, and streamer perspectives. We firstly show that Japanese game streamers mostly stream anonymously, and interrogate this preference and situate it within wider contexts of Japanese internet culture, gaming culture, and societal stigmas. Secondly we show Japanese game streamers do not only appeal to native Japanese speakers, but draw in viewers from both English-language and Chinese-language backgrounds. We examine this in the context of the widespread cultural perception outside Japan of Japanese ‘otherness’, demonstrating instead that Japanese game streamers are well integrated with global flows of game streaming. We therefore present a picture of a linguistic-cultural game streaming context that is in many ways familiar, yet also highly distinctive.",

          "abstract": "This article discusses the domestication of remote-controlled sex toys within the online multiplayer sex game 3DXChat (SexGame Devil 2012) after their partnership with Lovense (Hytto) in May 2021. Under the title ‘Virtual pleasure made real’, both companies re-branded longstanding promises for the ‘future of sex’ for their consumers by converging different kinds of technologies and influencing sex-playing practices. In order to understand players’ perspectives, I primarily analyzed publications posted on 3DXChat official forum related to the partnership, which were complemented by other materials and participant observations of a two-year-long online ethnography within the sex game. The findings suggest that players were surprised and sceptical about the success of domestication. There was limited data supporting a modification of sex-playing practices, though they speculated who would benefit the most. In sum, it seems that the consumption and domestication of sexual objects in a technological setting were not as impactful as was expected, particularly in a sociocultural context of a global pandemic, which encouraged the interrelation of play and sex.",

          "abstract": "Mass media are often portrayed by populist politicians as biased, elitist, and antagonist of the people. This study uses a social identity theory framework to examine the relationship between four dimensions of populist attitudes and attitudes towards mass media. Findings from a two-wave panel survey of the Italian adult population (W1 = 1,107, W2 = 832) confirm that anti-elite attitudes have negative effects on media evaluations and media trust. Anti out-group attitudes have detrimental effects for evaluations of media quality, while they enhance trust in commercial news and trust in right-wing tabloids. People with strong attitudes related to homogeneity of the people evaluate the quality of news reporting positively and they tend to trust right-wing tabloids.",

          "authors": "Louise Luxton, Djamila Jabra, Daniela Braun",
          "abstract": "Right-wing populist parties (RWPPs) across Europe are increasingly politicising anti-feminist positions on gender and sexuality issues. However, little is known about how this mobilisation translates into media coverage. We argue that RWPPs’ polarising positions appeal to news values like conflict and sensationalism, leading to greater visibility, particularly compared to traditional issue owners that promote gender equality. We conduct a quantitative content analysis of party manifestos and six months of newspaper coverage during the 2024 European Parliament elections in Germany to examine whether media attention on gender issues corresponds with parties’ manifesto emphasis and whether the RWPP Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) is disproportionately visible. Our findings show that the AfD promoted distinctly negative gender positions and received more gender-related coverage than any other party. While mostly negative in tone, this coverage amplifies the party's anti-feminist discourse, with broader implications for gender equality and the role of news media in democratic societies.",

          "authors": "Eleonora Esposito, Silvia Semenzin",
          "abstract": "This paper draws on a research study investigating technology-facilitated gender-based violence (TFGBV) targeting feminist influencers – referred to as ‘influactivists’ – on Instagram in Italy. Using a feminist ethnographic approach, semi-structured interviews with four prominent influactivists reveal how digital platforms serve as both tools for empowerment and arenas for misogynistic abuse. These women face diverse forms of TFGBV, including harassment, verbal abuse, mass-reporting, hyper-sexualised attacks, and coordinated assaults by manosphere communities, media figures, and mainstream influencers, all aimed at silencing feminist voices and reinforcing resistance to gender equality. The study underscores the serious toll this violence takes on activists’ mental health, digital presence, and self-expression, often resulting in self-censorship. In response, influactivists deploy resilience strategies – such as digital self-defence, community support, and content moderation – although institutional backing from social media platforms remains minimal. The research also uncovers internal frictions within feminist digital activism, where neoliberal pressures and perfectionist standards complicate visibility and expose activists to increased scrutiny. Ultimately, the paper exposes the paradox of digital feminism: while online spaces enable feminist expression, they simultaneously magnify gendered vulnerabilities. Addressing these contradictions demands stronger networks of solidarity and systemic action to counteract online misogyny and sustain feminist political engagement.",

Drawing on feminist and deliberative pedagogies and utilising the Participatory Action Learning and Action Research method, the project engaged over 400 students from five European universities. By creating safe and collaborative learning spaces, highlighting the meaningful visibility of students’ work, and fostering participation and inclusion, the project addressed intersectional inequalities in media representation and empowered students to become agents of social change. Further qualitative analysis of student outputs reveals the transformative potential of feminist pedagogies in cultivating gender-aware professionals and amplifying student voices. The project highlights the role of education in challenging systemic barriers to gender equality, promoting intercultural dialogue, and advancing democratic values within media practices.",

Through interviews with Finnish game industry professionals, the research reveals that data-driven work practices evoke a wide range of emotions, ranging from pleasure and satisfaction to insecurity and frustration. Data can act both as a helpful workmate and as a source of professional conflict and frustration, impacting the worker's sense of professionalism. Data-driven work also compels workers to individually confront ethical questions. Our findings highlight the interplay between creative work processes and data analytics, emphasizing the emotional labor that game industry professionals need to handle in a data-driven work culture. Additionally, the research addresses ethical considerations and the emotional work required to reconcile public perceptions of data usage. The study contributes to the broader understanding of emotional work in new data-intensive professions and advocates for more emotionally sustainable practices in data-driven game development.",

We aimed to analyze and depict different elements of life governance mediated by games that use rail infrastructure in their main narrative arcs, mechanics, and esthetics. We chose rail because of its well-documented role in colonial and imperial projects of modernity which have become the objects of game representations. Analyzing how games mediate rail infrastructure is therefore important for understanding how they mediate biopolitical projects, which elements can be traced as manifestations of biopolitics in these games, and what role they play in representations of ideas such as nationality, progress, history, and modernity.",

          "abstract": "Empirical research connects the News Finds Me perception (NFM) with undesirable democratic outcomes. Consequently, high-NFM individuals may be more vulnerable to political misinformation than low-NFM individuals. In this two-wave, preregistered news judgment study (N = 867 US adults), we explore the possibility that high-NFM individuals overestimate their ability to detect misinformation—a phenomenon grounded in the Dunning–Kruger effect, whereby individuals with limited competence fail to recognize their shortcomings. As hypothesized, high-NFM (vs. low-NFM) participants reported greater overconfidence in their false news discernment ability—an effect driven by their objectively lower discernment ability. We also find that the more overconfident high-NFM people were, the greater their intentions to engage with false and true news, although their overconfidence was especially likely to predict intentions to engage with false news. These findings suggest the NFM plays a dually negative role in promoting susceptibility to misinformation, highlighting the need for targeted intervention efforts.",

However, their openness, anonymity, and lack of effective regulation have also contributed to a disorderly online environment and frequent incidents of cyber-violence. This study focuses on comment texts related to cyber-violence incidents and aims to identify and classify three types of discussants: facilitators, mediators, and bystanders. Design/methodology/approach The study constructs a feature matrix by integrating inherent basic characteristics, objective thematic characteristics, and subjective emotional characteristics. It then employs a range of classification techniques—including traditional machine learning, deep learning, ensemble methods, and hybrid models—to perform group classification of discussants. Findings The best-performing model achieves an accuracy exceeding 70%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The study also reveals distinct differences among discussant groups and their respective roles in the propagation of cyber-violence. Originality/value This study contributes to the understanding and classification of online discussant groups, enhances the interpretability of classification models, facilitates relationship analysis, uncovers the rules governing public opinion spread, and provides insights for preventing and managing cyber-violence.",

          "authors": "Cuiyou Yao, Lin Yu, Yan He, Dong Wang, Yanhong Yang, Dongpu Fu",
          "abstract": "Purpose In social networks, derivative topics derived from original topics are becoming increasingly general, and the interaction between derivative topics and original topics makes public opinions increasingly complex and unstable. This paper aims to study the evolution of online opinions under the interaction between original and derivative topics. Design/methodology/approach This paper establishes an online opinion dynamics model based on a two-layer complex network, consisting of original and derivative topic layers. In the two-layer network, the interaction threshold between netizens and the external environment is set dynamically. Secondly, by setting herd mentality, response subject, and media parameters, the internal psychological factors and external environmental factors are involved in the model. Finally, simulation experiments are conducted using actual online social network data to examine the effects of topic adherence, relative clout of topics, and external environmental information on the opinions related to the original and derivative topics. Findings Topic relationships are crucial in the interaction between original and derivative topics. Derivative topics that are highly related to the original topic will have a greater impact on each other’s dissemination. Those with high relative clout can influence the original topic more rapidly. Therefore, when encountering derivative topics that are highly related to the original topic or have high relative clout, relevant departments should give greater and more timely attention. In addition, due to topic relationships, governing a single topic always leads to an increase in negative opinions on another topic, which may turn low-clout topics into high-clout ones. Thus, the response subject can actively explore the commonalities between derivative and original topics and intervene in common issues to enhance effectiveness. Research limitations/implications First, our model did not consider forgetting mechanisms and node decay effects which may affect the long-term dissemination of information and the intensity of interaction between nodes. Second, we treat the response subject’s credibility and information quality as fixed parameters. Third, we employ a rough estimation method to assess topic adherence. Practical implications Due to topic relationships, the governance of a single topic always leads to an increase in negative opinions on another topic, which may turn low-clout topics into high-clout topics. Thus, the response subject can actively explore the commonalities between the derivative and original topics and intervene in common issues to be more effective. Originality/value This paper explores the interaction scenario between the original and derivative topics, providing valuable insights for more complex public opinion governance issues.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study investigates the impact of organizational recovery strategies on user trust repair following an information privacy violation incident as well as the mediating mechanism and boundary condition. Design/methodology/approach We conducted an online scenario-based experiment employing a 2 (recovery strategies: functional vs affective) × 2 (privacy violation type: intentional vs accidental) between-subjects design. The experiment was conducted in China using 290 randomly selected platform users. Findings The functional recovery strategy is more effective in restoring user trust than the affective recovery strategy and recovery satisfaction mediates the relationship between recovery strategies and post-trust. The findings also confirmed that functional repair is more effective than affective repair for accidental privacy violations, though the effectiveness of these two strategies for intentional privacy violations did not differ significantly. Research limitations/implications Companies should prioritize functional repair following privacy violations and strive to improve user satisfaction with recovery measures. Furthermore, they should choose recovery strategies based on the type of privacy violation to restore user trust. Originality/value This study is among the first to examine the relative effectiveness of functional and affective recovery strategies as privacy violation recovery actions. Moreover, this research applies attribution theory to the context of privacy violations and investigates the moderating role of privacy violation type.",

          "authors": "Patrick McCarthy, David Sammon, Ibrahim Alhassan",
          "abstract": "Purpose The pace of Digital Transformation (DT) is accelerating within organizations, and this has blossomed into a commentary around what we refer to as “doing” DT. Despite this trend, it is hard to find a collection of Critical Success Factors (CSFs) for DT, from either the academic literature or trade press. For the purposes of this research, we define DT as the strategic use of emergent and emerging technologies to make an organization more customer-focused, innovative and efficient, through optimizing processes, data and people, disrupting business and operational models to deliver value to all stakeholders. Therefore, the objective of this theory-building research is to explore the CSFs for DT in a pre-digital organization. Design/methodology/approach For the purposes of this theory-building research we take inspiration from features of the Gioia Methodology. Therefore, we pose the following research question: What are the CSFs for DT that impact positively on the outcome of a DT initiative within a pre-digital organization? To answer this question, we code (following an inductive open, axial and selective coding approach) the stories of 16 key informants (DT leaders). We also survey a further 30 DT leaders to evaluate the importance of our findings (the degree to which each of our nine CSFs for DT are deemed “essential”). Findings We present nine CFSs for DT in a pre-digital organization as a conceptual model. We also evaluate these CSFs for DT, and this evaluation reveals that seven of our CSFs for DT are deemed essential. Furthermore, our evaluation also reveals three interesting patterns, one of which highlights the importance of three specific CSFs that impact on “Culture Change” when “doing” DT in a pre-digital organization. Originality/value This paper is unique in its approach and the CSFs presented can sharpen the DT focus of academia and practice. Our contribution advances the first comprehensive conceptualization of the “essential” CSFs for DT in a pre-digital organization, thereby strengthening the relevance for practitioners striving for the best possible DT initiative outcome.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This research examines how information and communication technology (ICT)-enabled interactions influence conflict, joint action, and thus cooperative performance in supply chains. Design/methodology/approach We adopt a mixed-methods approach that uses both qualitative and quantitative methods. We conduct a grounded theory study of 18 interviews to identify two predominant platforms for ICT-enabled interactions among contemporary firms: interorganizational information systems (IOSs) and public social media (PSM). We then develop a research model and test six hypotheses with field survey data from 520 manufacturing firms. Findings ICT-enabled interactions reduce conflict and promote joint action in supply chains. More importantly, whereas IOS-enabled interaction is more effective in promoting joint action, PSM-enabled interaction is more effective in mitigating conflict. In addition, conflict and joint action fully mediate the effect of IOS-enabled interaction on cooperative performance, but only partially mediate the impact of PSM-enabled interaction. Research limitations/implications This research is an essential investigation of the impacts of the concurrent use of IOSs and PSM as interaction platforms, showing a new mechanism through which ICT-enabled interactions improve performance. Originality/value This research highlights the different effects of ICT-enabled interactions and provides practical insights for managers to deploy and leverage different ICT platforms in supply chains.",

          "abstract": "Since the advent of social network sites, researchers have investigated how and why users share personal information online. Yet, the replicability of individual findings remains unclear. We addressed this gap by closely replicating three seminal studies: Krasnova et al.’s (2010) study on the privacy calculus, Vitak’s (2012) analysis of the impact of context collapse, and Dienlin and Trepte’s (2015) investigation of the privacy paradox. While only 32.5% of the original effects replicated exactly across the three studies, 67.5% were significant and in line with the original direction. Despite this overall replication success, the prominent negative privacy concerns and self-disclosure link did not replicate and became positive instead. Additional specification curve analyses revealed that the strength of this relationship is contingent on a variety of analytical decisions. The findings offer insights into the replicability of survey-based privacy research, highlighting the role of replication in a dynamic research landscape.",

Leveraging the propositions of balance theory as suggested by Grizzard, Francemone et al. (2020), our findings demonstrate that moral information about a single character biases perceptions and judgments of other characters within the same narrative. Beyond replicating binary comparative judgments between characters, similar to past work on character interdependence, we show that the relational information conveyed by a character network can reveal how interdependent effects between several characters will manifest. Specifically, our results demonstrate that characters are either contrasted or assimilated to one another based on the relationship valences communicated by the narrative’s character network. Extrapolating from these findings, we discuss several aspects of character networks that should be considered to further develop the concept of character interdependence.",

          "abstract": "Identity construction is a continuous process that permeates all social life. Drawing from intercultural communication scholarship and the Bakhtinian perspective on the construction of the self, we suggest that identity is constructed in talk through the interplay of socially constructed, ideologically imbued similarities and differences and propose the blocking and threading analysis (BTA) method to study this process. Blocking refers to constructing differences and social boundaries, whereas threading creates similarities, unity, and commonality. These practices are intertwined, and we argue that identity emerges from the constant shifts between the two. The four-step analytical process entails identifying positioning, recognizing connected utterances, interpreting blocking and threading, and examining their shifts. We illustrate the analytical force of BTA by an analysis of an extract from a focus group discussion among an interprofessional healthcare team. The method requires further application to different datasets, but it shows promise in terms of bringing new insights into research on identity construction.",

          "abstract": "One of the rare uncontested contemporary public facts is that especially Western academic and popular discourse became preoccupied with problematizing public untruth, misbelief, and distrust in the wake of Brexit, Trump, and the Covid-19 pandemic, a conjuncture more controversially referred to as “post-truth politics.” Three diverse books under review here can be gingerly approached under that post-truth banner, so long as it means a public anxiety about the possibility of securing publicly accepted facts (as opposed to, say, Oxford dictionaries’ definition). Considering them together affords us a broader global and deeper historical, social, and psychological perspective on the conjuncture. Dannagal Goldthwaite Young’s Wrong encourages us to see what appears as a perplexing polarization of politics and entrenched (mis)beliefs as, instead, a distilled product of media-economic logics and the political exploitation of basic psychological needs for agency, control, comprehension, and/or community. Sarah Banet-Weiser and Kathryn Claire Higgins’ Believability—engaging with the post-#MeToo and post-truth political entanglements—explores how disbelief in factual accounts has always been reserved for women and other structurally demoted truth-tellers in historically specific “economies of believability”. In Spin Dictators, meanwhile, Sergei Guriev and Daniel Triesman draw attention to shifting styles of dictatorship, from bloodily repressive autocratic and totalitarian historical examples—the test cases of Arendt’s proto-post-truth politics around the “fragility” of public facts—to something more liberal-democratic in terms of style and strategy.",

          "abstract": "Given that communicative phenomena are inherently processual, the scarcity of a longitudinal narrative perspective is an evident lacuna in communication research. This article argues that to explore communicative processes as a longitudinal experience, shaped by the constant tension between structure and agency, researchers can elicit and analyze stories that information producers and consumers construct in their own words across time. Consequently, the article explores the implementation of Longitudinal Qualitative Interviewing (LQI), the repeated interviewing of the same individuals at two (or more) time points, in the study of media. It considers the methodological and conceptual insights that could be drawn from such an application, and the ways in which the unique affordances of LQI enhance the validity of qualitative communication research. Our discussion of the implementation of LQI is anchored in an exploration of occupational life histories of 39 Israeli journalists over the span of a decade.",

This article analyzes the artisanal imaginaries of the Australian Made Campaign to explore how the campaign taps into the growing cultural desirability of the handmade and the artisanal, and heightened concerns about the future sustainability of mass production. Focusing on the discursive and aesthetic approach of the campaign’s Facebook posts, we show how the campaign contributes to a wider mainstreaming of neo-craft as a dominant mode for promoting production in a national context where onshore manufacturing has long been in decline. We argue that the campaign’s media repertoires work to “domesticate” large-scale manufacturing via emotive appeals to traditional artisanal tropes (“love,” “family,” “care”) to tap into the zeitgeist appeal of locally-specific and knowable scales of production.",

          "abstract": "This study examined whether accuracy nudges and content veracity labels enhance people’s discernment in believing and sharing true versus false news. Participants in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Hong Kong were shown five true and five false social media posts in random order. Two true posts and two false posts were randomly assigned “True” and “False” labels, respectively. Multilevel regression models indicated that accuracy nudges and veracity labels had no direct effects on the perceived accuracy of posts or willingness to share them, though the interaction of the “False” label and accuracy nudge significantly reduced the perceived accuracy of and intention to share false news across the samples. Post hoc analyses further uncovered contingent effects based on individual differences, including partisan identity in the United States and conspiratorial thinking in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. The findings demonstrate the efficacy of combined countermeasures in attenuating the effects of misinformation.",

          "authors": "Douglas A Parry, Bronwyne Coetzee",
          "abstract": "Building on the idea that subjective evaluations of social media use (SMU) may shape well-being effects, this study investigated how two “social media mindsets”—agency (perceived control over SMU) and valence (perceived effects of SMU)—relate to self-reported and logged SMU, and four well-being indicators (depression, anxiety, stress, and life satisfaction) in a South African sample of young adults (N = 1,858; M age = 21.01). Agency mindsets were negatively correlated with SMU and positively with well-being, while valence mindsets were associated with higher SMU but not with well-being. Logged SMU showed weaker associations with mindsets and well-being than self-reported SMU, suggesting differences between perceived and actual behavior. The findings replicate, extend, and in some cases contradict prior research, emphasizing how users’ sense of control is more important for well-being than SMU duration or perceptions of its effects, and that more work is needed to understand whether the “mindsets” concept is fruitful.",

          "abstract": "Latinos living in the U.S. must negotiate traditional Latino cultural expectations while simultaneously navigating U.S. norms around body image. Insights into Latino family communication about body image and food may explain lower rates of receiving care and identify key areas of interventions in this area. Therefore, the current study explores the perceived content, strategies, and justifications of the messages Latino adult children receive about weight. Iterative analysis of written responses ( N = 60) identified three key perceptions of parent-child communication and message internalization: (a) the content of weight-related messages, (b) the strategies for communicating those messages, and (c) justifications or reasons for parents communicating messages about weight. Results reveal that adult children often describe their parents as having good intentions. However, these weight-related messages often had negative implications for the receiver, as participants described feeling their value in the family being tied to weight or developing disordered eating habits. These themes underscore the role parents play in the body image and eating socialization process for their children and the negative impacts this process may have, regardless of intent.",

          "abstract": "This investigation examines whether eldercare norms in emerging adulthood are directly and indirectly formed through an intergenerational religious pathway. Data derived from 231 grandchildren and their matched grandparents from the 2021–22 wave of the Longitudinal Study of Generations. Religiosity was defined as a composite consisting of religious service attendance, subjective religious intensity, and perceived importance of religion in daily life. Eldercare norms were assessed based on an evaluation of the responsibility that adult children should have to provide support and care to older parents in six areas of assistance. Intermediate factors following from religiosity include grandchildren’s altruism values and emotional closeness to grandparents. Structural equation modelling was used to examine direct and indirect pathways linking these factors. Results indicate significant continuity in religiosity between grandparents and grandchildren. Additionally, we found that the positive association between grandchildren’s religiosity and eldercare norms is fully mediated through an ideational route of general empathy toward vulnerable individuals and a relational route of emotional bonding with grandparents. Our findings highlight how religious involvement of grandchildren forms indirect pathways of influence that ultimately shape their view of parental caregiving as a filial responsibility.",

          "abstract": "Withdrawal, meaning emotional disengagement or the “silent treatment,” compromises couple relationship satisfaction and well-being. In contrast, intimate interactions between partners —characterized by self-disclosure and understanding — promote warmth, mutual knowledge, and satisfaction. The benefits of intimacy may thereby reduce partners’ tendencies to withdraw after a conflict. Both partners in 217 committed, cohabiting couples (434 individuals) completed 14-day diaries reporting whether they had a conflict each day, intimacy in their interactions, and the extent to which either partner withdrew after conflict. Couples who experienced more intimacy, whether on days with conflict or on average during the study, withdrew less after their conflicts. Of intimacy’s two dimensions, understanding was a stronger predictor of reduced withdrawals than self-disclosure. Lastly, couples withdrew more following serious conflict. However, the more intimacy they experienced during the study, the less they withdrew. Particularly, more intimate couples remained less withdrawn even when conflict expanded beyond the initial problem (but not after contemptuous communication). Overall, the findings underscore the benefits of intimate communication in sustaining partners’ emotional availability in the face of conflict by reducing partners’ withdrawals.",

          "abstract": "Social support is one of the most reliable predictors of well-being. One of its facets, received social support (RSS), pertains to social interactions that provide actual assistance. Cultural context is important in appreciating RSS; however, existing conceptualizations are based on western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) contexts. This mixed methods study aimed to explore the concept of RSS in the Philippine context. Study 1 aimed to describe the characteristics of Filipino RSS through a qualitative survey. Five themes were generated from the responses of 424 Filipino adults. Study 2 examined the dimensions of RSS. Items were constructed using themes generated in Study 1 and RSS facets in the current literature (i.e., emotional, instrumental, informational). A total of 198 participants completed an online survey which asked them to rate the frequency at which they have received the specified supportive behaviors. Exploratory factor analysis surfaced six facets of received social support that cover behaviors that (1) provide encouragement and increase one’s sense of efficacy and self-worth; (2) provide a sense of emotional relief through empathy and companionship; (3) facilitate a sense of community; (4) provide information, guidance, and instruction on how to solve one’s problems; (5) provide timely practical support; and, (6) provide relief to the recipient by backing them up when they fail to deal with their problems successfully. Findings indicated that while Filipino received social support facets do not significantly differ from Euro-American-centric conceptualizations, they are infused with cultural aspects that focus on social relationships and social harmony, and self-efficacy.",

Each form represents a communicative figuration encompassing a specific audience construction, unique relationship practices, and a certain frame of relevance. Emerging forms—in response to the challenges facing journalism—complement traditional role-based relationships to a general public that is merely imagined by emotionally rooted connections to specific social groups and individuals who are observed and even interacted with.",

          "authors": "Bissie Anderson",
          "abstract": "Acknowledging the networked nature of journalism and shifting power relations between actors in the hybrid media system, this article invokes the metaphor of “the curtain” that separates journalists and external actors/forces in discussions on journalistic autonomy (Coddington, 2015) and applies it to the engaged journalism practices of four media startups. It places “the curtain” in the hybrid media systems paradigm and its relational ontology (Chadwick, 2017) to examine to what extent that concept applies to engaged journalism, a participatory media practice that, by definition, involves publics in journalistic processes. Drawing on interviews with engaged journalism producers in Pakistan, Romania, Malaysia, and the UK, this comparative cross-border study explores the power relations within the actor constellations involved in journalistic co-creation. The outlets examined favour a relational approach to knowledge production, in which they prioritise mutual listening and learning—together&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with their communities. However, there is still a separation between journalists and audiences/publics. Examining the power negotiations that shape engaged journalism in different parts of the world, this study sheds light on the unique texture of each hybrid media space of co-creation. It offers a nuanced conceptualisation of hybridity, suggesting that engagement can lend itself to varying degrees of openness. The study findings challenge idealistic notions of participation by showing that, even in engaged journalism practice, participation remains tightly controlled by journalists and is subject to their negotiation of capacity-enabling and capacity-limiting forces within the constraints of the context-specific material realities.",

          "abstract": "Content moderation plays a pivotal role in structuring online speech, but the human labour and the everyday decision-making process in content moderation remain underexamined. Informed by in-depth interviews with 16 content moderators in India, in this research, we analyse the decision-making process of commercial content moderators through the concept of sensemaking. We argue that moderation decisions are made in the context of the industry’s plural policies and efficiency requirements. An interplay of four cognitive processes of pattern identification, subjective perceptions, shared knowledge, and process optimization influences the final judgement. Once sense is enacted in the decision-making process, the sensibilities are retained by the adept moderator for future moderation decisions. Visibilizing the labour process behind commercial content moderation, we argue that everyday moderation decisions unfold in a socio-technical and economic assemblage wherein decisions are decontextualised and plausibility driven rather than consistency driven.",

          "abstract": "Social norms shape and are simultaneously established through communication processes. While instant messaging (IM) groups are nowadays prominent spaces for daily communication, we have only little knowledge of how norms function within them. To address this gap, this study analyzes norm formation in WeChat neighborhood groups during the Covid-19 lockdown in Shanghai. We conceptualize these groups as location-based meso-spaces ; situated between the public and private realms, they underscore the importance of social norms in navigating social interactions. Building on 20 semi-structured interviews, combined with walk-through protocols, we identify what social norms emerge and how they are formed. We find that group norms develop through in-group interactions facilitated by the technological and social affordances of WeChat groups, and that they could derive from shared moral values and “group prototypes.” The results highlight that the lockdown and the Chinese socio-cultural and political environment play a significant role in shaping in-group norms.",

Findings show that participatory governance and peer-enforced social norms are crucial for creating a strong sense of community, even after controlling for active, frequent community engagement. In contrast, merely enforcing rules through formal control mechanisms does not significantly enhance community strength. Inclusive governance also helps mitigate challenges posed by larger community sizes, supporting a strong sense of community at scale. However, the interaction between participatory governance and social control reveals a complex tension, where high member involvement may dilute the positive effects of peer-enforced norms. These insights underscore the necessity of a balanced, configurational governance approach, integrating both participatory processes and social control to bolster community cohesion. This study offers a more nuanced understanding of how online governance shapes community belonging and provides practical guidelines for designing more inclusive and cohesive digital spaces.",

          "abstract": "Search engines are both frequently used and widely trusted sources of current political information. While research has examined the different stages of information seeking via search, the question of how political preferences and sociodemographic factors impact political online search has received less attention. In particular, the way in which attitudinal factors, such as sentiment toward a politician or interest in their personal life motivate information seeking have not been widely studied. We present findings from a panel study that combines browser tracking data with survey results for 1863 German participants. Our results suggest that both sympathy and antipathy toward a selection of popular politicians is predictive of searching for them. Queries also vary in their composition, with searches for female politicians highlighting their personal lives and physical attributes somewhat more often than for males. We conclude that the role of “soft” factors in motivating information seeking on political actors remains underexplored.",

It first outlines how socioeconomic factors promote blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. Against this background, and based on scholarship in cultural communication, anthropology, and critical platform studies, the article illustrates how sociocultural frames shape the interpretation and enactment of blockchain-based gameplay affordances. A Grounded Theory analysis of interviews and documents reveals that players identify persistent access and ownership as technical affordances, performing them through the cultural frame of cockfighting and its digital economy version, the side hustle. The study challenges universalist notions of Web3 adoption, highlighting how technical affordances both support and disrupt sociocultural and economic reproduction through narratives of family, competition, and inclusivity. The research calls for comparative studies on how platform corporations structure societies in emerging economies, how platforms exploit culture as use value, and how adopters strategically utilize Web3 technologies.",

          "abstract": "Protesters in recent years have been making a somewhat novel demand: they are asking journalists to blur their faces in news coverage of public demonstrations. This article investigates this demand to explore how new surveillance technologies and the political economy of media are complicating the ethics of visual journalism. Reviewing 26 articles from news outlets, trade publications, and blogs published between May 2020 and October 2024 that discussed protesters’ demand, the study considers three themes: visibility and surveillance in digital media; the ethical contradictions that visual journalists navigate while documenting dissent; and the relationships among journalists, movements, and political-economic power structures. The article contrasts Enlightenment ideals with an ethic of care to understand journalists’ views on transparency and truth, concluding that the uneven power dynamics among protesters, journalists and the state raise important questions about the documentation, preservation and circulation of dissent.",

Building upon Guy Debord’s theory of the spectacle, I propose the concept of “platformed racial spectacle” to theorize such online phenomena: an aggregate of images voluntarily shared online, facilitated by the social media platform affordances and its sociality culture, fabricating the mythical connections between race, DNA, bodily traits, and geographies. Indicative of the racial structure and racial formations insidiously reified through such practices, the mobilization of racialization, semantics, and somatics can be found through the platformed racial spectacle and the collective practices of conjuring such a racial project. Contextualized in the subreddit r/23andme, I further explicate the emergence and existence of platformed racial spectacle, unfurl its texture and format, and expound its spectacular functionality of unification and alteration.",

Using insights from the political economy of global media and platform studies, it situates Spotify within the asymmetrical geographies of platform capitalism, where peripheral regions are more consumption markets than cultural centers. While Spotify emphasizes egalitarian access through playlisting and algorithmic tools, the findings reveal persistent inequalities shaped by “spatial gatekeeping.” Focusing on how regional actors, mediating between artists and the platform, experience these inequalities, the article draws on interviews and “scavenging” ethnography to develop a typology of “platform intermediaries,” including regional playlist editors, digital distributors, major label representatives, and music creators. These intermediaries internalize spatial gatekeeping in their practices and platform imaginaries, which reflect perceived distance from geographic and algorithmic centers and aspirations to transcend peripherality. The article offers a nuanced account of platform geography’s asymmetries as experienced from the periphery.",

          "abstract": "In 2024, Oxford University Press made ‘brain rot’ – a piece of teenage slang found primarily on the popular video sharing application TikTok – its word of the year . This announcement was received by a public discourse of media panic wherein ‘brain rot’ was understood primarily as a threat to young people’s mental and physical wellbeing. This article seeks to challenge this discourse, building on the participatory approach to children’s media scholarship to argue instead that ‘brain rot’ constitutes a complex, and historically situated, genre of participation . Drawing on empirical data from seven TikTok workshops with 16- and 17-year-olds in Oslo, ‘brain rot’ is conceptualised as a collection of related practices that (1) are childish or unserious, (2) provide no cognitive or developmental benefit, and (3) are deliberately non-productive. In this way, it can be understood as a decompression-driven genre of participation whereby young people actively resist the pressures of productivity and self-optimisation.",

Using critical discourse analysis, we identify five major sociocultural contexts in which racial information appears – Appearance , Ability , Culture , Social Equity , and Manner . We found that the participatory nature of YouTube produces a multifaceted representation of race-related content in its search outputs, characterized by enduring historical biases, aggregated discrimination, and interracial tensions, while simultaneously depicting minority resistance and aspirations of a post-racial society. We call for innovations in content moderation policy design and enforcement to address existing racial harms in YouTube search outputs.",

A total of 140,593 revisions (by 48,643 editors) of 76,525 sentences in 537 Wikipedia articles related to climate change were analyzed using text mining, natural language processing, survival analysis, and meta-analysis.

          "abstract": "Visual art is increasingly created by generative artificial intelligence (generative AI). This study, conducted online with 470 US participants, investigated whether exposure to art attributed to AI may influence aesthetic appreciation, perceptions of AI mind, and evaluations of AI (acceptance of AI as an artist, evaluation of AI as an identity and realistic threat) and of art careers. Exposure to art introduced as generated by AI (vs a human artist) reduced appreciation. No significant impact was observed on the other dependent variables. For ostensibly AI-generated art, higher appreciation was associated with more acceptance toward AI as an artist and lower levels of AI realistic threat. This suggests that mere exposure to art attributed to AI may not be sufficient to induce a change in perceptions of AI mind, evaluations of AI and of art careers, but these effects might occur if AI-attributed art is appreciated aesthetically.",

While much of the existing literature adopts a reductionist and risk-focused perspective, this article explores the complexities and variations of the child figure in this field. Through an empirical case study of a successful Swedish child influencer, we highlight how multiple representations of ‘the child’ – as professional, creative, vulnerable, and marketing subject – can coexist within a single campaign. Theoretically, we draw on complexity theory, the concept of multiplicity and the feminist idea of ‘staying with the troubles’. We argue for a more nuanced approach to studying child influencers by embracing the uncertainties and challenges involved, and acknowledge that influencing is only one of many roles children occupy in their lives. This approach encourages thinking about children in dynamic, interconnected ways, recognising the fluidity of their roles across time, space and context.",

Given this gap, we undertook an exploratory study to assess content pertaining to autistic people’s difficulties with food and eating on the leading SM app TikTok. We identified four main themes: (a) EDs and autism; (b) cognitive, sensory, and behavioral dimensions of autistic eating and body issues; (c) social, cultural, and economic aspects of autistic people’s food challenges; and (d) self-reported role of TikTok in autistic individuals’ coping with food/eating difficulties.

This study fills this gap by analyzing data from a national representative survey of 1405 US adults. Results confirmed the relationships between cognitive orientations and climate change misperceptions. While neither mainstream nor alternative social media use had a direct impact, both types of social media use conditioned the relationships between cognitive orientations and climate change misperceptions.

Citizen scientists partnered with researchers of the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment to study train noise, employing diverse data-collection methods. Interviews with participants revealed trust in this approach and outcomes, contrasting with conventional noise-pollution research. The integration of extended expertise and real-world context, coupled with the project’s iterative feedback loop, ensured that findings were accurate and locally relevant.

Because digital media environments are expected to be heterogeneous in content, the sources of trust cues, characteristics of objects of trust in science (e.g. the gender of scientists), and their impact on public trust in science may vary. In our quantitative content analysis, we identified trust cues across several sources of scientific information ( n = 906) and examined their heterogeneity in digital media environments. Our results reveal journalism as the most important source for trust cues and that scientists are the most prevalent object of trust—with female scientists being underrepresented.

          "abstract": "Digital media have played a significant role in the rise of nationalism in recent years. Existing research, however, tends to focus on more explicit or passionate expressions of nationalist feelings online. In contrast, there has been very little work on the relationship between everyday digital practices and the (re)production of national frameworks among “ordinary” citizens. To address this lacuna, this study develops a novel theoretical framework that employs insights from studies of everyday habits, temporal rhythms and “common-sense” knowledge. This framework is used to examine the everyday digital practices of ordinary people in China drawing on data from media diaries and semi-structured interviews with 45 participants. The Chinese digital infrastructure is particularly conducive to the formation of distinct national digital habits, due to its reliance on domestic platforms and the presence of the “Great Firewall” that limits access to foreign platforms. Yet, as our analysis shows, the nationalizing effects of this digital infrastructure requires “buy-in” from citizens. We first investigate how and why people’s digital activities tend to be confined to the national “walled garden” of Chinese platforms. Second, we highlight the role of WeChat as the primary node in China’s digital ecosystem and demonstrate how ordinary citizens use it, in a largely taken-for-granted manner, to sustain a plethora of nationally bounded relationships and activities. Finally, we examine the tiny number of participants that move beyond this ecosystem and their motivations for both venturing out and returning “home.”",

          "abstract": "As K-pop fans around the world participate in their fan communities in hybrid online-offline contexts, their sense of connection with artists and one another is shaped by their unique position in-between co-creators and resistors within the platform ecosystem. This article draws upon 10 months of fieldwork from 2022 to 2023 to offer a framework for how fans navigate platformization and offers a theoretical contribution to platform studies by advancing the theory of affective participation from the in-between. As a process, platformization involves the shifting of everyday experiences from offline interaction to technologically mediated interaction. For K-pop fans, platform infrastructures change participation in the realm of quantification and identification. This project delves into the relationship between K-pop fans and power structures within this contemporary capitalist system. I argue that, although fans work to creatively subvert systems of power within platformization, through navigation practices such as gatekeeping insider knowledge, community policing, and self-cooptation, they reinvent community structuring systems that serve to benefit K-pop industry leaders and platform owners. However, their creative platform use illuminates a potential for affective participation in the in-between —simultaneously subverting and supporting industry expectations. Fans’ unique relationship with industry leaders and one another demonstrate the contradictory textured affective sensations which allow them to participate in fandom in unique ways. By offering this textured approach to affective participation, this article provides meaningful footing for future research on contemporary participation in global platformized contexts.",

          "authors": "Rachel Wood",
          "abstract": "How do Instagram sustainability influencers communicate criticisms of consumer culture, and try to promote more sustainable alternatives, in the context of a platform and industry that seeks to promote consumption by design? Drawing on an ethnography of Instagram influencers who advocate “zero waste” lifestyle politics, this paper argues that a “sustainability paradox” emerges from the impossibility of aligning environmental values with the commercial norms of the influencer industry. This paradox necessitates continuous negotiation and management for influencers, and routinely excludes them from pathways to paid work. As extensive research on influencer labor has shown, sustainability influencers are far from alone in being systematically marginalized from paid work because they are not “advertiser friendly” or “brand safe” according to the capitalist norms of social media platforms and the influencer industry. The paper makes two key arguments regarding the causes of, and solutions to, this problem. First, the “paradox” faced by sustainability influencers points to the irreparable unsustainability of the influencer industry and the environmentally destructive systems of production, promotion and consumption which it exists to promote. And second, solutions to the systemic problems of exploitative influencer labor cannot be found from tweaks to labor conditions in this unsustainable industry. Instead, the paper makes a case for the value of a “post-work” approach to influencer labor, which broadens critical and political imaginaries for what “influencing” might mean outside of exclusionary and environmentally catastrophic hegemonies of promotional labor and consumption.",

          "abstract": "We advance communication theory on the relationship between online dating and psychological well-being with a nationally representative, two-wave panel survey of dating app users ( N = 521) that investigates individuals’ motives for dating and their perceived success. Results from an autoregressive structural equation model revealed people felt lonelier when they used dating apps for social approval, but not when they used them to pursue relationships. Perceived success was linked to psychological well-being: people felt lonely and less satisfied when they believed they were not attracting partners and better well-being when they felt successful. Gender differences were observed where women reported being more successful and less lonely but also more anxious about dating than men. However, men were observed to have higher life satisfaction when experiencing higher success. Our findings contribute evidence for the importance of motivations and perceptions in communication technology use and psychological well-being.",

          "authors": "Chelsea Butkowski, Frances Corry",
          "abstract": "As long-standing social media platforms reinvent themselves and new platforms emerge, recent discourses about social media describe the platform landscape as marked by rising uncertainty and volatility. This article deconstructs popular media narratives of emerging, centralized social media platforms, including TikTok, BeReal, and Threads. Through a qualitative textual analysis of mainstream press discourses, we address the current existential juncture in the social media landscape by examining normative ideals of social media usage and the visions animated by these framings. Our study finds that social media’s imagined futures are refracted through the past, surfacing the fundamental importance of nostalgia in narratives of each platform’s emergence. We describe a persistent entanglement between the ongoing production of speculative discourses about future technologies and a yearning for affective experiences of bygone platforms through the concept of nostalgic anticipation. Nostalgic anticipation provides a framework for understanding how today’s narratives of technological change create idealized visions of a digital past while eliding critiques of the social media industry.",

This article draws on a digital ethnographic approach and discourse analysis of posts to the microblogging site X (formerly Twitter) to examine uses of and metacommunication about the language of mental health. The analysis traces and snapshots how mental health language is being used to construct mental health, mental illness, and related subjects as a meaningful social object by participants on social media. The results focus on a particular practice around contesting the language and meaning of mental health designations, identities and language as a form of communication ritual that produces normative metadiscourse about mental health, what it means, and how we should understand and talk about it.",

          "authors": "Siri Frisli",
          "abstract": "This study investigates COVID-19-related misinformation on Norwegian Twitter (X), using a mixed-method approach to analyze a large corpus of 426,000 Norwegian-language tweets posted over the course of 3 years, focusing on the interplay between discursive strategies, ideological dynamics, and power relations. The quantitative analysis uses Structural Topic Modeling (STM) to identify and map the prevalence of key discourses. The STM revealed how the COVID-19 misinformation on the platforms was mainly concentrated around two discourses: politics and health. A qualitative critical discourse analysis was used to explore how vaccine-related misinformation reinforced or challenged broader power dynamics and hegemonic ideologies around health, science, and freedom. Informed by the quantitative analysis, the discourse analysis focused on two prevalent misinformation topics, revealing how vaccine-critical discourses contest the authority of health institutions and the government by framing vaccines as dangerous, experimental, and illegal. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of how misinformation circulates and evolves in specific sociopolitical contexts. By analyzing the intersections of ideology, power, and discourse, the study highlights social media’s role in mediating public debates during health crises. The results emphasize that misinformation is not merely false or misleading information but a strategic challenge to hegemony, ideology, and power. Implications include the need for more nuanced approaches to combating misinformation, addressing its ideological and discursive appeal.",

          "abstract": "Local short video platforms in India such as Moj and Josh have encountered mixed success in wooing talented creators and new users to their platforms. Some of the challenges they have faced suggest the limits of aspirational politics which is entangled with aspects of authenticity and relatability as well as the political economy of start-up apps and platform capitalisms. I endeavor to understand TikTok’s success in India and also comprehend in what ways Indian short video platforms tried to replicate TikTok’s algorithmic logics and creator/talent acquisition strategies within the cultural context of vernacular creativity in India. The article connects discussions of the popularity of short video platforms with recruitment strategies to tap influential content creators in provincial India. The article contends that while theorizing aspirational politics, it is not enough to study (in isolation) how creators aspire to be more successful and gain more followers and influence. Aspirations are also actively fashioned and nurtured by the platform’s talent scouts, content directors, and studio heads. The Indian government along with corporations also creates aspirational discourses. I conceptualize aspirational politics and entrepreneurial limits in these slippages and ruptures across individual desires and state-corporate-platform discourses of aspiration and entrepreneurship.",

          "authors": "Burçin Sarı",
          "abstract": "Professions are neither isolated nor static entities; they operate within a dynamic system that is shaped by the internal and external forces. Today, a novel yet formidable external force is gradually permeating professional domains: influencer creep , driven by neoliberal self-branding rhetoric. This study investigates the diffusion of influencer creep into psychology, a field with strong legal, workplace, and public jurisdiction. Using a multi-method approach, we observed 100 Turkish psychologists’ Instagram practices over 6 months and conducted 20 semi-structured interviews. Findings reveal that Instagram has become an unexpected intermediary in the labor market for psychologists, intensifying to fulfill the three pillars of influencer creep: self-branding, optimization, and authenticity. Psychologists now strategically use the platform as a “visual curriculum vitae,” leveraging its affordances to craft micro-selling points for their self-brand. These efforts also involve negotiating with algorithms, constant optimization efforts, and projecting themselves authentically by trying not to compromise their professional demeanor. Based on these findings, we contend that influencer creep not only alters individual professional practices but also reconfigures the profession itself through four interrelated changes: (a) the expansion of audiences, shifting from small-scale, localized clients to large, mass followings; (b) the redefinition of traditional markers of expertise, where institutional credentials are increasingly replaced by platform-driven metrics; (c) the alteration of traditional gatekeeping structures, as algorithmic systems take on a more prominent role in determining professional recognition and influence; and (d) requiring a new set of skills such as content creation and algorithmic proficiency, often overshadowing conventional professional competencies.",

          "authors": "Ruohan Li, Crystal Abidin",
          "abstract": "The wanghong economy in China adopts unique platform monetization strategies, including social tipping, virtual gifting, advertising, and more prominently, e-commerce. E-commerce wanghong are one type of influencer focusing on pushing sales through e-commerce services and play a pivotal role in integrating e-commerce and social media. Online shopping festivals have recently catalyzed the intersection of wanghong cultures and e-commerce. A typical example is the e-commerce giant Alibaba, which implemented multi-stage promotional activities during online shopping festivals to provide practitioners with expanded business opportunities. Notably, this flourishing integration of e-commerce and wanghong culture is carefully guided by the Chinese government’s unique political agenda and regulatory framework. To study this dynamic interplay between e-commerce wanghong, platforms, and national policies, we explore how e-commerce wanghong become a kind of “platformed wanghong.” Furthermore, we examine how e-commerce platforms change users’ experiences of time during online shopping festivals, which we refer to as “promotional temporalities.” Finally, we investigate the “nesting strategies” employed by e-commerce wanghong during these events, which are intertwined with the platform’s promotional temporalities and must navigate compliance within the national regulatory framework. Our findings shed light on the complex relationship between e-commerce wanghong, platform strategies, state regulation, and audience engagement in the context of platform economy.",

          "abstract": "With artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly shaping newsroom practices, scholars debate how citizens perceive news attributed to algorithms versus human journalists. Yet, little is known about these preferences in today’s polarized media environment, where partisan news consumption has surged. The current study explores this issue by providing a comprehensive and systematic examination of how citizens evaluate AI-attributed news compared to human-based news from like-minded and cross-cutting partisan sources. Using a preregistered conjoint experiment in the United States ( N = 2,011) that mimics a high-choice media environment, we find that citizens evaluate AI-attributed news as negatively as cross-cutting news sources, both in terms of attitudes (perceived trustworthiness) and behavior (willingness to read the news story), while strongly preferring like-minded sources. These patterns remain stable across polarizing and non-polarizing issues and persist regardless of citizens’ preexisting attitudes toward AI, political extremity, and media trust. Our findings thus challenge more optimistic views about AI’s potential to facilitate exposure to diverse viewpoints. Moreover, they suggest that increased automation of news production faces both public mistrust and substantial reader resistance, raising concerns about the future viability of AI in journalism.",

          "abstract": "This article explores the interplay between negativity in news coverage and interpersonal communication in shaping individuals’ beliefs, using the case of the COVID-19 pandemic. While existing research has examined the direct effects of these factors on beliefs, two overlooked key aspects are addressed in this article. First, I investigate how interpersonal communication interacts with the impact of negativity in news on shaping beliefs. Second, building upon media system dependency theory, I accounted for the temporal dynamics of media effects since the pandemic evolved and progressed in phases with shifting societal contexts. By relying on a linkage approach consisting of a five-wave panel survey and a quantitative media content analysis conducted in Sweden, the findings indicate that interpersonal communication serves as an amplifying moderator for exposure to negativity in forming beliefs about the negative societal impact of COVID-19. Furthermore, I find evidence supporting the temporally varying nature of media effects, with the influence of negativity decreasing as the crisis dragged on.",

Using a social semiotic approach, the authors analyse the websites of two primary schools in Singapore and examine how the semantic features of implications and presuppositions on the websites propagate the ideology of a transactional relationship between parents and schools. The social semiotic analysis reveals that parents were positioned as consumers through the multimodal choices on the web pages, with the ultimate message that the way to partner the school in education was to volunteer physically at the school. The authors discuss the implications of such an ideology and propose recommendations towards enabling parents to be partners in education.",
