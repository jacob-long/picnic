          "authors": "Ayoung Suh",
          "abstract": "Purpose In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the interest in the use of virtual reality (VR) for organizational collaboration has dramatically increased. However, empirical research on the optimal types of VR and avatar designs for effective collaboration remains limited. To address these gaps, this study investigates how VR types (immersive vs non-immersive) and avatar similarity (high vs low) impact collaboration performance, with a focus on the mediating roles of somatic, psychological and behavioral engagement. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on embodied cognition theory and grounded in user engagement theory, we developed a research model that delineates the factors influencing collaboration performance. This model was empirically tested with data collected from a laboratory experiment involving 195 participants, employing a 2 × 2 factorial design. The Engage VR was used for the experiment because it supports the same virtual environment for collaboration between immersive and non-immersive VR contexts. The data were analyzed at the team level ( n  = 65). Findings The results of this study reveal that both immersive VR and high avatar similarity significantly enhance collaboration performance by augmenting somatic engagement, which subsequently boosts psychological and behavioral engagement. Originality/value This research deepens the scholarly understanding of the intricate interplay among VR types, avatar design and user engagement. The study’s theoretical implications underscore the conceptualization of somatic engagement as a critical dimension of user engagement in virtual collaboration, enriching the extant literature on VR-based collaboration. It also provides pragmatic insights to enhance virtual collaboration in the workplace.",

          "abstract": "Purpose There are increasing expectations for educators to include sustainability as part of higher education Information and Communication Technology (ICT) curricula, but we still lack concrete ways how to integrate it into teaching. To be able to create meaningful learning experiences we need to understand how our students approach sustainability and what they base their thinking on. Design/methodology/approach We asked our students to consider technology development linked with the European Green Deal targets in their essays and utilized nexus analysis to focus on discourses in place, interaction order and the historical body revealed in the essays. Findings Learning about sustainability could be approached in the ICT courses in a structured way as a question of four intersecting elements: individuals, societal systems, current and emerging technologies, and relevancy of the topic, all of these linked with the agency of ICT professionals. Originality/value This study contributes toward sustainable ICT research and design of effective ICT education (1) by providing an understanding of how future ICT professionals approach sustainability and digital technology development, (2) by proposing a way to raise students’ consciousness of their own role as future professionals in developing more sustainable digital solutions and (3) generally helping students to see the big picture of sustainability through setting the scene with the wider targets.",

          "authors": "Tom Brock, Garry Crawford",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to examine the cultural and economic circumstances that shape esports consumer agency through case studies of “experiential consumption” (Miles, 2021). Design/methodology/approach A multiple-case study approach (Stake, 2006) is deployed alongside participant observation and document analysis to identify three cases of experiential consumption in esports – an esports tournament, a large online community for gaming peripherals and accessories, and an esportswear fashion brand. Findings The research identifies three aspects of experiential consumption relevant to esports. First, tournaments are sensory and emotional “spectacles”, immersing consumers in memorable experiences. Second, online gaming communities enable consumers to express themselves through “self-work”. Third, esportswear companies engage consumers with exclusive, authentic fashion experiences via “lifestyle branding”. Research limitations/implications The case studies highlight the need for future cross-cultural research on esports experiences, particularly how regional differences shape consumer behaviour. The impact of emerging technologies like virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), blockchain and AI on personalising experiences, enhancing interactivity and related ethical considerations should be further explored. Practical implications Esports stakeholders can enhance esports events with real-time data analytics, VR and AR to create immersive experiences. They can also diversify income streams via personalised and exclusive apparel lines that reflect consumer identity, collaborating with mainstream fashion or entertainment brands. Compelling, emotionally resonant storytelling can deepen fan engagement and help build brand loyalty. Originality/value This article presents a new theoretical understanding of esports consumption through multiple case studies of experiential consumption, revealing the central role that “experience” plays in shaping the design and choice of esports products and services.",

          "authors": "Lin Xiao, Xiaofeng Li, Jian Mou",
          "abstract": "Purpose Short-form video advertisements have recently gained popularity and are widely used. However, creating attractive short video advertisements remains a challenge for sellers. Based on the visual-audio perspective and signaling theory, this study investigated the impacts of three visual features (number of shots, pixel-level image complexity and vertical versus horizontal formats) and two audio features (speech rate and average spectral centroid) on user engagement behavior. Design/methodology/approach We conducted a field study on TikTok. To test our various hypotheses, we used regression analysis on 2,511 videos containing product promotion information posted by 60 sellers between January 1, 2020 and November 20, 2021. Findings For visual variables, the number of shots and pixel-level image complexity were found to have nonlinear (inverted U-shaped) relationships with user engagement behavior. The vertical video form was found to have a positive effect on comments and shares. In the case of audio variables, speech rate was found to have a significant positive effect on shares but not on likes and comments. The average spectral centroid was found to have significant negative influences on likes and comments. Practical implications This study provides specific suggestions for sellers who create short-form videos to improve user engagement behavior. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature on short-form video advertising by extending the potential drivers of user engagement behavior. Additionally, from a methodological perspective, it contributes to the literature by using computer vision and speech-processing techniques to analyze user behavior in a video-related context, effectively overcoming the limitations of the widely adopted survey method.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Online patient reviews are of considerable importance on online health platforms. However, there is limited understanding of how these reviews are generated and their impact on patients' choices of physicians. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the antecedents and consequences of online patient reviews on online health platforms. Design/methodology/approach This study introduced an online interaction model with multiple stages aimed at examining how physicians' service quality affects patients' review behavior and, consequently, influences patients' choices of physicians. Findings The results revealed that technical quality and emotional care significantly influenced the effort that patients exert and their use of positive emotional words when writing reviews, which, in turn, positively influenced patients' selection of physicians. Moreover, it was found that the voice channel had a significant moderating effect on the relationship between physician service quality and patient review behavior. Practical implications The study’s findings can help online health platform managers improve the platform system by optimizing the integrated text and voice interaction functions. The findings can also support physicians in improving service quality, managing online reviews and attracting patients’ choices. Originality/value This study enriches the literature on physician service quality, patient online reviews and choices in online health platforms. Furthermore, this study offers a novel perspective on the social exchange process in online healthcare settings by highlighting the role of media in shaping physician–patient interactions.",

          "authors": "Jasmina Berbegal-Mirabent, Inés Alegre, Dolors Gil-Doménech",
          "abstract": "Purpose Multiple crowdfunding platforms have been created over the last decade. Some have become extremely successful, but many others have failed. This study focuses on those strategic choices that founders of crowdfunding platforms need to make early on and which determine the basic characteristics of a platform. Specifically, it examines which combination(s) of these initial strategic choices shape(s) the survival of a platform. Design/methodology/approach Qualitative comparative analysis is used to analyze the design configurations that are especially relevant for the long-term survival of crowdfunding platforms. Several robustness checks are performed. The empirical setting consists of a unique dataset of all crowdfunding platforms created in Spain over a period of ten years. Findings Ten configurations are obtained (four in the case of reward and donation platforms, and six for equity and lending), suggesting different paths to platform survival. Although equity and lending platforms tend to be more likely to survive than donation and reward platforms, the type of platform is not definitive. Another interesting observation is that when platforms fail, they do so quite fast. Practical implications We acknowledge that strategic choices are a combination of different elements; therefore, our approach offers a holistic view that mirrors the heterogeneity of resources and capabilities of entrepreneurs. Our study derives a different set of recommendations for lending and equity platforms than for reward and donation platforms, underlining the importance of designing and treating each type of platform in a particular way. Originality/value Most crowdfunding literature has the individual crowdfunding project as the main level of analysis. Research to date has focused on the characteristics that projects must possess to succeed. The present study explores differences at the platform level. Our research brings new evidence on some of the decisions entrepreneurs need to confront when starting a crowdfunding platform and provides useful recommendations that might help them increase the chances of survival for their platform.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: The affordances of online channels can influence communication, and communicators sometimes value affordances differently in different relationships. This study examines how two affordances, anonymity and visibility, combine with relationship closeness to shape how people seek support online. Participants ( N = 171) composed a support-seeking message they imagined sending to various audiences in one of several online channels. Participants and outside observers rated the breadth, depth, and emotional content of the messages. The results suggest relationship closeness was negatively associated with perceived anonymity and perceived visibility. Greater anonymity corresponded with higher observed depth in support-seeking messages and greater visibility corresponded with higher self-reported emotional content. Furthermore, each affordance was positively associated with the observed emotional content of messages at low levels of closeness, and anonymity shared a negative association with the self-reported depth of messages only when visibility was low and closeness was high. Findings suggest that the content of support-seeking messages hinges, in part, on affordances and relationship characteristics.",

          "abstract": "Close sibling relationships can serve as a salient source of support, particularly for individuals navigating stressors associated with emerging adulthood and minoritized identities. Using attachment theory and the temporal intersectional minority stress model as guiding frameworks, mixed-methods data were collected from 939 emerging adult college students to examine the role that siblings play in sexually diverse individual well-being. Sexually diverse emerging adults who perceived close sibling ties did not exhibit a negative effect of prospective anxiety on their self-esteem, but did experience an elevation in positive affect in the face of prospective anxiety, whereas sexually diverse individuals who had poor sibling relationships and heterosexual emerging adults did not show these protective effects. Interactions were not significant for negative affect. Sexually diverse emerging adults shared their lived experiences of how their siblings contribute to their well-being, including themes of affect, sibling interactions, sibling qualities, and coping within the relationship. Most sexually diverse individuals appeared to view a positive effect of siblings on their well-being despite less proximity to the family of origin.",

          "authors": "Mara Morelli, Fau Rosati, Antonio Chirumbolo, Roberto Baiocco, Maria Rosaria Nappa, Elena Cattelino",
          "abstract": "Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) is characterized by an intense desire to continually stay connected with others and is strictly linked to motivational factors implicated in social interactions, particularly through online communication. FoMO represents a risk factor for problematic use of communication through social media platforms. Only a few studies have explored the relationship between FoMO and sexting. This study is the first to investigate the relationship between FoMO and three motivations for sexting (i.e., sexual purpose, body image reinforcement, and instrumental/aggravated reasons), while also examining the moderating effects of age, gender, and sexual orientation. The study involved 911 Italian heterosexual and LGB+ young adults aged 18–30 years ( M = 22.3; SD = 2.57; 74% women; 70.4% heterosexual). The findings reveal that FoMO predicts sexting across all its motivational components. No significant differences emerged between men and women in their levels of engagement in sexting for sexual purposes. However, women were more likely to engage in sexting for body image reinforcement compared to men. Conversely, men demonstrated a higher likelihood of sexting for instrumental/aggravated reasons than women. LGB+ people, compared to heterosexuals, demonstrated a higher propensity for engaging in sexting for sexual purposes, body image reinforcement, and instrumental/aggravated reasons. FoMO emerged as a strong predictor of sexting for body image reinforcement and instrumental/aggravated reasons, especially for LGB+ people. This study identifies FoMO as a predictor of sexting motivations, particularly among women and LGB+ individuals, who may seek validation or connection online. Preventive interventions are needed to foster autonomy, enhance body self-esteem, and promote mutual respect in online interactions, especially for people embodying marginalized identities.",

          "abstract": "Prior studies on coparenting have primarily focused on mothers and fathers, neglecting coparenting dynamics in multi-generational families. This study aimed to investigate coparenting perceptions among mothers, fathers and grandparents, and explore the associations between the coparenting relationship and adolescent problem behavior, as well as demographic characteristics. The sample included 1163 families with children aged 10–13 years. Mothers ( n = 997) and fathers ( n = 863) provided ratings of their coparenting relationship toward their partners and one grandparent, while grandparents ( n = 249) reported on the coparenting relationship with mothers. Results showed that compared to mothers, fathers reported more undermining of their own parenting by their partner. They were more supportive of their partner’s parenting and more positive about the division of labor. Fathers rated the overall coparenting relationship more positively than mothers, as indicated by the General Coparenting Scale. Notably, grandparents reported significantly more positive coparenting relations with mothers than mothers’ reports of coparenting with grandparents, expressing affirmation of parental competency and alignment with parenting practices. More positive coparenting was associated with less problem behaviors, which was true for coparenting across parents and grandparents. Furthermore, older adolescent age and higher socioeconomic status were significantly correlated with increased coparenting agreement and closeness. Maternal and paternal grandmothers did not differ in their ratings of the coparenting relationship with the child’s mother. These findings underscore the significance of recognizing differential perceptions among family members regarding coparenting behaviors, providing valuable insights for tailoring specific recommendations to enhance coparenting quality within diverse families.",

          "authors": "Katie Read, Dilan Kılıç, Rotem Kahalon, Verena Klein",
          "abstract": "Objectification theory posits that women are treated merely as a body, valued for its use, pleasure and consumption by and for others, mainly men. Women are also disadvantaged relative to men when it comes to sexually pleasurable experiences, including lower orgasm rates and a higher burden of performing sexual emotional labour (e.g., faking orgasm, performing desire for the partner, tolerating discomfort or pain during sex). We tested the hypothesis that objectification within romantic relationships (i.e., partner-objectification) may contribute to this tendency. Using data from 160 heterosexual couples, we aimed to explore how women’s self-objectification, perceived partner-objectification, and men’s self-reported partner-objectification are related to women’s orgasm rates and performance of sexual emotional labour. Self-objectification predicted women’s performance of sexual emotional labour but did not predict women’s orgasm rates. Our results further indicate that to the extent that women perceived themselves as being objectified by their male partner, they tend to report lower orgasm rates and greater performance of emotional labour. However, men’s self-reported partner-objectification did not. These findings suggest that women’s meta-perceptions are of greater importance for women’s sexual well-being than men’s self-reports. The research has implications for societal interventions aimed at preventing the consequences of partner-objectification, as well as for discussions in sex and relationship therapy for couples.",

          "authors": "Bingbing Zhang, Heather Shoenberger",
          "abstract": "While recent research has demonstrated how exposure to cross-cutting political opinions intensifies politically motivated disconnectivity on social media, there has been a notable gap in examining the influence of emotions and psychological traits in this process. Guided by the theories of selective avoidance and affective intelligence, our study employed a survey through Qualtrics panel drawn from a population-matching sample (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 498) of the US population to investigate how perceived political disagreement on social media affects decisions to unfollow and unfriend others through the induction of affective responses (e.g., anger, anxiety) and the role of psychological trait—need to belong. Controlling for demographics and political ideology, our mediation analysis revealed that perceived political disagreement was significantly related to anger, which was further positively associated with both unfollowing and unfriending on social media. Perceived political disagreement was also related to anxiety while anxiety was positively associated with individuals’ behaviors of unfollowing and unfriending. Furthermore, results showed that the need to belong played a significant role in moderating the relationship between perceived political disagreement and unfriending. When perceiving the same level of political disagreement, individuals with a higher need to belong were less likely to unfriend others on social media, compared to those with a lower need to belong. However, the need to belong did not exert a significant impact on how perceived political disagreement influenced unfollowing behavior. This study contributes to understanding the nuanced dynamics of disconnectivity on social media, particularly in navigating political disagreements.",

          "authors": "Ferre Wouters, Michaël Opgenhaffen",
          "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;After a significant surge of active fact-checking organisations in the past decade, more than 100 countries are being covered by fact-checkers today. Although the fact-checking movement is diverse, most operate on a national level. However, there are also organisations that operate on a sub-state level. Based either by community or geographic region, these fact-checkers investigate statements that are relevant for a specific population, and might otherwise remain unaddressed. In Europe, signatories of the International Fact-Checking Network are active in regions with federal or devolved power. This study brings a comparative analysis of regional fact-checkers in Europe, drawing on a combination of qualitative interviews with the organisations’ editors and managers, and a complementary document analysis. Our findings highlight the difference of organisational formats on fact-checking motivations, the difference in scope between political fact-checking and debunking routines, and the collaborative relations of regional fact-checkers with national and international organisations. This article adds to the debate of the global fact-checking movement by raising awareness of regional and local fact-checking, to overcome so-called fact deserts.&lt;/p&gt;",

          "abstract": "&lt;span&gt;This thematic issue explores the global fact-checking field, focusing on its organizations, practices, and institutional dynamics. Over the past decade, fact-checking has expanded to over 400 organizations, with approximately half operating in the Global South. Fact-checkers have built a solid institutional framework featuring annual conferences, regulatory bodies, and partnerships with big techs and public organizations. Even with this cohesion, the fact-checking movement remains deeply heterogeneous. Organizations range from small local outlets to global media giants, operating within varied media and political systems. These differences shape how fact-checkers define their mission and approach misinformation, and offer a valuable lens for journalism and political communication studies to analyze evolving media systems and digitalization effects worldwide. Given such diversity, our issue addresses the need for research to observe regional and comparative perspectives on fact-checking alongside studies of broader global trends. Recent scholarship has focused on how fact-checkers adapt to diverse environments, particularly in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and how the field is evolving. It also examines fact-checkers' relationships with platform companies, policymakers, and transnational institutions combating misinformation. Contributions employing diverse methodologies, from case studies to large-scale content analyses, are included, with a particular emphasis on understanding organizational and contextual specificities in this crucial area of media and political communication.&lt;/span&gt;",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the emerging trend of “dad vlogs” and short videos on Xiaohongshu, a popular lifestyle platform in China that incorporates e-commerce. Specifically, it examines how dad vloggers represent fathers’ parenting practices and responsibilities in their videos, and how they construct the commercial aspects of their content. Through a netnography approach and the analysis of 285 popular dad vlogs and short videos created by ten father influencers on Xiaohongshu, the study reveals how these dad vloggers showcase the various activities and efforts involved in raising children. They take on the roles of friend, playmate, and mentor, incorporating a type of humour and playfulness that end up characterising their approach. Notably, a hybrid model of fatherhood has emerged that combines new practices—such as encouragement and an “emotionally strategic” approach—with the traditional Chinese father’s role as an educator, aiming to cultivate high-achieving children. Based on such representations, the commercialisation of father influencers’ content involves different approaches to integrating product endorsements into well-crafted, informative videos with a well-received persona. The findings provide insights into contemporary parenting practices popularised in short videos, where representations of fatherhood attract large audiences, particularly female viewers, while enabling monetisation in the context of Chinese platform economies.",

          "authors": "Manisha Madapathi",
          "abstract": "Using internet shutdowns as a reaction to civil unrest has become a common response from the Indian state. In 2022, India remains at the top with the highest number of recorded shutdowns in the world, for the fifth consecutive year. Several state and central governments have used this tactic to suspend the flow of information, either to curtail the ability of citizens to organise through social media networks, dominate discourse around an event, or both. Many such instances have increased the circulation of misinformation, leading to polarised online spaces created partly due to the lack of internet connectivity. Digital disconnection then becomes a condition forced upon its citizens rather than a voluntary choice made by individuals. To explore the impact of internet shutdowns on civic discourse, I look at the case of the farmers’ protest in India, that lasted from September 2020 to November 2021. The movement successfully led to the repeal of the three controversial farm laws. The protest faced challenges due to internet shutdowns along with other forms of crackdown by authorities. I use in-depth interviews to bring in the voices of the various stakeholders who participated in this movement. In this article, I would like to place the farmers’ protest as a vantage point from where one can look at how the Indian state has used internet shutdowns to control dissent.",

It comprises empirical research with 35 news professionals, including 35 semi-structured interviews and 33 diary materials. Data were qualitatively analyzed using the thematic networks approach. Findings reveal that digital platforms have influenced the work–life balance of journalists in conflicting ways, encompassing positive, mixed, and negative effects. In this sense, news workers have employed various practices to limit their use of digital media and promote work–life balance. Overall, this study presents a more comprehensive description of the impact of digital platforms in journalism. It also highlights these technologies’ prominence to positive or negative spillovers between personal and professional spheres. Last, it introduces a cognitive map of the actions put in place by a professional group to keep their digital media use under some control, which may also be seen as practices of journalistic disconnection.",

We used a three-wave survey conducted from 2021 to 2023 involving 1226 Finnish adults and applied random effects within-between models for data analysis. The results show positive within- and between-person effects of a preference for interacting with artificially intelligent systems (over humans) and the use of smart technology on digital relatedness as well as positive between-person effects of a sense of local community belonging. The positive effect of using smart technology was particularly evident for individuals with a lower or medium level of local community belonging. The results suggest that frequent technology use can enhance digital relatedness, especially for those less connected to their local community.",

          "abstract": "Recent studies have explored how the purveyors of problematic information can mobilize online crowds by tapping into positive feelings like amusement, belonging, and optimism. Unfortunately, it is not clear how such participation and emotions can also help communities reduce the spread of problematic information. We address this gap by examining how a group of Japanese social media “watchers” monitored and countered YamatoQ, a pro-QAnon Japanese conspiracy group. We analyze interviews with 12 watchers to make empirical contributions about the how, where, and why of their activities. Participants describe a playful approach to confronting problematic information, whereby they leverage a sense of improvisation, humor, and community to meet the challenges of their work. These results extend our knowledge of volunteer efforts to address problematic information, and expand the range of perspectives represented in the literature regarding the participatory and emotional aspects of problematic information.",

Using an extended Bourdieusian framework, this article critically reassesses vloggers’ digital creative labour, conditions and decisions by conceptualising them as various outcomes of position-taking in the emerging field of digital cultural production, tied to socioeconomic differences. Based on interviews with YouTubers in Hong Kong, this study examines how class background shapes young vloggers’ career paths and future aspirations. The findings reveal their divergent class-inflected orientations towards the common tensions between (1) platform productivity and creative autonomy, (2) elite evaluation and mass rating and (3) career planning and an uncertain vlogging future. Shifting the focus to the nexus between class inequality and the platform creative economy, this article provides a nuanced account of digital creative work amid platform precarity and uncertainty.",

This study examined the heterogeneity of Chinese youth's cognitive emotion regulation (CER) strategies and conflict resolution responses, as well as their collective influence on individuals' perceived partner responsiveness (PPR) and relationship satisfaction. We recruited 300 Chinese youth who were currently involved in romantic relationships to complete self‐reported measures of CER (reappraisal and suppression), conflict resolution responses in romantic relationships (exit, voice, neglect, and loyalty), PPR, and relationship satisfaction. We used latent profile analysis (LPA) to classify the combined effects of CER and conflict resolution responses, identifying four profiles: releasing, gentle, proactive, and inhibiting. Proactive communicators have significantly higher levels of relationship satisfaction compared to the other three groups and significantly higher levels of PPR compared to individuals in releasing and inhibiting profiles. Individuals in releasing and gentle profiles have significantly higher relationship satisfaction and PPR than individuals in the inhibiting profile. This study uncovered the possible associations between Chinese young adults' emotion regulation and conflict response profiles and romantic relationship process and outcome by adopting the person‐centered approach. We further discussed the practical implications of the findings.",

          "abstract": "Depressive symptoms can spillover between romantic partners. From an attachment lens, depressive symptoms passing from one partner to another may be more frequent in the context of anxious attachment. Using 1179 German couples who remained together across 4 years (five waves) from the Panel Analysis on Intimate Relationships and Family Dynamics, analyses tested the extent anxious attachment moderated the initial level of depressive symptom spillover between partners' depressive symptom trajectories. Results revealed that men's and women's higher initial depressive symptoms were not significantly associated with changes in their partners' depressive symptom trajectories. However, the current study found that women's anxious attachment was associated with the link between men's initial depressive symptoms and the trajectory of women's depressive symptoms. Specifically, women who were more anxiously attached had a small, but greater risk of experiencing increased depressive symptom spillover across a four‐year period when their male partners had higher initial depressive symptoms. Together, this suggests depressive symptom spillover did occur among a general population of German couples, but primarily in the context of more anxiously attached women. Future research should examine the role attachment plays in the depressive symptom spillover among couples.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the rising trend of loneliness and depression among adolescents in the context of Chinese culture, investigating the relationship between different patterns of disclosure and secrecy and adolescent anxiety and loneliness. A person‐centered approach was used to explore disclosure and secrecy in relationships of 253 adolescents ( M = 15.52, range = 14–18, 54.4% female) from Nanjing's public schools and the impact of these patterns on their levels of depression and loneliness. The results indicate that adolescent disclosure and secrecy toward parents and good friends are correlated with adolescent depression and loneliness. Five groups can be identified based on disclosure and secrecy, with each group demonstrating significant differences in the degree of disclosure and secrecy and distinct characteristics. Significant differences exist in the levels of adolescent depression and loneliness among the different groups. This study emphasizes the value of a person‐centered approach. Findings suggest that having multiple avenues for dialogue is more beneficial than merely increasing the volume of disclosure within any single channel. This emphasizes the importance of a diversified support network in enhancing adolescent well‐being. The research also recognizes that small samples can uncover more complex or diversified groups that exhibit unique behavioral patterns within specific cultures.",

Analyzing 1,561 valid questionnaires collected from February to July 2023, the results demonstrate that trust and procedural legitimacy positively influence public acceptance of FRT. Trust also mediates the effects of perceived privacy and functional risks on FRT acceptance. Privacy and social risks deter public acceptance, while functional risks surprisingly show positive effects. The study identifies a descending order of negative impact among these risk categories. In addition, the convenience, location and purpose of FRT use, and the severity of crimes it targets significantly delineate public acceptance boundaries, reflecting a consequentialist approach to technology ethics that prioritizes utility and outcomes.",

          "authors": "Shoaib Ul Haq, Ray Yiu-keung Kwok",
          "abstract": "This study examines how social media platforms shape encounters with religious “others” across diverse cultural contexts, focusing on Muslim users in Pakistan and Buddhist/Christian users in Hong Kong. Through qualitative interviews and reflexive thematic analysis, we identify key patterns in how these platforms both facilitate and constrain meaningful interreligious dialogue. We find that while religious social media can expand exposure to diverse perspectives, it often reinforces in-group boundaries and amplifies polarization through echo chamber effects. Our findings further reveal that users engage in selective exposure, primarily interacting with like-minded believers, while also developing new competencies as “religious bridge-builders” in some cases who cultivate new competencies for interreligious communication. We develop a theoretical framework of “digital othering” to explain how believers navigate religious identity, knowledge, and community in online spaces. By adopting a cross-cultural comparative approach, the study contributes to our understanding of religion in the digital age, offering insights into the culturally specific manifestations of digital othering while also identifying broader patterns that transcend particular contexts. This research advances the field of digital religion studies, providing a nuanced understanding of how social media reshapes religious expression, authority, and interreligious relations in an increasingly digitized global society.",

          "authors": "Frederic Gerdon",
          "abstract": "With technological advances, governments and companies gain opportunities to collect data to provide public benefits. However, such data collections and uses need to fulfill ethical standards and comply with citizens’ privacy preferences, which may vary across several dimensions. The Comparative Privacy Research Framework suggests specific comparative dimensions that may shape such privacy-related perceptions. I propose how to integrate into this framework a specific meso-level perspective for concisely operationalizing data uses context-specifically: the privacy theory of contextual integrity, developed by Helen Nissenbaum. This article presents an empirical application of this approach by investigating specific data use scenarios across countries, while simultaneously considering temporal, international, and individual-level variation. To this end, an online survey experiment was conducted in three countries (Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom) in December 2022 and May 2023. In this experiment, respondents rated the appropriateness of fictitious data use scenarios. The scenarios varied by data type, data recipients, and conditions of data use. The results show that the effects of contextual parameters vary across countries to different degrees. Respondents react particularly sensitively to changes in data types, with health data being overall most accepted to be used. The relative acceptance of the data recipients clearly varies across countries. Country-level individualism is not consistently related to the desired level of control over data. These findings highlight the usefulness of contextual integrity to unmask meso-level, context-specific variations in privacy attitudes across countries. A meso-level perspective that operationalizes data uses according to contextual integrity can therefore inform comparative privacy research and privacy-related policymaking.",

          "authors": "Liming Liu, Yiming Chen",
          "abstract": "China enacted its first Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) on 1 November 2021. However, there is a dearth of systematic research examining the implementation of new privacy policies exercised by digital platforms and user engagement with these policies. This study establishes a triple-layered comparative approach to explore the complexities and particularities of privacy policy practices in Chinese digital platforms. The methodology encompasses the analysis of privacy policies from representative platforms—WeChat, Taobao, and Douyin—alongside user experience garnered through a walkthrough method and insights from 28 interviews with platform users. Through critical discourse analysis, the research revealed that state-dominant policy discourses were ingrained in the formulation of platform privacy regulations to legitimize their authority over user data ownership. The users perceived a strong sense of passive protection, characterized by the rigid “agreement” discourse practices that underscore their vulnerability in everyday digital platform usage. The findings shed light on intricate power dynamics at play between platforms, their privacy policies, and users, which leads to polarized reactions from users toward privacy concerns. By examining the articulation of digital privacy policies as instruments of statecraft, we offer a nuanced view of describing non-Western experiences of privacy values and regulatory practices in the digital age.",

Racialized sexual harassment was rampant, with girls of color being inundated with requests for nudes and sexual comments, especially on Facebook. Participants said that they faced harassment on Instagram irrespective of race, which, as prior studies have shown, has a distinct bias against users of color. Harassment toward girls of color promoted harmful racial stereotypes. American Indians were also deeply impacted. Unrelenting online harassment made participants feel uncomfortable and uneasy (45%), racially discriminated against (40%), and hated (12%) on platforms they chose to socialize and seek information of interest on.",

          "abstract": "Social media platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat offer adolescents many opportunities to control how other users see and perceive them. By observing their peers’ self-presentations and receiving feedback on their own self-presentations from them, adolescents learn what is typical (descriptive norms) and appropriate (injunctive norms) on different social media platforms. Based on computer-assisted face-to-face surveys with German Instagram and/or Snapchat users aged between 14 and 16 years ( N = 1,002), we examined the impact of descriptive and injunctive norms on adolescents’ self-presentation practices on social media. Drawing on the theory of normative social behavior and the affordances approach, we also considered the norm-moderating factors of outcome expectations, group identity, platform differences, and perceived content persistence. We provide evidence that both descriptive and injunctive peer norms influence adolescents’ staged self-presentations, authentic self-presentations, and presentations of everyday life, although none of the moderating factors reached practical significance.",

          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by an unprecedented influx of misinformation often with adverse impact on the effectiveness of institutional responses to the health crisis. However, relatively little is still known about the factors that may have facilitated the proliferation and public acceptance of misinformation related to the virus or to the government’s anti-pandemic measures, particularly in comparative perspective. Utilizing data collected by a representative cross-country survey ( N = 5,000) in four countries led by populist leaders during the pandemic—Brazil, Poland, Serbia, and the United States—this study explores the links between three mutually interrelated factors, namely media usage across different platforms, affinity to populism, and trust in scientific expertise, and people’s beliefs in selected COVID-related misinformation. The findings show that preexisting attitudes, especially affinity to populism and mistrust in experts, are generally stronger predictors of people’s likelihood to endorse misinformation related to the pandemic than their news consumption patterns. Nevertheless, the analysis also indicates an important role played by exposure to specific media brands, particularly those promoting a skeptical stance toward preventive measures and COVID-19 vaccines, as well as messaging apps, which display stronger relationship with misinformation beliefs than social networking sites. The article concludes by discussing implications for practical efforts to combat misinformation, especially during a health crisis.",

          "authors": "Miriam Kroman Brems",
          "abstract": "Many western democracies have witnessed an upsurge of partisan alternative media that explicitly challenge the legitimacy of mainstream media and politics alike and promote populist discourses. Accordingly, alternative media are often discussed in relation to lower levels of political trust and support for populist parties. Yet, only a limited number of studies have investigated these relationships empirically. Drawing on survey data representative of the Danish adult population ( n = 1,518) collected in January/February 2023, this study investigates how using alternative media is related to political trust, populist attitudes, and populist vote intentions. Unlike previous studies, it distinguishes between left-wing and right-wing alternative media users and finds notable differences: Users of right-wing alternative media have lower political trust, hold more populist attitudes, and have greater predicted probability of intending to vote for a right-wing populist party than non-users, but similar results were not found for users of left-wing alternative media. The study discusses potential explanations for this and how (different) alternative media might impact democracy.",
