          "abstract": "The association between playing digital games and watching esports has, to date, been an explicit assumption of many works, specifically that there is a strong and direct correlation between playing games and watching esports. The conflation of game play and esports serves to create conceptual confusion and a lack of clarity in research, both in HCI and beyond. This exploratory, atheoretical work demonstrates that some correlations exist between game play and spectating esports; however, many measures were not found to have statistically significant associations. Furthermore, the observed correlations were found to have small effect sizes and explained little variance of esports spectating measures. Results question fundamental assumptions of many works, which assume a strong association between playing games and spectating esports, raising concerns about their validity and applicability. Furthermore, they highlight the need for further research into the interactions of digital games and the systems which have emerged around them.",

Collected through participant observation and interviews with esports student-athletes, the fieldwork conducted during this research shines a light on the demands faced by the varsity student-athletes of St. Clair College. Furthermore, it investigates the role of student-athletes in developing new institutions within the varsity esports field. The findings offer an illustration of practice and competition for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Fortnite , among other titles. Utilizing a conceptual framework adopted from neo-institutionalism, the author discusses instances of institutional agency expressed by participants, whereby players successfully altered their program requirements. The article contributes to ongoing discussions about barriers faced by those in North American varsity esports programs by illuminating their everyday experiences. It concludes with recommendations for Canadian varsity esports institutions aiming for a more equitable future for players.",

          "authors": "Xianpei Hong, Liwei Pan, Min Xu, Qian Chen",
          "abstract": "Purpose The widespread use of recommendation algorithms offers convenience to users but may unintentionally create echo chambers. This study aims to investigate user behavior in response to echo chambers and the psychological mechanisms that drive these reactions. Design/methodology/approach Based on psychological reactance theory, we develop a four-stage model consisting of “external stimulus – threat perception – reactance – behavioral response” to investigate how echo chambers affect users’ psychology and behavior on social media. This study collects 493 valid questionnaires. Findings Findings suggest that echo chamber features – high information density and similarity – significantly motivate users’ psychological resistance, with perceived freedom threat and fatigue experiences mediating this process. In response to this resistance, users interrupt their behavior, limit self-disclosure and increase misrepresentative interactions. Originality/value This study systematically investigates the psychological and behavioral mechanisms behind users’ reactions to the echo chamber effect. It innovatively applies psychological reactance theory to social media echo chambers, enhancing the understanding of user psychology in the digital era. Additionally, the study broadens the previous emphasis on passive avoidance by identifying a range of coping strategies—both off-platform and in-platform—and emphasizes how users utilize algorithmic logic to modify information flows.

          "authors": "Marco Alexandre Terlizzi, Laura Brandimarte, Susan A. Brown, Otávio Próspero Sanchez",
          "abstract": "Purpose Despite their potential influence on user behavior in digital contexts, emotional factors, particularly fear, are underexplored in research on privacy concerns. To address this gap, our study investigates how fear affects privacy concerns, trust beliefs, risk beliefs and the intention to use mobile banking. The study is framed using the “antecedents → privacy concerns → outcomes” model, which synthesizes empirical findings from information systems research and is augmented by behavioral economics to account for overlooked but essential factors such as emotions. Design/methodology/approach Our research includes two different studies: (1) a laboratory experiment using both a direct (facial recognition) and self-reported measure of fear, followed by (2) an online experiment using self-reported fear scales. In both studies, we simulated an attack in which financial information is stolen. Findings The results demonstrate that trust in mobile banking decreases privacy concerns and has a more significant effect if the user is not afraid. Fear directly affects trust and privacy concerns but not risk beliefs or intention to use. Thus, when a mobile banking user is stimulated by a fear appeal message, the fear of losing information increases, activating privacy concerns and indirectly leading to increased mobile banking risk beliefs and reduced mobile banking usage. Originality/value Our study makes four main contributions. It demonstrates that (1) manipulating high and low fear appeal messages influences trusting beliefs and mobile banking information privacy concerns, so individuals with higher privacy concerns will be warier when using mobile banking. There exists an important boundary condition to the well-established relationship between trust and privacy concerns, such that when a mobile banking user is afraid of losing personal information, trust is not as effective in alleviating privacy concerns; (2) facial recognition can be used in privacy studies; (3) physiological responses to fear are significantly correlated with self-reported fear and (4) risk and intention to use are not directly driven by fear, so being afraid does not necessarily imply that users will stop using this technology.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This research integrates a knowledge-based view with socio-technical systems (STS) theory to examine how organizational big data predictive analytics (BDPA) influence employee innovative behavior through a multilevel theoretical framework. The study aims to theorize the cross-level impact of organizational BDPA adoption on individual innovative behavior and identify the underlying mechanisms through which team knowledge-sharing behavior and knowledge process capability mediate this relationship. Design/methodology/approach The research involves an empirical study that collected data from 48 firms, which included 100 teams and 561 company employees. The study uses a multi-level model to analyze the data and examine the relationships between organizational BDPA, company employees’ innovative behavior and the mediating effects of team knowledge-sharing behavior and knowledge process capability. Findings (a) There is a significant cross-level main effect, indicating that organizational BDPA has a noteworthy impact on company employees’ innovative behavior. (b) Knowledge sharing behavior and knowledge process capability serve as bridging mechanisms between BDPA and employee innovative behavior. Originality/value This study makes three key theoretical contributions: first, it advances STS theory by identifying dual knowledge-based mediating mechanisms that explain how organizational technological capabilities translate into individual innovative behavior. Second, it extends STS theory from horizontal to vertical socio-technical interactions through a validated multilevel framework spanning organizational, team and individual levels. Third, it demonstrates the contextual applicability of STS principles in China’s unique institutional environment, revealing amplified conditions for team-based knowledge processes in emerging economies.",

          "authors": "Shih-Ju Wang, Heng Chiang Huang",
          "abstract": "Purpose Generative AI (GenAI) harnesses combined knowledge of mankind, possibly holding users in awe as they conduct upward social comparison by exploiting GenAI’s “know-it-all” wisdom to improve self-capability and prevent falling behind in work performance. This study aims to depict the GenAI-led upward social comparison process and addresses its antecedents and consequences. Design/methodology/approach Drawing upon various theories relating to possible selves, self-affirmation, self-discrepancy and relative deprivation, this study proposes a dual-route conceptual model illustrating causal linkages from users’ self-exploration/self-affirmation to their upward social comparison, perceived GenAI divinity and after-usage experience. The authors delineate propositions and also identify moderating factors of the model. Findings We suggest that people’s need for self-exploration and self-affirmation triggers a yearning for upward social comparison, which activates their “sense of awe” and “God salience” toward GenAI. Besides self-enhancing benefits from continued use of GenAI, consumers as free-riders of collective wisdom may experience diffidence or even imposter anxiety. Originality/value This study investigates the underlying mechanism of the transformation and development of GenAI users’ self-concepts and mental states through the techno-socio-psychological lens. The mechanism can partly explain why GenAI’s dynamism contributes to its recent fervor. Our findings have profound marketing implications in the booming AI era.",

          "authors": "Keman Huang, Xiaoqing Wang, Jilei Zhou, Bin Liang",
          "abstract": "Purpose As the cybersecurity risks rapidly grow for older adults, fear appeal – a persuasive message that highlights potential cyber threats to motivate protective behavior – has become increasingly prevalent in efforts to protect them. While numerous researchers have examined responses to fear appeals, no prior studies have implemented an actual fear appeal specifically targeting older adults to investigate its effectiveness in influencing their cybersecurity behaviors. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on Protection Motivation Theory and the Elaboration Likelihood Model, we develop a framework that conceptualizes Family Risk Involvement (FRI) as a central cue, self-stigma perception as a peripheral cue, and cognitive age as a moderator. This framework explains how older adults process fear appeal messages to enhance their cybersecurity behaviors, including individual-level security policy compliance and collaborative security knowledge sharing. We operationalize the central and peripheral cues in the form of message designs integrated into elderly-oriented cybersecurity training materials. Using these materials, we conduct a large-scale study via an offline training program for 4,944 elderly participants from over 400 local communities across 14 provinces in China. Findings Partial least squares structural equation modeling analysis of data collected from 4,944 participants reveals that the fear appeal message design through FRI and self-stigma perception significantly improves older adults’ cybersecurity behaviors. These effects are moderated by cognitive age, which exerts a reinforcement interaction effect. Originality/value This study contributes to both the theoretical understanding and practical design of effective fear appeal messages to promote cybersecurity behaviors among older adults.",

          "authors": "Kofi Osei-Frimpong, Nazrul Islam, Caroline Korkor Ahorkonu, Lebene Richmond Soga, Graeme McLean",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study explores the dark side effects of continuous social media brand community (SMBC) participation on consumer psychological ill-being. Design/methodology/approach A two-wave online quantitative survey was conducted over a 12-month period, involving 805 consumers with prior experience participating in social media brand communities. The proposed model was analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) with AMOS 26.0. Findings The research indicates that individuals using social media for escapism are significantly linked to their SMBC participation and the experience of social media fatigue. Over time, participation in SMBC was found to greatly influence both social media fatigue and information overload. Notably, while negative emotions were closely tied to consumer psychological ill-being, information overload did not exhibit the same connection. Additionally, social media fatigue served as a mediator between SMBC participation and negative emotions. Similarly, negative emotions acted as a mediator between social media fatigue and psychological ill-being. Research limitations/implications This research examined the dark side of using social media as an escape and continuous participation in SMBC, employing a two-wave quantitative methodology. The study was confined to brand communities on the Facebook platform. This presents a limitation in terms of the broade applicability of the findings, as the analysis did not encompass a comprehensive range of social media platforms. Practical implications The study highlights the importance of managers maintaining order and promoting an environment of fairness on social media platforms to minimize negative emotions and reduce tensions among users. Additionally, governments can collaborate with social marketing agencies and NGOs to raise awareness about the potential adverse effects of excessive social media use, particularly focusing on protecting young people who are more susceptible to its negative impacts. Originality/value This research stands out as one of the few studies examining the potential negative aspects of SMBC activities, offering a meaningful addition to the existing body of literature on SMBC and psychological ill-being. Grounded in the theory of compensatory Internet use and the stressor-strain-outcome model, it provides valuable insights into the darker side of consumer social media escapism and participation in SMBCs, particularly in relation to their psychological ill-being.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Short videos serve as a crucial medium for disseminating health information, playing a significant role in enhancing users’ health literacy and guiding their health behaviors. However, existing research has yet to clarify the mechanisms influencing the credibility judgment of health information in short video formats, distinct from traditional textual information. This study aims to identify the key factors influencing the credibility judgment of health-related short videos (HSVs) and to develop a reliable mechanistic model for judging their credibility. Design/methodology/approach A sequential mixed-methods combining qualitative and quantitative research was employed. Using grounded theory, we identified 17 factors influencing the credibility judgment of HSVs and developed a model outlining the mechanisms behind these judgments. Five key influencing factors were identified through Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (Fuzzy-DEMATEL), and their pathways were validated using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings The publisher professionalism, content quality, cumulative system cues and external validation significantly positively impact credibility judgment of HSVs. Additionally, health information discernment efficacy positively and negatively moderates the effects of content quality and external validation on credibility judgment of HSVs, while the moderating effects of publisher professionalism and cumulative system cues are not significant. Originality/value The study provides an in-depth analysis of the key pathways affecting the credibility judgment of HSVs, enhancing our understanding of credibility of HSVs. Additionally, it expands the theoretical framework and research contexts within the field of credibility research, offering a case reference for the advancement and application of mixed methods.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The pervasive spread of commercial misinformation on social media poses significant risks to businesses and brands, with potentially devastating consequences for their reputation and financial stability. Given its unique nature and far-reaching impact, it is imperative to investigate and develop effective strategies to counteract this growing threat. Based on inoculation theory, this study aims to investigate the mechanisms and long-term effects of different inoculation strategies in the context of commercial misinformation. Design/methodology/approach A randomized controlled trial and follow-up experiment were conducted with 569 valid participants over 2 waves in a 6-week longitudinal study. Hypotheses were tested using one-way ANOVA, post-hoc analysis and regression analysis. Findings Data analysis indicates that inoculation can effectively enhance individuals' resistance to misinformation. Affective inoculation, compared to cognitive inoculation, more significantly strengthens individuals' threat perceptions of misinformation, subsequently reducing the perceived credibility of misinformation upon exposure. In this process, individuals' self-efficacy in identifying misinformation plays a moderating role, reinforcing the negative impact of perceived threat on the credibility of misinformation. The resistance effect of inoculation against misinformation persists for more than six weeks. However, there is no significant difference between the long-term effects of affective and cognitive inoculation, nor is there a significant relationship between the frequency of inoculation and its long-term effectiveness. Research limitations/implications The study offers practical insights for governments, platforms, organizations and individuals in the preemptive intervention against misinformation. Originality/value This research significantly advances the field of misinformation governance by extending its application scenarios, expanding the theoretical landscape of inoculation studies and providing valuable insights into both immediate and enduring effects of psychological inoculation strategies.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The presence of unverifiable, inaccurate, and irrelevant information during disasters can encourage people to withdraw from virtual communities. One way to combat this problem is to cultivate a sense of community. However, little is known about how a sense of community can be fostered quickly in virtual communities during a disaster. Our study addresses this limitation of prior research work. Design/methodology/approach We conducted an in-depth qualitative case study of a Reddit community during Hurricane Harvey. The main sources were archival data, including community threads and associated comments. Data from newspapers, magazine reports and government websites were also collected to capture contextual information about the disaster. Findings Our findings indicate that socialisation and formal control can foster a sense of community. This is made possible through the strategic use of social media, which involves (1) endorsing emergent norms and (2) enforcing those norms through a disciplining process. Practical implications We offer practical suggestions for virtual community moderators and members on strategically using social media features to create, enforce and institutionalise emergent norms. We recommend that system designers develop adaptable social media features that can be reconfigured according to the context. Originality/value We show how socialisation and formal control must coexist in virtual communities to foster a sense of community, rather than prioritising one over the other. We also unpack how the strategic use of social media can inform this process. We argue that social media features should be adaptable, rather than pre-set, to meet emergent needs.",

The moderating roles of self-regulation and need-fulfillment focus are examined. Design/methodology/approach A total of 497 valid responses from Indonesian consumers (Study 1) and 273 from US consumers (Study 2) were analyzed using structural equation modeling to empirically evaluate the proposed research model. Findings The results showed that stronger human brand attachment contributed to problematic human brand engagement on social media, which subsequently led to social media-induced sleep problems (i.e. poor social media sleep hygiene, problematic sleep and exhaustion). These effects were intensified by higher self-regulation, especially when consumer need-fulfillment was more promotion-focused (vs prevention-focused). Originality/value This research is among the few studies to highlight the dark side of consumer–human brand relationships in the digital realm. It advances research on social media-induced sleep problems from the perspective of consumer–human brand relationships, offering insights to consumers, parents and governments to inform preventive measures.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The study investigated the potential role of social media influencers (SMIs) in engaging users with low motivation to participate in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities by examining how the interplay among endorser type, argument quality and audiences’ cause involvement affects consumers’ information processing and authenticity judgments of CSR messages. Design/methodology/approach The current study employed an online experiment (n = 386) with a 2 (CSR argument quality: Strong vs. Weak) by 2 (Endorser Type: SMI vs. Brand) between-subjects design. Findings Individuals with low involvement with climate change relied more heavily on source credibility cues, while those with high involvement scrutinized the argument quality of the CSR message by dedicating more cognitive efforts. Although the authenticity of a SMI-promoted CSR message with strong argument quality was boosted, that of a weak message promoted by the SMI significantly decreased. Practical implications The findings regarding differential processing of CSR information by different key audiences based on their motivational factors provide guidance for companies on how to inform and engage different types of the public about social causes. The study recommends organizations to segment the audiences according to social media engagement levels and tailor their strategies. Originality/value This is one of the first studies to explore how users’ cause involvement on social media can shape their processing routes in evaluating the authenticity of CSR messages. By drawing on the elaboration likelihood model to the realm of strategic communication, the study uncovered the importance of tailoring source and message strategies to users with a varying degree of motivation.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate gender, racial, and religious biases among four popular Generative AI (GAI) chatbots, namely ChatGPT3.5, ChatGPT4, Gemini, and Bing Chat. Design/methodology/approach Based on existing literature, this paper develops the Bias Assessment Test Set (BATS) comprising 900 closed-ended prompts and 12 pairs of open-ended prompts related to gender, race, and religion. A total of 34,227 numerical responses collected were analyzed using consistency analysis, Welch’s ANOVA, and the Scheirer-Ray-Hare test. The themes of a total of 94,821 narratives freely generated by the GAI chatbots were also analyzed using the topic modeling method and sentiment analysis. Findings Findings suggested that ChatGPT4 and Gemini were generally less biased and provided more consistent responses compared to ChatGPT3.5 and Bing Chat. Additionally, all chatbots covered various themes in stereotypical and anti-stereotypical contexts, typically manifesting in an unequal representation of target groups within each theme, as well as different emphases and negative tendencies across the themes. Research limitations/implications This paper broadens the concept of algorithmic bias by highlighting its granularity and bi-directionality. It also offers a novel perspective on algorithmic justice by revealing thematic prejudices in generative AI chatbot narratives. Nonetheless, a few limitations must be acknowledged. This paper does not capture AI’s evolving biases. It neither addresses intersectionality among different social types of discrimination nor considers user perceptions.

          "authors": "Qiushi Wang, Ping Han, Shuwei Hao",
          "abstract": "Purpose This research investigates how influencer streamers' strategies, which combine their responses to backward-looking and forward-looking responsibility, repair consumers' cognitive trust (CT) and affective trust (AT) damaged by product failures in live streaming commerce. It also examines the mediating role of consumer forgiveness and the moderating role of consumers' perceived parasocial interaction with influencer streamers. Design/methodology/approach Two scenario-based experimental studies were conducted to test the proposed hypotheses. Data were analyzed using the analysis of covariance and bootstrap methods. Findings The influencer streamers' strategy of taking both backward-looking and forward-looking responsibility is as effective in repairing consumers' CT and AT as the strategy of taking only forward-looking responsibility. When consumers perceive higher levels of parasocial interaction with influencer streamers, these responsibility-taking strategies are more effective in enhancing their forgiveness, which in turn improves their trust in influencer streamers. Practical implications To effectively repair consumer trust after live-streamed product failures, influencer streamers should prioritize taking responsibility for resolving these failures rather than clarifying their responsibility for causing them. Efforts to strengthen parasocial interaction with consumers can allow influencer streamers to improve the effectiveness of their responsibility-taking strategies. Originality/value This research is among the first to extend the scope of trust repair research to the context of live streaming commerce and to tailor responsibility-taking strategies for influencer streamers who are trustees with collateral responsibility for transgressions. It also provides novel insights into the critical role of parasocial interaction in facilitating the effective repair of consumer trust in influencer streamers.",

          "abstract": "Purpose With esports debuting as a medal event in international multi-sport competitions, the personal branding strategies of esports athletes remain underexamined despite the industry’s rapid expansion. This study addresses this gap by exploring how esports athlete brands evolve when they are perceived as national symbols on the global stage. Design/methodology/approach This study adopts an interpretivist and constructivist paradigm, employing a multi-method approach that integrates netnographic observation, semiotic analysis of social media posts and 22 semi-structured interviews. This combination of methods enables a comprehensive examination of how athletes’ social media posts, media narratives and fan-generated content collectively shape their brand images of esports athletes. Findings The findings reveal that national identity shapes esports athletes’ branding in international events, extending beyond national representation to broader cultural and social dynamics shaped by hyperconnectivity. Fans align with state-regulated agenda-setting for player opportunities while fearing esports’ mainstreaming, which diminishes personal expression and erodes subcultural distinctiveness. Research limitations/implications Esports athletes can elevate their marketability by integrating national identity, fan culture and cross-sport collaborations, but their brand narratives are often shaped by state regulations and cultural expectations. Maintaining authenticity under such constraints requires institutional support, strategic content planning and a nuanced understanding of how to balance individual identity with broader expectations of national representation. Originality/value This study is one of the first to explore the personal branding process of esports athletes and fans’ behaviour in international multi-sport events. It informs esports athletes, state governments and agencies on strategies for enhancing the marketability of esports athletes.",

This study explores complex causal pathways by examining digital transformation management capacity, strategic digital vision, organizational mindfulness, organizational change capacity, market turbulence and firm type as potential predictors of firm performance. Design/methodology/approach The study integrates fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) and artificial neural networks (ANN). fsQCA identifies equifinal configurations from a sample of employees directly involved in digital transformation initiatives. The ANN analysis assesses the predictive power of these configurations to reveal the relative importance of each predictor. Findings The results identify three equifinal configurations that lead to high firm performance, highlighting how different combinations of organizational (i.e. digital transformation management capacity, strategic digital vision, organizational mindfulness and organizational change capacity) and environmental (i.e. market turbulence and firm type) conditions can generate similar outcomes. These findings underscore the interplay of multiple factors in preventing the paradox of digitalization. Meanwhile, the ANN analysis indicates that organizational change capacity is the most critical predictor of firm performance. Practical implications The findings provide strategies for leveraging digital transformation to enhance firm performance. Firms can achieve this by fostering adaptability, implementing ongoing digital initiatives or developing strategic digital programs using tools like real-time analytics, cross-functional teams and AI-driven platforms. Originality/value The study advances a non-linear perspective on digital transformation and firm performance by using fsQCA to capture equifinality (multiple distinct pathways yielding similar outcomes) and ANN to identify the relative importance of each causal condition.",

Drawing on multiple disciplines and prior work from communication and social psychology, an interactionist perspective is reviewed and applied to computational settings to demonstrate how individual, interpersonal, social, and situational factors afford or constrain verbal behavior. Using examples of language complexity and processing fluency research, this paper demonstrates how contextual factors like instrumental goal activation can reverse seemingly established relationships between simple language features and behavioral outcomes. The paper concludes by advocating for methodological approaches that systematically integrate contextual variables into natural language processing research, enabling scholars to resolve contradictory findings, enhance replicability, and develop a more nuanced understanding of how language reveals psychological processes.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: The current exploratory interview study investigates the link between media use and political identity formation in an authoritarian regime context – Turkey. It aims to find out how emerging adults achieve identity exploration and commitment in a country that is characterized by violations of civil liberties and human rights infringements. In such contexts, the political identity development of emerging adults is likely to draw on alternative, non-conventional forms of engagement such as media use. But the complex relationship between political identity development and media use in emerging adults is so far understudied. In the current study, semi-structured interviews were carried out with a purposeful sample of N = 22 emerging adults and subjected to an inductive coding procedure. Findings reveal four pathways of identity exploration and commitment through media, especially social and entertainment media, displaying the highly agentic nature of identity formation: (1) Discovering uncharted paths and authenticity in safe spaces; (2) Oscillating between approach and reproach; (3) Issue-based personalized commitment embedded in lived experience; (4) Validating one’s views – disengaging from conventional politics. In Turkey, emerging adults resort to alternative covert spaces and endorse non-conventional exploration and commitment activities within social media, entertainment media, their social networks, as well as the arts, forming oppositional political identities driven by lived experience.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: For some, negative news increases negative affect, harms mental well-being, and reduces news consumption. Others, however, cope better with recurring news negativity. We propose that differences in emotional regulation strategies explain, at least partly, these varied responses to negative news. In a preregistered, longitudinal intensive diary study (7 days) with a diverse, predominantly Western European sample ( N = 120), we examine to what extent emotion regulation strategies are associated with negative affect, mental well-being, and news use frequency. Our findings indicate that cognitive reappraisal and selective attention effectively down-regulate negative emotions arising from news use. However, distraction and suppression showed no statistically significant effects on affect, well-being, or news consumption. This study provides initial evidence that emotion regulation strategies help explain individual differences in responses to negative news and lays the groundwork for a research agenda in communication science exploring the role of emotion regulation in media effects.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can write humanlike, context-aware messages and thus can aid individuals in their communication with others. Existing research suggests that using GenAI may be regarded as inappropriate or undesirable in certain interpersonal contexts, but acceptable in others. Yet, few studies have articulated the reasons underlying such context-dependent preferences. Taking a functional approach, we conducted an online survey ( N = 542) to explore how GenAI use might depend on an individual’s goals in interpersonal communication and to unravel the reasons why an individual may or may not use GenAI in specific contexts. Among the participants who had used GenAI in their interpersonal communication with others ( n = 240), we found that GenAI was most often used for goals of information and resource exchange. When message production for a goal requires more of one’s subjective experience (e.g., providing emotional support, showing others who you are), individuals are less likely to use GenAI in such contexts. Other contextual factors, including whether message production for a goal is difficult and whether it requires objectivity or human knowledge, were not found to predict GenAI use. These findings contribute to the theories and research in human–AI interaction and message production, while also informing the future design of human-centered AI.",

          "abstract": "Long-distance romantic relationships (LDRRs) are increasingly common, yet research directly comparing them to cohabitating romantic relationships (CRRs) remains limited. In this pre-registered study, we used a multinational, six-wave longitudinal dataset collected during the COVID-19 pandemic ( N observations = 1,772) and applied propensity score matching to compare LDRRs and CRRs on two core relational outcomes: conflict and passion. Drawing on Relational Dialectics Theory and the Relational Turbulence Model, we hypothesized that spending more time with one’s partner would have distinct effects depending on relationship type—predicting that LDRRs would benefit more from increased time together, while CRRs would experience more conflict and reduced passion. Contrary to these predictions, we found that LDRRs, on average, reported lower conflict and higher passion than CRRs. Furthermore, across both relationship types, increased time spent with one’s partner was associated with lower conflict and more passion. We also observed meaningful heterogeneity: of those who completed three or more waves, approximately 19% of individuals experienced patterns contrary to the typical decreases in conflict and increases in passion. Taken together, these findings suggest that, rather than exacerbating relationship difficulties, increased time together during a global crisis may enhance relational well-being for most couples. Our use of matched samples, within-person modeling, and estimation of heterogeneity offers a rigorous test of long-distance relationship dynamics and challenges common assumptions about relational fragility during periods of stress. These results contribute to a more nuanced understanding of relationship functioning under constraint and highlight the resilience of LDRRs in the face of global disruption.",

          "abstract": "Ostracism threatens the fundamental need to belong. When children are ostracized, a myriad of psychosocial and emotional consequences may occur. Parents hold a key role in guiding their children through difficult peer situations and mitigating their effects. However, there is a dearth of research that examines how children’s peer experiences affect their parents. The current study examines the relationship between parents’ playground recollections and subsequent affective reactions to their children’s experience of ostracism. 250 parents observed their children ostracized during a game of Cyberball and reported affect using the PANAS-C/P (Ebesutani, 2012). Then, each parent reported their recollections of their childhood playground experiences. Parents’ childhood experiences were coded as positive, negative, or anxious/lonely (Putallaz et al., 1991). Parents with positive playground recollections were more negatively affected by their children’s ostracism than parents with anxious/lonely recollections. Parents with positive, negative, and anxious/lonely playground recollections experience different levels of negative affect scores depending on the gender of their child. Parents of girls experienced lower levels of negative affect when they had anxious/lonely past recollections. These results suggest a link between parents’ anxious/lonely childhood experiences and subsequent affective reactions to their children’s experiences of peer rejection. Future studies may explore the relationship among parents’ experiences of ostracism, their affective responses to their children’s ostracism, and subsequent parenting and coping strategies.",

          "abstract": "On-again/off-again cycling is prevalent, and partners in these relationships experience lower relational quality and more negative interaction patterns, increasing their risk for compromised relational and individual health. Conceptualizing relationship cycling as a chronic stressor, we assessed the association between cycling, relational stress, and compromised well-being (i.e., psychological and physical symptoms). Findings from four samples ( N s ranged from 99–383) showed: (1) cyclical partners reported more relational stress and psychological symptoms than non-cyclical partners, (2) the number of breakup-renewal cycles was positively associated with relational stress, (3) negative interaction patterns interacted with cycling to predict relational stress and (4) cycling was indirectly associated with compromised well-being (i.e., psychological and physical symptoms) through relational stress. Collectively, these suggest cycling is a chronic stressor, and partners’ cycling and negative interaction patterns may compound in creating relational stress. Consequently, additional research is warranted to test a proposed model integrating relationship and stress theories to unpack how cycling is associated with stress and well-being over time.",

Based on 15 semi-structured interviews with journalists who have first-hand experience managing outsourced government social media accounts, and grounded in boundary work theory, this study examines how journalists navigate the tension between journalism and propaganda in relation to their role identity, work routines, and professional values. Findings reveal that outsourced journalists, often referred to as &lt;em&gt;Xiaobian&lt;/em&gt;, occupy a contested hybrid position. Their identity negotiation is constrained by dual pressures from both government agencies and news organizations, leaving limited room for professional autonomy. In their daily practices, bureaucratic logic takes precedence over journalistic logic, intensifying the tension between serving the state and serving the public. These dynamics highlight journalism’s boundary crossing in the digital era, shaped by changing economic and political conditions within the media landscape.",

In this study, we attempt to provide a broad systemic analysis of fandom, using a survey of 4874 fans who use the fan fiction posting site, Archive of Our Own. Through our analysis, we examine the interplay of fan identity with their practices: what type of romantic content fans prefer and which platforms fans prefer to use. We find that both romantic content and platform preference are shaped by fans’ identities, which provides important insights into broad patterns of how identity impacts behavior among fan fiction writers and readers across fandoms.",

Specifically, I advance the concept of ‘algorithmic selfing’ to indicate a form of processual Self that is temporarily constructed and incessantly reconstructed within the temporal relationships individuals develop with algorithmic media. This process of algorithmic selfing occurs through three interrelated dynamics: (1) algorithmic individuation, (2) algorithmic transduction and (3) recursivity. The result is a ‘worldly dwelling’ that emerges in a relationship conflated with the objectives, logic and operations of tech companies. To do so, the article draws on empirical studies on digital time and identity, on the application of existential philosophy to media theory, on critical algorithm studies and communication theory. Building on this framework, the article explores the ontological and epistemological implications of the process of algorithmic selfing, offering insights for social, philosophical and media theory.",

However, despite the ability of new communication technologies to facilitate a change in perceived time via virtual time travel, there is scant empirical work testing the predictors and psychological and persuasive outcomes of temporal presence. To fill this gap, this study employed a single-factor experiment using an augmented reality (AR) filter with two conditions (virtual time travel with AR [ n = 63] vs without AR [ n = 77]) in the context of anti-aging sunscreen advertising. Results showed that temporal presence can be evoked by virtual time travel using AR through perceived interactivity and vividness. Temporal presence subsequently increased positive attitude toward the ad and brand, as well as purchase intentions through different psychological factors.",

Although previous research has already described its different forms, motives, and consequences, we herein strengthen respective research by providing an inductively derived, broad framework of the forms, content, dominant motives, and consequences of dishonesty in romantic relationships. To this end, participants ( N = 656) were asked to describe the most vivid, common, or recent incident when they were dishonest to their current ( n = 455) or former ( n = 175) romantic partner, or what they might be dishonest about in a hypothetical future romantic relationship ( n = 26). Based on content analysis, augmented with latent content analysis for the motives and consequences of dishonesty, we find support for the existence of four forms (active deception, lies, withholding information, and infidelity), eight content areas (e.g., finances, sexuality), and two dominant motives of dishonesty in romantic relationships, self and (alleged) partner protection. Finally, we find support for 18 kinds of perceived and narrated consequences of dishonesty in romantic relationships (e.g., The Vicious Cycle ).",

          "abstract": "For decades, research on journalism’s role in society has examined an array of role orientations, spanning from neutral disseminator to advocate. Regarding reporting on climate change mitigation, however, the question takes on new relevance. In that context, is balanced reporting still appropriate or being replaced due to a greater demand for evidence-based reporting? Is journalism responsible for taking a stance, politically mobilizing its audiences, and reporting activist? Can neutral dissemination and activist journalism even be expected to occur simultaneously? To answer those questions, we surveyed 2,577 German citizens and 391 political journalists regarding their expectations/role orientations and evaluations of balance, weight of evidence (WoE), and activist journalism in reporting on climate change mitigation. The results show that citizens expect balanced, evidence-based reporting on climate change mitigation. Journalists also see it as their role to report balanced and evidence-based in this context, even despite the risk of false balance. Meanwhile, though citizens tend to expect activist journalism, journalists reject it as part of their role. Moreover, our results show that WoE and activist journalism are not mutually exclusive but are expected to occur simultaneously. Last, citizens and journalists who favor stricter climate measures generally expect activist journalism in reporting on climate change mitigation.",

          "authors": "Kim Andersen, Adam Shehata",
          "abstract": "Prior research suggests that individuals not only prefer negative news over positive (negativity bias in news selection) but also favor information that aligns with their existing beliefs (confirmation bias). A likely consequence of these tendencies is that people will, on average, form beliefs that are biased toward perceiving reality as more negative, and that these dynamics will be mutually reinforcing over time. This study presents a preregistered longitudinal choice experiment designed to examine these dynamics in relation to negative and positive emphasis framing of news stories about Swedish schools. Contrary to the hypothesis of a general negativity bias in news selection, the results indicate a higher preference for positive news. However, the results support the expectation of a confirmation bias, as people with more negative (positive) beliefs were more like to choose negative (positive) news. Moreover, exposure to both positive and negative news led to more positive beliefs over time, suggesting that information effects were more influential than framing effects. Together, these findings challenge central claims within the literature on biases in news selection and their subsequent influence on societal beliefs.",

          "authors": "Xiao Lu",
          "abstract": "This article reviews Ba Wang Bian , a contemporary dance fusing ethnic traditions with modern movements, performed by Chinese dancer Maya Jilan Dong and produced by British artistic director Farooq Chaudhry. Through choreographic semiotics and kinesthetic discourse, this artwork embodies the Daoist articulation of feminine power, which derives from self-identification and somatic-ecological harmony.",

          "title": "A three-step manual for creating a political villain: the case of Jeremy Corbyn",
          "authors": "Maximillian Guarini",
          "abstract": "This manual guides the reader through the process of creating a political villain with three easy-to-follow steps. Readers may wish to create their own political villains (there is no shortage of politicians on which to practise), or simply use it to better understand how political villains are created and more critically engage with this type of multimodal construction. The case of Jeremy Corbyn in the UK is utilized to make this process as evident and clear as possible. Corbyn’s case reveals how power operates in the everyday through multimodal constructions. Overall, this is a manual which exposes how images and words work together to persuade us of particular messages. In an age that sees us constantly exposed to many multimodal messages, this visual essay sheds some light on important points for us all to consider as both willing and unwilling consumers of media. Its focus is on the how of multimodal construction rather than on the why.",

          "title": "Visual compositing: engagement, interpretation and visualization of Holocaust memory in digital culture",
          "authors": "Lital Henig",
          "abstract": "Archival images of the Holocaust have been and continue to be an essential component of Holocaust memory and representation. In recent years, Holocaust memory projects have begun using these images in fragmented forms – copied, cut and pasted into new configurations. This article will explore this visual trend and examine it through the concept of visual compositing: layering images to create a new understanding of their collective symbolism. Through visual analysis of recent digital and non-digital Holocaust memory works, the article analyses the practice of visual compositing and its influence on recent Holocaust memory. By exploring recent works through diachronic and synchronic axes, the author argues that visual compositing influences both the visual representation of Holocaust memory and the memory work involved in this kind of representation. While engaging in visual compositing, creators generate or invite others to create new representations of the Holocaust. This act offers opportunities to explore the past from new perspectives, but also risks diminishing the singularity and specificity of the represented experiences. The article concludes by showing how visual compositing calls for adopting a new visual literacy for Holocaust representation and memory, working in and evolving with digital culture.",
