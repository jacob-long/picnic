          "authors": "Merlin Schaeffer, Krzysztof Krakowski, Asmus Leth Olsen",
          "abstract": "The disadvantages experienced by minorities and lack of societal remedies are partly attributable to native‐majority citizens’ limited awareness of minority hardships. We investigate whether informing citizens about field‐experimental audits on ethno‐racial discrimination increases their recognition of the issue and support for equal‐treatment policies. Extending a largely US‐centric research frontier, we focus on beliefs about discrimination faced by Muslims in Denmark. To further comprehension, we test three types of framing: a scientist stressing credibility, a lawyer emphasizing the legal breach, or a minority expressing grief. Our survey experiment ( n  = 4,800) shows that citizens are generally aware of discrimination and tend to overperceive its extent. Communicating audit evidence corrects misperceptions but does not change recognition or policy support, regardless of framing or initial misperception. Only combining priming, correction, and framing temporarily increases recognition and donations to support groups. These findings suggest that audit‐based awareness campaigns have limited immediate success beyond donations acknowledging minority hardships.",

          "authors": "Andreas Kyriacou, Pedro Trivin",
          "abstract": "Existing work sees populist governments undermining the rule of law because they seek to dismantle institutional constraints on their personalistic plebiscitarian rule. We argue that populist rulers pose a greater threat to legal impartiality, equality, and compliance when they face a legacy of weak rule of law. We find empirical support for this assertion after applying synthetic control methods to a cross‐country sample that includes up to 51 populist events spanning the period from 1920 to 2019. Our results remain consistent across a range of robustness checks including, the consideration of a set of contextual variables that can potentially determine the capacity of populist governments to sweep away institutional constraints, different populist event classifications, and different ways of measuring the rule of law. In countries, like the United States, with a robust rule of law tradition, the deleterious impact of populists on institutions will be limited but not negligible.",

          "authors": "Sharon Baute, Tobias Tober",
          "abstract": "Since the 1950s, the history of European integration unfolds as a unique social experiment, witnessing the transformation of a non-existent entity into an increasingly institutionalized force. This article delves into the consequences of this ongoing institutionalization on public attitudes towards the institution itself: the European Union (EU). We argue that as European institutional integration advanced, a divide in EU support between more and less educated individuals emerged, with the latter becoming progressively less supportive. Drawing on data from eighty-five waves of the Eurobarometer survey across fifteen countries and over 820,000 individuals from 1976 to 2014, a Bayesian mixed-effects analysis reveals that the gap in support between the more and less educated significantly widened with a country's level of institutional integration. This study emphasizes the necessity of distinguishing institutional effects from temporal patterns in order to enhance our understanding of EU-related public opinion dynamics.",

          "authors": "FABIAN HABERSACK",
          "abstract": "Political parties often adjust their policy agendas in response to changing electoral landscapes, balancing the need to appeal to new voters against the importance of retaining loyal supporters. While these patterns are generally well‐documented in the literature, the specific impact of voter availability on the electoral market remains underexamined. This article investigates how electoral opportunities – i.e., potential to mobilize new voters – and loyalty – i.e., likelihood of retaining current supporters – influence parties' decisions to expand or narrow their policy focus. To analyze this, the study integrates three decades of population data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems and European Election Studies with data on parties' issue focus obtained from the Manifesto Project. The analysis shows that parties strategically balance their focus between core and peripheral issues based on the anticipated utility of each approach. This strategy, however, depends on the stability of voter loyalty: expansion into new issues occurs primarily when voter loyalty is robust, although strong opportunities alone can also encourage agenda broadening. These findings contribute to understanding the calculated risks parties take in adjusting their issue attention and highlight why policy adjustments often backfire; namely, when misaligned with voters' availability on the market. This study speaks to the literature on party competition and representation in Europe, illuminating how electoral dynamics shape parties' policy focus.",

          "authors": "JORIS FRESE, JUHO HÄRKÖNEN, SIMON HIX",
          "abstract": "Public support for Brexit has declined since the 2016 referendum. We argue that part of this decline is due to cohort replacement where many older voters (who support Brexit) have passed away, while younger voters (who oppose Brexit) have entered the electorate. Using a series of original YouGov surveys from 2016, 2018, 2020 and 2022, each representative of the UK electorate, we first demonstrate the large and stable differences in Brexit support between younger and older voters. Next, we employ demographic decomposition calculations to estimate that cohort replacement alone accounts for approximately one third of the decline in aggregate Brexit support in just 6 years (with two thirds of the decline being explained by within‐cohort changes). Furthermore, by combining our data on Brexit support with Office for National Statistics cohort projections up to 2030, we derive testable hypotheses about the pressure that cohort replacement will continue to put on Brexit support over the next decade across a wide range of potential scenarios. Altogether, our study demonstrates the powerful role that cohort replacement plays in shaping British (and European) politics in the post‐Brexit world.",

          "authors": "Joseph T. Ornstein, Amanda J. Heideman, Bryant J. Moy, Kaylyn Jackson Schiff",
          "abstract": "Every year, Americans elect hundreds of thousands of candidates to local public office, typically in low-attention, nonpartisan races. How do voters evaluate candidates in these sorts of elections? Previous research suggests that, absent party cues, voters rely on a set of heuristic shortcuts – including the candidate’s name, profession, and interest group endorsements – to decide whom to support. In this paper, we suggest that community embeddedness – a candidate’s roots and ties to the community – is particularly salient in these local contests. We present evidence from a conjoint survey experiment on a nationally representative sample of American voters. We estimate the marginal effect on vote share of candidate attributes such as gender, race, age, profession, interest group endorsements, and signals of community embeddedness – specifically homeownership and residency duration. We find that voters, regardless of political party, have strong preferences for community embeddedness. Strikingly, the magnitude of the residency duration effect rivals that of prior political experience.",

          "abstract": "Conjoint experiments have enabled scholars to understand the preferences of citizens in a variety of political contexts. We propose a method to modify the standard text-only “box conjoint” to make the treatment higher in external validity with respect to a common target context. Citizens frequently encounter political information encoded as images and in particular in the form of politicians’ social media posts and profiles. We deploy “visual conjoint” experiments where subjects select between two images that encode the same explicit information as is standard in the box conjoint. We conduct an experiment in which we randomize the modality of a conjoint experiment where subjects evaluate the Twitter profiles of hypothetical candidates. We demonstrate that the visual conjoint more effectively encodes image-based information and social endorsement information. The visual conjoint also allows the salience of different attributes to vary naturally the way they do on social media, in contrast to the artificially enforced uniformity of the box conjoint.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate whether symptoms of depression affect the relationship between partisanship—one of the most important predictors of electoral behavior—and vote choice. Building on research from mood and depressive realism, we argue that symptoms of depression reduce the association between the strength of partisanship and vote choice because depressed mood can lead to better, clearer thinking. We evaluate and find support for this hypothesis using survey data from Britain, Spain, and the Netherlands. Our findings improve our understanding of the political consequences of depression, one of the most prevalent mental health problems in contemporary democracies.",

          "abstract": "Territorial contestations entrench opposed groups within tight political and psychological constraints, seemingly rendering improvements to intergroup relations intractable. In this paper, we examine political theater as a novel tool for enabling intergroup dialogue to transform social representations of intergroup relations. Participants are selected leaders from two groups involved in a territorial conflict in the Philippines: community leaders of the Guardians of the Marsh ( N = 7), closely entwined with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front; and Christian sociologists doing peace projects at the Mindanao State University—General Santos City ( N = 5). We describe the design and implementation of a set of culturally embedded, participatory, and power‐sensitive theater exercises to facilitate intergroup dialogue between community leaders. Through a mixed methods analytical strategy, we compare participants' theater utterances in the first and second halves of the workshop. Triangulated results from quantitative and qualitative analysis show shifts in social representations toward more just and trusting intergroup relationships. The study affirms the usefulness of political theater as a tool for intergroup dialogue, customized to conditions of asymmetric conflict between two groups embroiled in territorial conflict. Furthermore, we caution against using conventional intergroup dialogue as a tool for peacebuilding, when features of dialogue support the underlying structural foundations of inequality and muted resentments.",

          "authors": "Theresa Gessler, Fabrizio Gilardi, Maël Kubli",
          "abstract": "An unresolved aspect of women's underrepresentation in politics is the media portrayal of female candidates. This paper studies how advocacy campaigns may affect potential bias, leveraging the 2019 Swiss federal elections, which were shaped by two nation-wide, cross-party campaigns advocating for gender equality. The empirical analysis compares the 2015 and 2019 election campaigns, relying on an original dataset of the mentions that all candidates (over 3,700 respectively 4,600) received in over 2.2 million news articles. The analysis produces three main results. First, although in both elections male candidates received more media attention than female candidates did, the gender gap was significantly smaller in 2019 than in 2015. Second, in both elections, male and female candidates tended to be mentioned in conjunction with gender-stereotypical topics. Third, the gender gap in media attention before and after a key women's rights event was similar to that between the corresponding periods in 2015. These findings suggest that the differences observed between 2015 and 2019 are linked to the political campaign at large rather than to a specific event, despite its historical dimensions. The results contribute to the understanding of how advocacy campaigns can change bias in media coverage and, methodologically, to measuring and understanding gendered media coverage of politics.",

          "title": "Policy Feedback, Energy Equity, and Climate Justice: Can Existing Policies Improve Solar Access for Low- and Moderate-Income Communities in the United States?",
          "authors": "Aparajita Datta",
          "abstract": "Despite the proliferation of rooftop solar in the United States, its deployment and associated benefits have not been distributed equitably. Many states have adopted targeted incentives to improve access to rooftop solar and increase its uptake among low- and moderate-income (LMI) communities. This article examines the policy feedback effects of energy efficiency policies and electricity-sector portfolio standards on the adoption and diffusion of LMI solar incentives across states. Event History Analyses indicate that between 2010 and 2019, the adoption and diffusion of the incentives have been conditional on a state’s portfolio standards but independent of energy efficiency policies. Feedback effects from the portfolio standards in neighboring states are found to have a regressive impact on the likelihood of adoption. Hence, the feedback effects of previously adopted renewable energy policies are helping states to better serve vulnerable communities. However, there is no evidence of geographic clustering in the diffusion of incentives.",

          "authors": "Jonas Herby, Lars Jonung, Steve H. Hanke",
          "abstract": "Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, an unprecedented use of mandatory lockdowns—defined as the imposition of at least one compulsory, non-pharmaceutical intervention—took place. We conduct a meta-analysis to determine the effect of these lockdowns on COVID-19 mortality. Our meta-analysis finds that lockdowns in the spring of 2020 had a relatively small effect on COVID-19 mortality and is consistent with the view that voluntary changes in behavior, such as social distancing, played an important role in mitigating the pandemic. Given the enormous economic costs associated with lockdowns and our findings of the relatively small health benefits, the efficacy of lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic is called into question.",
