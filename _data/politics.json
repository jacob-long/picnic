          "title": "The Impact of Welfare on Intergroup Relations: Caste-Based Social Insurance and Social Integration in India",
          "authors": "AKSHAY GOVIND DIXIT",
          "abstract": "Religious and ethnic communities have long helped people cope with risks. Does state-provided welfare substitute for ethnicity-based social insurance? If so, does it improve intergroup relations? Ethnicity-based insurance operates through reciprocity and solidarity, requiring social investment in in-group ties. This limits the formation of out-group ties, exacerbating ethnic divisions. Welfare reduces dependence on the ethnic group, allowing individuals to form productive out-group ties and increasing intergroup integration. I test this argument in caste networks in India. I leverage panel data on household loans to show that an income support program reduced within-caste borrowing by 38.5%. Using survey data from 3,020 households, I show that welfare enhanced intercaste ties, mainly in areas with lower caste-based land inequality. I draw on 56 qualitative interviews to document how caste-based social insurance exacerbates social segregation, and why intercaste ties increase with lower group inequality. These findings illuminate the persistence and demise of ethnic divisions.",

          "abstract": "Does International Criminal Court (ICC) involvement affect the agreements parties to a civil conflict make, especially regarding matters of accountability? In this article, I argue that the ICC places a unique pressure on domestic elites negotiating peace in the wake of political violence. To avoid going to trial in the international arena, elites facing the threat of punishment have an incentive to agree to implement some form of domestic accountability, showing the Court that they can handle their own business. I evaluate my argument using data on the content of peace agreements negotiated between 2002 and 2019. I find that ICC involvement increases the probability that negotiators commit to accountability during peace processes. To explore potential mechanisms and more explicitly evaluate alternative explanations, I draw on case studies from Colombia and Sudan.",

          "authors": "JOAN BARCELÓ",
          "abstract": "Understanding the legacies of wartime violence is essential for explaining postwar dynamics and informing policy. I present a meta-analysis of 172 quantitative studies across more than 50 countries, assessing the effects of wartime violence on 22 outcomes spanning four broad areas: (a) civic and political engagement, prosociality, and trust; (b) attitudinal hardening toward wartime enemies; (c) identification with one’s own wartime-aligned group; and (d) generalized attitudinal hardening. The analysis reveals mixed effects on engagement, prosociality, and trust: while violence increases some forms of participation, it does not promote voting, trust, or altruism. In contrast, wartime violence consistently heightens hostility toward former adversaries and strengthens in-group identification and favoritism. However, I find little evidence of broader hardening toward actors not directly involved in the conflict. These results challenge optimistic claims that war fosters cohesion and underscore the need for interventions that reduce intergroup hostility, rebuild cross group-trust, and support reconciliation.",

          "abstract": "The scholarship on the concept of order has been expanding within international relations. The continuous upheaval of world politics first triggered a broad debate on the resilience of the liberal international order (LIO), which then led to scholarship on alternative conceptions of order, especially outside of the West. This review focuses on this body of research on non-Western views of order. It is structured geographically, taking a tour of scholarship from and on East and Southeast Asia, Latin America, Africa, South Asia and the Indo-Pacific, and Eurasia. Although each region has its own intellectual traditions, we observe that these views portray the LIO in a less idealized form, exposing its hierarchical and Western-centered nature. However, while pushing for more inclusive and plural arrangements, these critiques have not yet amounted to the articulation of radical alternative ordering projects.",

          "abstract": "Researchers often leverage exogenous variation in an independent variable in order to understand its effects, yet endogenous decision processes are central to many of the real-world phenomena we wish to understand. This review explores whether there are situations in which exogenous and endogenous variation in the same independent variable (e.g., a policy, treatment, or other action) may lead to different outcomes. I begin by laying out a conceptual framework for understanding these inherently endogenous causal processes, identifying three types of mechanisms through which they might arise and discussing their application to a range of empirical phenomena, such as institutional reform, community natural resource governance, and interstate conflict. I then suggest that learning about inherently endogenous causal processes requires researchers to place endogenous decision-making at the center of analysis rather than seeking to abstract away from it. I survey a range of methods (both positivist and nonpositivist) for doing so.",

While my early work centered on the political economy of the rich democracies in Europe, my focus has shifted and now centers on the study of the American political economy in comparative perspective, with an emphasis on corporate power and the role of the courts in the political economy.",

          "abstract": "In post-imperial European states, debates about imperial legacies – centred on issues such as colonial statues, police treatment of minorities, and school curricula – have intensified in recent years. Yet little systematic research examines public attitudes towards empire or their political impact. We develop a framework linking imperial nostalgia with political preferences and present findings from Britain using a national survey and conjoint experiment. First, we identify a distinct public opinion dimension on empire, ranging from nostalgic to critical. Second, we show that imperial nostalgia strongly predicts party evaluations and vote intentions, with effects comparable to those of immigration attitudes and left–right economic values. Finally, a conjoint experiment reveals that elite positions on empire influence voter preferences, but do so asymmetrically: right-wing opposition to criticism of the imperial past is stronger than left-wing support. These findings underscore the contemporary political relevance of imperial nostalgia in post-imperial Europe.",

          "abstract": "Since the 2010s, social scientists have increasingly conducted survey-experimental studies that explore what factors drive public attitudes towards migrants in host countries. We conducted a systematic meta-analysis of 118 such studies, comprising 428,881 respondents from fifty-three countries. We find that sociotropic economic concerns play a key role, with individuals being more welcoming towards migrants who contribute to the economy through their professional occupation, education, or language skills. In contrast, there is limited evidence that hosts evaluate migrants based on egocentric economic concerns. Cultural concerns are also important; notably, we uncover a persistent anti-Muslim bias. Humanitarian concerns shape attitudes as well – especially towards forcibly displaced migrants, who are generally viewed more favorably than economic migrants. Climate migrants place between conflict migrants and economic migrants in terms of public perception. Our meta-analysis raises several questions that remain unanswered in the literature, suggesting important directions for future research.",

          "abstract": "The movement of capital across borders has never been easier, as evidenced by the recent proliferation of offshore financial services. But these services are a double-edged sword: while boosting economic efficiency, they can also facilitate illicit financial activity. In this paper, we discuss the symbiotic relationship between financial liberalization and the pursuit of financial anonymity by secrecy-seeking actors. We examine a hide-and-seek dynamic between governments increasing monitoring of international finance and actors seeking anonymity via offshore financial centers. Under what conditions can international financial monitoring have the unintended consequence of increasing the use of poorly regulated and opaque offshore financial services? We examine this dynamic in the context of US targeted sanctions. Using the Office of Foreign Asset Control’s Specially Designated Nationals data and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists Offshore Leaks Database, we show that increases in US targeted sanctions provoke firms and individuals from targeted countries to seek low-supervision offshore financial centers.",

          "abstract": "Why do politicians sometimes deliver passionate speeches and sometimes tedious monologues? Even though the delivery is key to understanding political speech, we know little about when and why political actors choose particular delivery styles. Focusing on legislative speech, we expect legislators to deliver more emphatic speeches when their vote is aligned with the preferences of their constituents. To test this proposition, we develop and apply an automated video analysis model to speech recordings from the US House of Representatives. We match the speech emphasis with district preferences on key bills using data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study. We find that House members who rise in opposition to a bill give more passionate speeches when public preferences are aligned with their vote. The results suggest that political actors are not only mindful of public opinion in what they say but also in how they say it.",

          "abstract": "Scholarship has often examined the views of rural and working-class voters separately. In this article, I propose that we gain a broader understanding of the political potential of left-behind voters by comparing these voter groups. Drawing on three survey experiments, I investigate these voters’ views on deservingness and redistribution. The findings show that both rural and working-class voters are more likely to believe that cities and the people living there receive a disproportionate share of public resources. Furthermore, they favor rural people and working people equally as recipients of government resources. Both groups are supportive of redistribution, particularly along class lines. The article highlights a consensus among these voters, implying a potential for parties to mobilize these voter groups around a redistributive program that addresses place and class-based disparities.",

          "authors": "Werner Pitsch, Georg Wenzelburger",
          "abstract": "Studying lobbying influence in politics has been confronted with the challenge of gaining insights into processes that usually take place behind closed doors and about which honest answers from participants are difficult to obtain. Therefore, innovative methods of indirect measurement of lobby success – via text analysis or interviews – have been used to get at the hidden politics of lobbying. In this research note, we propose an additional technique to study lobby influence much more directly, the randomized response technique (RRT). This method has been successfully used to study doping in elite sports, for instance, but has been almost absent from political research in the past. The note presents the method and illustrates its applicability with a study of lobby influence in German Parliaments. The study reached out to 2386 present and to 850 former MPs (Members of Parliaments). The response dataset added up to 273 present and 160 former MPs, equaling response rates of 11.4% and 18.8% respectively. Despite these low response rates, it was nevertheless possible to estimate rates of lobby-friendly behavior among German MPs at comparably low rates of instruction noncompliance. Although the results should be interpreted cautiously due to the low response rate, the study demonstrates the viability of RRT surveys as a means to study sensitive issues in politics.",

          "title": "Voting against or against voting?",
          "authors": "Ming M. Boyer, Carolina Plescia, André Blais",
          "abstract": "Politics is increasingly negative, especially surrounding elections, raising concerns about mass disengagement and democratic backsliding. Despite these worries, the literature on how negativity in voting affects democratic attitudes and voting intentions is riddled with ambiguous and contradictory results. We argue that this may partly be due to the failure to distinguish between two types of negativity in voting: (a) understanding voting as a way to act against a specific party, politician, or policy (negative meanings of voting), and (b) opposition to voting itself (an anti-voting orientation). Contrasting these to the classical conception of voting to support a party, politician, or policy (positive meanings of voting), we conceptualize these constructs and validate their measurement in twelve countries, differing in geography, political systems, and levels of democracy ( N = 23,828). We arrive at two main conclusions. First, positive and negative meanings of voting are complementary and compatible attitudes. Modeling positive and negative voting separately rather than relative to each other shows a more nuanced picture of negative voting than previous work. Second, negative voting and anti-voting orientation are distinct types of negativity that relate differently to classical conceptions of voting and democratic attitudes. The first signals political dissatisfaction but belief in the electoral process. The second corresponds to such a disillusionment about voting that it inhibits dissatisfaction with democracy. As such, this distinction highlights the multifaceted nature of political negativity from a citizen perspective and helps clarify the relationship between negativity and democracy.",

However, due to measurement limitations, we lack research on who considers which issues important. Specifically, the often-used most-important-problem/issue question complicates between-individual comparisons of issue salience. Using a rarely employed measurement of issue salience and data from six Western European countries, this research note explores the salience of different issues across different socio-demographic groups. Our exploratory findings suggest that different socio-demographic variables affect different issues’ salience across and within individuals over time. Further, we find that predictors of individual-level issue salience and attitudes frequently differ – highlighting the importance of analysing them separately. We call for research on individual-level issue salience using measurements that enable the study of its determinants and analysing predictors of salience and attitudes separately.",

          "abstract": "Conflicts about ‘place’ are increasingly shaping the politics of advanced democracies, and voters are ever more divided along the urban-rural divide. However, this does not mean that members of all generations are growing apart. Instead, the urban-rural divide is stronger among younger generations, who are slowly replacing older, less divided ones. To demonstrate this, we combine post-election surveys from Switzerland spanning 28 years with macro data on the municipality level to examine the role of different cohorts in the urban-rural divide using age-period-cohort logistic regressions. The results reveal that the role of place is stronger for newer cohorts, with more recently socialized urbanites holding more progressive immigration attitudes and preferring left-wing parties compared to earlier urban cohorts. In contrast, whereas newer cohorts in urban contexts are less likely to vote for the far-right than their older neighbors, this is not the case for the same cohorts in more rural places. The results help to understand the role of generational replacement in explaining the growing differences between urban and rural citizens in Europe.",

          "abstract": "How do elections affect credit-claiming and blame-shifting patterns in times of crisis? To answer this so far unanswered yet relevant question for crisis management, this study analyses government crisis communication in Germany’s consensus democracy, where federal elections took place in the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Empirically, this study examines media conferences from January 2021 to December 2021, which reveal that the Minister of Health not only shifted responsibility and blame but also claimed credit – particularly before the election. He also opted for implicit rather than explicit forms of blame shifting within the political system and shifted responsibility to citizens. The strategies of citizen blaming and credit claiming were most frequent during the ‘federal emergency brake’ when responsibility was more centralised than in other moments of the pandemic. This research advances blame avoidance theory by combining situational factors (crisis and electoral pressure) and institutional moderators (form of government and governance structures) to explain credit-claiming and blame-shifting patterns. Overall, the findings of this study indicate that institutional factors can moderate blame games in particularly challenging situations when it is essential for political systems to address societal and underlying political problems instead of getting caught up in blame games.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the behavioral consequences of partisan group composition on cooperation in a setting where cooperation is mutually beneficial but unethical. Collaborative corruption highlights that corruption is not a solitary act but necessitates cooperation. Based on the premise that partisanship serves as a social identity, leading ordinary citizens to reward co-partisans and penalize out-partisans, we expect that collaborative corruption is higher in partisan-wise homogeneous groups. To test this expectation, we conducted a preregistered, large-scale experiment among U.S. voters playing an online version of the collaborative cheating game by Weisel and Shalvi. We find no evidence that partisan homogeneity affects collaborative cheating. These results suggest a critical scope condition: while partisan homogeneity improves cooperation in social dilemmas, it does not extend to contexts of unethical collaboration. They also refute common concerns that partisan homogeneity may facilitate cooperative corruption.",

          "authors": "Evan Drake",
          "abstract": "Despite international commitments to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, OECD countries exhibit substantial variation in subsidy levels. This study examines how governing party preferences and institutional context jointly shape subsidy policy across 28 OECD countries from 2010 to 2022. Integrating party manifesto data with fossil fuel subsidy levels in cabinet-year panels, the analysis reveals conditional relationships between governing party preferences and policy outcomes. Pro-environmental governments reduce subsidies primarily when holding parliamentary majorities, while market-liberal preferences show positive associations with subsidies under minority governance. Critically, the combination of environmental and market-liberal commitments produces the strongest subsidy reductions—but only within majority governments. This three-way interaction suggests that ‘green’ coalitions require institutional leverage to overcome entrenched fossil fuel interests and phase out fossil fuel subsidies. The findings demonstrate that neither ideology nor institutional capacity alone drives reform; both are necessary. These results help explain why OECD subsidy levels vary despite similar climate pledges, highlighting that translating electoral mandates into climate policy is contingent on both programmatic commitments and legislative control.",

          "authors": "Marko Kukec",
          "abstract": "The entry of new parties into governments is often met with skepticism concerning their ability of joint policymaking with established coalition partners. Upon assuming government responsibility, new parties are motivated to counteract such perceptions by demonstrating both their competence and cooperativeness. The article examines this double signaling strategy on the temporal dimension of legislation, by analyzing the timing of bill initiation in Czech and Slovenian cabinets between 2000 and 2022. The event history analysis of 1591 bills submitted by seven Czech cabinets and 1894 bills submitted by ten Slovenian cabinets suggests the presence of ‘competence signaling’ strategy in both countries, as new parties initiate their legislation sooner compared to established parties. The evidence of ‘cooperation signaling’ is limited to the Czech Republic, where the established party legislation is initiated more swiftly if salient for new parties. The results of this study contribute to the ongoing debate on the consequences of new parties for coalition governance.",

          "authors": "Joel Mendoza Gómez",
          "abstract": "Centralization in federal countries can be explained by the incentives that a party’s selectorate generates for legislators. This paper examines how intra-party institutional structures shape federal decentralization by analyzing how Candidate Selection Decentralization (CSD) affects the vertical allocation of policy authority across 11 federations. Using within-country variation, I find a quadratic relationship between CSD and legislative decentralization. As CSD increases, legislators face Competing Principals Problems (CPP) between national leaders and subnational selectorates, weakening party cohesion. Yet this effect is non-linear: centralized selection fosters cohesion and centralization, while fully decentralized selection also reinforces centralization due to coordination failures. In contrast, intermediate levels of CSD—where subnational elites control nominations—empower state-level actors who promote decentralizing reforms in electorally or fiscally salient policy areas. These findings underscore the institutional role of intra-party rules in shaping the vertical distribution of power in federal systems.",

          "authors": "Marika Landau-Wells, Kirsten O. Lydic, Joachim Kennedy, Benjamin G. Mittman, Todd W. Thompson, Akhil Gupta, Rebecca Saxe",
          "abstract": "Exclusionary social policies take a significant toll on the mental and physical health of targeted groups. Support for specific exclusionary policies does not always align with general antipathy towards the targeted group, however. Does support for specific exclusionary policies rely on particular thought processes (i.e., cognitive mechanisms)? Does opposition? We investigate these questions through the lens of “bathroom laws” across two studies. In Study 1, we use functional neuroimaging to test three candidate cognitive mechanisms from the literature: (1) threat-related emotions (e.g., fear, disgust) supporting exclusionary preferences; (2) mentalizing (e.g., empathy, perspective-taking) supporting inclusionary preferences; and (3) self-regulation (e.g., aligning one’s behavior with one’s goals) supporting inclusionary preferences. Consistent with the intergroup conflict and prejudice literatures, we find evidence of a motivated self-regulation mechanism in bathroom law opponents. In Study 2, we investigate a possible source of this motivation using text analysis of open-ended policy preference justifications. We find that bathroom law opponents link their policy preference to a small number of specific values, particularly autonomy of action. Taken together, these studies point to a value-driven, motivational account of inclusionary preferences that reconciles puzzling patterns of public opinion, offers new levers for tolerance interventions, and provides some insight into the brain-basis of political behavior.",

          "authors": "Joy E. Losee, Gerald D. Higginbotham, Gaby C. Pogge, Liz Kerner, James A. Shepperd",
          "abstract": "The present research examined whether political ideology corresponded with gun attitudes among people disproportionately experiencing gun violence—Black people in the United States. Across four studies ( N = 25,847) we found that race (Black vs. White) interacted with political ideology to predict gun attitudes, safety perceptions, and policy preferences. Among White participants, being more conservative corresponded with more positive gun attitudes, perceptions, and support for pro‐gun policies. Among Black participants, the relationship was weak or nonsignificant. Further, experience with gun violence also interacted with political ideology such that the relationship between gun attitudes, policy preferences and political ideology was weaker among participants who reported experience with gun violence compared with participants that reported no experience. These results have implications for the generalizability of the single‐item political ideology scale. This research also indicates that efforts to reduce gun violence focusing on reducing political polarization overlook that the polarization occurs largely among White people which may ultimately divert attention and resources from Black communities most impacted by gun violence.",

          "abstract": "The assumption that political beliefs are formed by early‐life socialization and psychological predispositions, leading to stability in adulthood, increasingly acts as a theoretical cornerstone in the literature. However, politics is replete with examples of attitudinal change; this article proposes that certain stable psychological predispositions are likely to foster volatility in attitudes and general cognition. Using British electoral panel data, it shows that social distrust, open‐mindedness, and tolerance for uncertainty are associated with greater volatility in attitudes to immigration, redistribution, European integration, environmentalism, capital punishment, and Scottish independence. Locus of control, need‐for‐cognition, empathy, and risk tolerance are associated only with volatility in attitudes to some issues. Age, education, household income, being male, and lower partisanship are all negatively associated with attitudinal volatility. Overall, this study suggests that attitudinal volatility itself constitutes a meaningful dimension of political behavior, rooted in stable psychological predispositions.",

          "abstract": "Using three nationally representative, probability samples of Americans ( N s range from 848 to 20,728), we examined the endorsement of symbolic racism against Black people among both Black and White Americans through the lens of system justification. We found (1) endorsement of symbolic racism among Black Americans is not trivial and (2) acceptance of income inequality is a robust predictor of symbolic racism for all respondents, above and beyond political conservatism, ingroup and outgroup affect (Studies 1 and 3), racial stereotype endorsement (Study 2), desire for social dominance, and group consciousness (Study 3). Furthermore, the association between acceptance of inequality and symbolic racism is mediated by perceptions of system fairness for both Black and White respondents (Study 3). This large‐scale analysis suggested that both Black and White Americans have a motivation to perceive the system as fair, and this manifested in similar justifications of racial inequality, even when such beliefs are antithetical to group or self‐interests.",

          "title": "Do constitutional unamendability rules make a difference?",
          "authors": "Adam Chilton, Mila Versteeg",
          "abstract": "Leaders often try to amend constitutions to remove checks on their powers. To help protect against such democratic erosion, constitutional drafters and jurists sometimes restrict constitutional amendments by: (1) specifying in the constitutional text that certain clauses or principles can never be changed (“Eternity Clauses”); (2) granting apex courts the power to review the procedural validity of amendment processes (“Amendment Review”); or (3) developing judicial doctrines that block amendments that change the constitution’s nature (“Unamendability Doctrines”). But are unamendability rules actually associated with differences in countries’ levels of democracy? We argue that Eternity Clauses are likely to emerge in conditions more conducive to protecting democracy, while court-created doctrines will emerge in conditions when democracy is under threat. We also hypothesize that enforcement is difficult because when would-be autocrats command enough political power to amend their constitution, it is hard for both courts and political actors to resist. We test this argument using data on countries’ unamendability rules and their levels of democracy. Across three research designs—cross-country comparisons, panel regressions, and event studies—we find some evidence that countries that adopt Eternity Clauses subsequently have higher levels of democracy, but this may be due to differences in countries’ democratization trends prior to adopting them. In contrast, we find little evidence that Amendment Review or Unamendability Doctrines are associated with differences in democracy levels. We do find that unamendability rules are associated with higher levels of constitutional replacement, suggesting that when amendments are not possible, undemocratic reforms might be pursued by writing a constitution from scratch. We supplement these quantitative findings with a case study of presidential term limit evasion, which shows that unamendability rules are rarely invoked to halt term limit amendments.",

          "abstract": "Social media has had a transformative effect on politics and governance. While research into the consequences of social media use on politics and governance is mixed, elected officials and political candidates commonly use multiple social media channels to grow constituencies and draw attention to their agenda. A well-crafted social media strategy can further the perception of a candidate or elected official as credible, trustworthy, and able to effectively govern. However, research into social media has suggested that engagement is often driven by toxic and negative content, limiting the possibility of productive political discourse. Using a dataset of posts from 58 U.S. Senate candidates on Twitter, this study seeks to determine whether social media-based political communication during the 2022 election aligns with preexisting perceptions of toxicity. The results suggest that the toxicity of candidates’ Twitter-based political communication is mostly low, though temporal and group differences were found. This case study provides a basis for further investigation into candidates’ strategic use of social media.",

          "abstract": "Often lacking adequate information to guide their votes, voters may be susceptible to subtle psychological influences, including name recognition. For decades, scholars have found that voters are more likely to cast ballots for candidates whose names they recognize. These arguments imply that exposure to little-known candidates’ names increases electoral support. But research has seldom demonstrated a causal effect consistent with this “mere exposure” hypothesis, particularly under real-world conditions. We conduct three sets of experiments exposing subjects to the names of challengers in a range of electoral contexts across the United States. Results yield little support for the hypothesis that exposure increases electoral support. As name recognition may be insufficient without party labels, we also conduct experiments providing the candidates’ party affiliations, again finding little evidence of an effect. These findings cast doubt on the hypothesis that candidates, particularly challengers, who merely make their names known will thereby win more votes.",
