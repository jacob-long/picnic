          "title": "Balancing bossism: State expansion in the face of elite capture",
          "authors": "Anna F. Callis, Christopher L. Carter",
          "abstract": "Central states have often relied on local elites to implement policies in peripheral areas. These strategies may allow otherwise weak states to impose their directives, but they can also be inefficient, particularly when a single elite commands total control over local politics ( monopolist capture ). We argue that weak states can overcome this equilibrium by creating new subnational positions with distinct appointment rules from existing ones ( balancing ). We evaluate our argument leveraging a natural experiment and novel data on 12,000 sub‐municipal units from turn‐of‐the‐twentieth‐century Peru. We exploit as‐if random variation in population‐based appointment rules for a justice of the peace, the chief institution through which monopolist capture was established. We provide evidence that the Peruvian government responded to monopolist capture by creating local‐level executive positions (lieutenant governors). We further demonstrate that this balancing allowed the state to conduct a 1902 education census, which was otherwise opposed and often blocked by entrenched elites.",

          "authors": "Joseph J. Ruggiero",
          "abstract": "War is often viewed as a bargaining problem. However, prior to bargaining, countries can vie for leverage by expending effort on diplomacy. This article presents a dynamic model of conflict where agenda‐setting power is endogenous to pre‐bargaining diplomatic competition. The ability to compete for leverage generates a new channel through which the nature of potential war affects the quality of peace. First, costs of war grow the bargaining surplus, fueling the battle for leverage and reducing welfare even if war never occurs on the path of play. Second, competitive diplomacy erodes the gains from peace, making it possible that war is relatively efficient. An extension of the model finds that frictions to cooperation create a risk of costly delay but also protect against erosion of the surplus. Moreover, I find that reliable deals avert “efficient” wars but introduce a trade‐off between welfare and timely settlement.",

          "authors": "HANNAH E. BAGDANOV",
          "abstract": "In East Jerusalem, the vast majority of Palestinians contest the legitimacy of the Israeli state’s claim to sovereignty. This necessarily affects how Palestinians engage with the state in pursuit of goods and services. But how? Using data from 55 interviews and original observational and experimental survey data from a representative sample of East Jerusalemites, I show that civilians’ engagement with each good, service, and institution of the state is a function of their perceptions of the state’s legitimacy, or right to rule, in that sector. Civilians will avoid engagement with goods, services, and institutions that explicitly affirm the state’s claims to monopolized sovereign rule, without forsaking essential goods and services. This article empirically illustrates that the same individual will make different choices with respect to each state sector, and in doing so builds on the burgeoning recognition of sector-level choices in the citizen claim-making literature.",

          "authors": "Diana Da In Lee, Yamil Ricardo Velez",
          "abstract": "Ethnicity and race are vital for understanding representation, yet individual-level data are often unavailable. Recent methodological advances have allowed researchers to impute racial and ethnic classifications based on publicly available information, but predictions vary in their accuracy and can introduce statistical biases in downstream analyses. We provide an overview of common estimation methods, including Bayesian approaches and machine learning techniques that use names or images as inputs. We propose and test a hybrid approach that combines surname-based Bayesian estimation with the use of publicly available images in a convolutional neural network. We find that the proposed approach not only reduces statistical bias in downstream analyses but also improves accuracy in a sample of over 16,000 local elected officials. We conclude with a discussion of caveats and describe settings where the hybrid approach is especially suitable.",

          "authors": "Nils Blossey",
          "abstract": "Ageing populations and slower growth have compelled governments in mature welfare states to implement fiscal adjustments, but uncertainty persists about whether these measures have successfully curtailed the size of the welfare state. This letter documents that fiscal adjustments reduce social spending more effectively than previously thought. Using data from sixteen advanced economies between 1978 and 2018 and the narrative identification of adjustment plans, I estimate cumulative multipliers with local projections. I find that fiscal adjustments persistently lower social spending, including key components of social consumption and social investment. To explain why austerity does not shelter the welfare state, I present stylized facts about the timing and composition of adjustment plans. First, while public investment cuts concentrate at the beginning of the adjustment period, social consumption cuts accumulate over time. Second, large budget deficits and financial crises are frequent antecedents of the most ambitious fiscal reforms.",

          "authors": "Simon Chauchard, Sumitra Badrinathan",
          "abstract": "Misinformation has emerged as a key threat worldwide, with scholars frequently highlighting the role of partisan motivated reasoning in misinformation belief. Yet the mechanisms enabling the endorsement of misinformation may differ in contexts where other identities are salient. This study explores whether religion drives the endorsement of misinformation in India. Using original data, we first show that individuals with high levels of religiosity and religious polarization endorse significantly higher levels of misinformation. Next, to understand the causal mechanisms through which religion operates, we field an experiment where corrections rely on religious messaging, and/or manipulate perceptions of religious ingroup identity. We find that corrections including religious frames (1) reduce the endorsement of misinformation; (2) are sometimes more effective than standard corrections; and (3) work beyond the specific story corrected. These findings highlight the religious roots of belief formation and provide hope that social identities can be marshalled to counter misinformation.",

          "abstract": "As extreme political views gain popularity and acceptability, the conditions under which media exposure to extreme right views contributes to this process, and strategies to counter media-induced persuasion and normalisation effects remain unclear. Using population-based survey experiments leveraging real-world interviews with extreme right activists on Sky News UK and Australia, we test whether media exposure leads to higher agreement with extreme right statements. We also test whether exposure affects perceptions of how many others agree with these statements. Our findings are consistent across both countries: exposure to uncritical interviews increases agreement with extreme statements and perceptions of broader support in the population. Testing the media strategy in the UK, we find that critical interviewing tarnishes the activist’s image and reduces effects, but still heightens perceived support for extreme statements. This study identifies a mechanism through which extreme political ideas spread and offers insights into media strategies to counteract persuasion and normalisation effects.",

          "title": "Venturing Beyond the Vote: Routes to Feeling Represented through Unelected Representation",
          "authors": "Andrea Vik, Pieter de Wilde, Oliver Treib, Lene Aarøe",
          "abstract": "This study examines how unelected representation, where political activists make representative claims on behalf of self-articulated constituencies, shapes citizens’ feelings of representation. Through a cross-national conjoint experiment (Sweden, Germany, Italy, and Romania, N = 8279), we test three routes to representation : descriptive representation through demographic congruence, substantive representation through issue congruence, and psychological representation through personality-trait congruence and personality-ideology congruence. Results indicate that unelected representation makes people feel represented through these routes. Substantive representation has the strongest impact, followed by psychological representation and descriptive representation. We also find that contextual and individual factors influence how these routes operate. Ultimately, this paper presents a novel perspective on the effects of unelected representation, laying the groundwork for new empirical models of political representation that are firmly rooted in the conceptual innovations of constructivist theories. Unelected representation may have important implications for modern representative politics.",

          "abstract": "Corrupt politicians are expected to be held accountable when they are caught doing wrong, but does prosecuting politicians affect their co-partisans? I leverage variation in criminal corruption charges among Mexican governors after the legislative elections of 2015 to identify their consequences on votes received by legislators in 2018. I find a robust association: legislative candidates in districts of criminal governors received between 3 and 6% less votes than candidates in districts with no criminal governors. These findings suggest that criminal trials affect parties even in places where corruption is pervasive and trust in the judicial process is extremely low. This electoral punishment of co-partisans, which I call ‘guilt by association,’ helps the role that criminalization of corruption can play in enforcing vertical accountability.",

          "authors": "Ka Ming Chan",
          "abstract": "Authoritarians’ electoral victories often catch worldwide attention as they are detrimental to global democracy. But despite the salience of their victories, we know little about whether these events abroad change citizens’ satisfaction with democracy (SWD). Building on the transnational learning literature, this research tests two diverging effects regarding the spillover of an authoritarian’s electoral victory. Citizens may be less satisfied with domestic democracy (contagion/domino effect) or see their democracy in a rosier light (benchmark effect). Additionally, because of motivated reasoning, such effects may be heterogeneous among citizens with different ideologies. To test for these expectations, I re-analyse two datasets collected in Europe amid the 2016 US presidential election. Both studies demonstrate a modest benchmark effect, as citizens’ SWD increases after Trump’s unexpected victory. Also, the heterogeneity analysis finds that the benchmark effect is most prominent among citizens who previously voted for socialist/radical left parties or liberal parties. I discuss how these findings enrich the literature on autocratization, transnational learning and satisfaction with democracy.",

          "authors": "Ennio E. Piano, Louis C. Rouanet",
          "abstract": "This paper explores the constitutional history of American Indian tribes since the 1930s. We compile a novel data set on 1,016 constitutional change episodes by 290 tribes. We leverage this information to explore the determinants of variation in tribal constitutional change over time and across tribes. First, we show that the location of tribes influences their propensity to amend, with tribes from the Great Plains and Eastern regions doing so at much higher rates than the rest. We then investigate the influence of changes in federal attitudes towards tribal sovereignty. Our analysis unveils a relationship between a tribe’s demographic and political characteristics on the one hand and its propensity to amend and constitutional longevity on the other. We show that membership size (in 1926) and whether a tribe adopts directly democratic forms of governance positively affects how much and how often it amends its constitution. We also find a surprising positive association between constitutional rigidity and the number and rate at which tribes amend. Our results confirm the influence of federal Indian policy on the trajectory of American Indian sovereignty. Changes in federal Indian policy significantly affect tribes’ choice to amend their constitutions, with the number of amendments per tribe per year doubling during the so-called ‘Self-Determination’ period (1968–1988).",
