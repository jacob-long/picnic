          "authors": "Allan Hsiao, Nicholas Kuipers",
          "abstract": "We surveyed voters and politicians in advance of the 2024 Indonesian election to measure preferences for environmental policy. We find that politicians underestimate voter concerns. We conducted an informational experiment with politicians to correct these misperceptions, and we document evidence of learning but no greater support for policy action. We explore three explanations for why voter preferences do not translate into policy. First, politicians only consider acting when their initial misperceptions are particularly large. Second, elite capture prevents politicians from implementing environmental protection. Third, voters prioritize progress in other domains. Our results underscore the multiplicity of challenges facing climate action.",

          "authors": "Harry Oppenheimer",
          "abstract": "This paper presents the first empirical analysis demonstrating how international security influences global data flows. Firms exchange data traffic to achieve fast, stable, and affordable access to digital infrastructure, driving digital interdependence. While international security shapes economic interdependence, the mechanisms linking the two – sanctions, tariffs, boycotts, and contracts – create little risk for Internet interconnection, which is commonly exempted from sanction and tariff regimes, not directly consumed by the public, and not enabled through traditional contracts. I theorize that international conflict generates cybersecurity externalities as state and non-state actors directly weaponize digital interdependence. Firms and their networks sit directly in the path of future conflicts. Leveraging network topographical measurements from computer engineering, I test whether conflict expectations increase states’ mutual reliance to move data. I find robust evidence that power politics shapes digital interdependence and use additional analyses to argue that externalities, rather than state preferences, drive this process.",

          "abstract": "Many countries struggle to heal the wounds caused by past governmental discrimination against minorities, a process sometimes made difficult by continuing instances of injustice. One tool to improve majority-minority relations is Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (TRCs), which document historical injustices. We collect data before and after the release of the Norwegian TRC report on the treatment of the Sámi and other national minorities, which allows us to investigate its effects on reconciliatory attitudes. We further leverage the unrelated outbreak of demonstrations against current injustices, allowing us to examine responses to both past and current injustices. We find greater support for some aspects of reconciliation, but mainly in areas with a small presence of national minorities. Our results show the limits of TRCs when current conflicts shape the interpretation of historical injustice.",

          "authors": "Christoph Valentin Steinert, Hannah Marietta Smidt",
          "abstract": "What are the repressive consequences of civil society participation in international human rights complaints mechanisms? Such mechanisms allow civil society actors to make governments’ human rights violations known to international organizations. International organizations can respond by ‘naming and shaming’ states. We expect that complaint-based shaming increases repression against civil society organizations (CSOs). In particular, governments exploit the specific and personalized information contained in complaint-based shaming to repress challengers and deter future complaints. We test our theory with three studies – (i) a cross-national analysis, (ii) a CSO-level analysis with original survey data, and (iii) a media-based analysis – using multiple identification strategies, including instrumental variables. Our evidence shows that shaming in response to complaints has detrimental effects for CSOs in both democracies and autocracies. Our findings highlight that personalized shaming creates the risk of targeted reprisals and call for reforms that take this risk more seriously.",

          "authors": "David Weisstanner, Sarah Engler",
          "abstract": "This letter investigates the electoral effects of symbolic class signalling through ‘cultural consumption’ in contemporary politics. We explore how politicians referring to an activity related to class-specific ‘cultural consumption’ – drinking beer in a pub or listening to classical music with a glass of wine – appeals to voters. We argue that symbolic class signalling has gained in importance due to the political realignment along the cultural dimension, and we expect radical right parties to benefit most from it. Our conjoint survey experiment with 1,550 respondents in Switzerland in January/February 2023 confirms our expectation. While many voters are biased against politicians claiming to enjoy classical music and wine, politicians drinking beer in a pub appeal particularly to radical right working-class voters without tertiary education. These findings contribute to our understanding of the role of symbolic politics and class identity in times of political transformation.",

          "abstract": "How are experiences from socialist rule reflected in support for the former regime and ideological stances after democratization? This study examines how varied experiences under socialism—whether as regime supporters or victims of repression—continue to be linked to political behavior decades after transition. Using three decades of intergenerational panel data from the former German Democratic Republic, the findings show that repression is associated with long-term opposition to the regime’s successor party, Die Linke, while former party membership corresponds with lasting support. These experiences also relate to ideological self-placement, with distinct left-right patterns persisting based on past affiliations. Within families, the extent to which these political legacies are passed down depends on political interest, highlighting that they are not uniformly inherited. By exploring how socialist-era experiences remain embedded in post-transition political attitudes, this study underscores the role of historical experiences in shaping political behavior in new democracies.",

          "authors": "Richard Reid, Carolyn M Hendriks, Anika Gauja",
          "abstract": "Political parties as the sole vehicle for collective organising in the electoral arena are coming under increasing pressure in systems of representative democracy. A serious disruptor to party dominance has emerged in Australia where local community groups are self-organising to replace their federal party representative with a ‘community independent’. Collectively these groups are referred to as the “Community Independents Movement” (CIM), whose broad goal is to provide voters with an alternative to the “broken” party system. This article asks: what in practice is the alternative form of political organising offered by the CIM? An analysis finds that the CIM performs many conventional functions of political parties, but its localised approach affords greater flexibility and local autonomy. The case of the CIM speaks to global debates on the conceptual and functional differences between parties and other modes of political organising.",

          "authors": "Carla Grosche, Tobias Rothmund",
          "abstract": "The return to “old glories” is one of the main promises of radical‐right parties, picking up on widespread longings for the collective past. Many people argue that radical‐right support is motivated by Relative Deprivation, that is, the perception of being worse off than others. We suggest that radical‐right support is more likely to reflect Nostalgic Deprivation —the perception of an unfair decline ingroup status compared to the past. However, psychological theorizing is rare, and previous studies differ in their conceptualization and measurement. We seek to fill this gap by introducing and validating a standardized measure of nostalgic deprivation. Based on a literature review, we start with a concise definition and conceptualization of nostalgic deprivation. We developed a reliable nine‐item self‐report scale that captures nostalgic deprivation indicated by (a) a temporal disadvantage comparison, (b) injustice appraisal, and (c) collective anger and nostalgia ( N = 398). We estimated the reliability and validity using empirical indicators of demographics, right‐wing populist attitudes, voting and personality measures in German ( N = 1206) and US‐quota samples ( N = 490). Our data shed light on the great predictive power of nostalgic deprivation for radical‐right support surpassing established measures of relative deprivation and nostalgia.",

          "authors": "Marlene Mußotter, Eunike Piwoni",
          "abstract": "Whilst survey research on national attachments has used various measures, the question of how respondents understand these measures, and especially the highly ambiguous concepts they entail, has remained understudied. Moreover, scholars have used samples consisting of “citizens”, thereby not distinguishing between citizens with and citizens without a migrant background. Drawing on qualitative evidence from six focus group discussions in Germany in 2023, we seek to contribute to filling this research gap and investigate the understanding of selected measures of national attachments and the terms they entail from the perspective of Germans with and without migrant backgrounds. In so doing, we explore the meaning of three concepts – namely, “true German” ( wahrer Deutscher ), “German people” ( deutsches Volk ), and “fatherland” ( Vaterland ). Our discussions indicate differences between these groups and show, among other things, that the understanding of Germans with a migrant background tends to be driven by an ethnic and ethnocultural notion of nationhood, while the understanding of those without a migrant background often has a more civic notion. Moreover, the latter were more likely to question the three terms than the former. Overall, our study calls for refining extant measures to ensure they do justice to an increasingly multicultural society.",

          "authors": "Semra Sevi, Donald P. Green",
          "abstract": "Although much has been written on legislative reciprocity, rarely have scholars had an opportunity to leverage a randomly assigned asset to assess whether and how legislators reciprocate when their colleagues assist them. Using the lottery that allows Canadian Members of Parliament (MPs) to propose bills or motions, we examine whether MPs’ priority numbers affect their proclivity to second motions made by other MPs, which would be expected if MPs sought to build support for their own proposals by supporting proposals by others. Although MPs almost always make a proposal if their priority number allows them to do so, we find a weak relationship between MPs’ priority numbers and their probability of seconding others’ proposals. Moreover, when we look at successive parliaments, we see only faint indications that those who, by chance, won the right to propose in the previous session (and who therefore were eligible to attract seconds) are more likely to second others’ proposals in the current session. Although subject to a fair amount of statistical uncertainty that will gradually dissipate as future parliaments are examined, this pattern of evidence currently suggests that correlated seconding behavior among legislators is more the product of homophily than reciprocity.",

          "abstract": "This paper studies voter turnout and selective abstention on voting days with more than one election or referendum. We extend the rational choice model to a setting with multiple concurrent votes. The model is based on a voter’s net benefit, which includes a vote’s salience and information costs. It explains how the net benefit of different concurrent votes enters a voter’s utility function and thereby affects turnout and selective abstention, the tendency to vote in one but not all votes held on the same day. We test our theoretical predictions using data on concurrent propositions in Switzerland from 1988 to 2016. Our results suggest that the proposition with the highest net benefit and the sum of the net benefits of all concurrent propositions are relevant determinants of the individual turnout decision. We also find that a proposition’s net benefit explains variation in selective abstention.",

          "authors": "Marnie Howlett, Lauren C. Konken",
          "abstract": "The “home–field” dichotomy has long been a core assumption of fieldwork in political science. As in other social science disciplines, political scientists rely on these categories to contextualize our research within particular time–space nexuses and to separate our personal lives and private dwellings and institutions from our sources, participants, and broader research environments. Although the spatial, temporal, and emotional divisions between our “homes” and “fields” have always been arbitrary, they are increasingly blurred when we use remote and online methods for research, especially for qualitative studies. This article problematizes the home–field dichotomy within the context of remote and online political science field research. We contend that the overlap of our homes and fields in digital fieldwork poses different challenges for our professional boundaries than offline research, particularly in terms of separating our personal and research lives, mitigating risk, and protecting our mental health. Given the growing use of remote and online methods, we argue that the discipline of political science must account more seriously for the muddling of our homes and fields to support rigorous, transparent, and ethical empirical research.",

          "authors": "Ricardo R. Noé",
          "abstract": "How do political leaders in states with limited institutional constraints enforce property rights? In 20th-century Guatemala, German coffee producers benefited from the country’s export-led growth policies—trade agreements, land grants, and infrastructure concessions that allowed them to become the primary producers of the country’s coffee. The security of their property rights depended on their contributions to government revenue through the production of coffee and customs duties. When contributions declined during both world wars, so did security of ownership, leading to two bouts of large-scale expropriation—during the dictatorships of Manuel Estrada (1898–1920) and Jorge Ubico (1931–44). Through a comparative analysis of the two regimes that draws from original qualitative and quantitative evidence, this article argues that political leaders limit expropriation to encourage production and maximize government revenue. However, when revenue falls below the expected gains from expropriation, the likelihood of state appropriation of property rights—whether through asset seizure or regulatory restrictions—increases.",
