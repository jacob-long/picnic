          "title": "Complementarity in alliances: How strategic compatibility and hierarchy promote efficient cooperation in international security",
          "authors": "J. Andrés Gannon",
          "abstract": "How can defense alliances reap the efficiency gains of working together when coordination and opportunism costs are high? Although specializing as part of a collective comes with economic and functional benefits, states must bargain over the distribution of those gains and ensure the costs of collective action are minimized. I argue that states can overcome these problems by forming alliances with high strategic compatibility and hierarchy. This approach minimizes opportunism and coordination costs by efficiently distributing defense capabilities, encouraging complementarity rather than redundancy. I demonstrate this by developing a novel network‐level measure of division of labor and applying it to data on national military capabilities from 1970 to 2014. This research not only enhances understanding of the modern international system but also underscores the importance of these considerations for intra‐alliance bargaining more broadly.",

          "authors": "Hao Zhang",
          "abstract": "Global value chains (GVCs) have connected firms in complex networks within and across national borders. However, political economy models often assume away production linkages and thus fail to explain pervasive and diverse trade coalitions cutting across industries and firms. I develop a GVC‐centered framework where production linkages through a common foreign partner foster interdependent preferences and collective action for trade liberalization. For empirical tests, I compile firm‐to‐firm supply chain networks, construct direct measures, and estimate various network models. I find that US firms with GVC linkages tend to lobby together, lobby on the same bill, and hire the same lobbyist. Furthermore, GVC linkages among lead firms increase collective lobbying through trade associations. Finally, I show that GVC linkages predict the formation and depth of preferential trade networks. These results provide microfoundations for new coalitional politics under GVCs and challenge the common assumption about industries and firms as isolated political actors.",

          "title": "The political consequences of Africa's mobile revolution",
          "authors": "Alex Yeandle",
          "abstract": "What are the political consequences of rising domestic connectivity? I study this question in Sub‐Saharan Africa, asking how mobile technology shapes public opinion in geographically isolated communities. For remote rural populations, mobile devices increase contact with physically distant social networks, through regular phone calls with urban relatives. These interactions provide personalized information about the economic challenges of city life, which reduce rural trust in government. I offer continent‐wide evidence of this effect, leveraging geocoded survey data and the expansion of mobile coverage across Africa in a difference‐in‐differences setting. I then use a household panel, an original survey, and focus group discussions from Ghana to shed light on mechanisms. The paper advances literature on social networks, migration, and technological change, painting a nuanced picture of Africa's mobile revolution and its multifaceted political effects.",

          "authors": "Daniel Gibbs",
          "abstract": "I study a political agency model where a reelection‐seeking politician chooses when to make policy and a voter learns about the politician's competence from its timing, substance, and outcome. It takes time for the politician to receive information about which policy is in the voter's best interest and for the effect of policy to be observed. Due to perverse electoral incentives, politicians engage in three behaviors that limit electoral accountability. First, politicians hedge by delaying policy to hide potential policy failure from voters. Second, politicians pander late in the electoral cycle where they cannot credibly campaign on the success of an unpopular policy. Third, in the hope of producing visible policy success, politicians gamble by making a prompt policy choice when it is in the voter's best interest to delay. I show how politicians use these behaviors strategically in response to different contingencies and study their implications for electoral accountability.",

          "abstract": "While scholars document associations between competing parties’ policy disputes and citizens’ cross-party hostility, that is, affective polarization, we lack causal comparative evidence of how different types of ideological disagreements shape partisan affective evaluations. We investigate this issue with a priming experiment across ten Western publics, which prompts some respondents to answer questions inviting them to discuss debates over either cultural or economic issues versus a control group that receives a non-political prompt. Respondents in the economic and cultural priming conditions expressed greater distrust of out-partisans, and, among respondents who received cultural priming, those who discussed immigration in their open-ended responses expressed far more distrust towards opponents – an effect driven by right-wing respondents who discussed immigration. These findings provide comparative evidence that economic and cultural debates cause affective polarization, with immigration as a primary cultural driver.",

          "authors": "Aníbal Pérez-Liñán, Scott Mainwaring",
          "abstract": "This paper advances the study of democratic trajectories – whether democracies deepen, stagnate, erode or break down over time. We show that econometric panel models usually neglect cumulative effects, which are implicitly central to many theories of democratic change. Some important factors, such as economic growth, have cumulative effects that shape medium- to long-term regime trajectories. To overcome the limitations of conventional statistical estimators, we propose the use of latent growth curve models, which are better able to capture cumulative processes. We demonstrate the advantages of this approach by analyzing the trajectory of 103 democratic regimes inaugurated after 1974. Conventional estimators fail to predict democratic trajectories, while latent growth curve models properly capture cumulative effects.",

          "abstract": "Can communicative interventions by the government influence political trust and increase public compliance during crises? This study examines the impact of a televised speech by German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic. Using an unexpected‐events‐during‐survey‐design, we find that the speech led to a 7‐percentage point increase in trust in the federal government and up to a 25‐percentage point decrease in citizens' mobility. We also observe demographic variation in susceptibility to speech. We explore the underlying mechanisms by comparing Merkel's speech with similar televised addresses by Mark Rutte and Boris Johnson, where we observe no comparable effects on attitudes. We suggest that specific content, such as an emphasis on solidarity and positive sentiment, may have played a role in mobilizing public support. Our findings indicate that effective leader communication can be a powerful tool for sustaining public support and ensuring compliance with crisis measures.",

          "abstract": "Our paper investigates the drivers of party digitalisation, measuring the influence of environmental factors, inter-party competition and party characteristics on the utilisation of digital tools. The main innovation of this paper is to propose a measurement of digitalisation that classifies digital processes according to their functions and goals: an internal dimension oriented towards participation and members’ engagement, and an external dimension focused on communication and campaigning. Data has been extracted from the DIGIPART database on parties’ digital procedures by Meloni et al. (2024). Our findings highlight the importance of parties’ organisational and ideological features in explaining their internal digitalisation, but not the external. In terms of participation, bigger parties tend to implement more initiatives for online participation, while right-wing parties are less prone to digitalise their internal structures. These effects are reinforced by competition between rivals and contagion processes, which exert positive influence both at the internal and external levels.",

          "authors": "Lukas Rudolph, Franziska Quoß, Thomas Bernauer",
          "abstract": "Supplying society-wide public goods often depends on site-specific provision. Yet, (perceived) localized provision costs may at times outweigh localized individual benefits and thus lead to “not-in-my-backyard” (NIMBY-)opposition (e.g., when trying to set up energy, transportation, social, or, in our case, communication infrastructure). Accurate estimation of the level of NIMBY-opposition per se is analytically challenging because general attitudes towards provision and NIMBY-motivated opposition are intertwined but need to be distinguished and because site selection can be endogenous to local support/opposition. We conducted an experiment that addresses these challenges, focusing on public attitudes toward 5G antenna placement in Switzerland. Using original data from a population-representative sample of Swiss residents ( $$N=5,035$$ ), we observe a population split on the question of 5G network expansion. We survey-experimentally revealed actual 5G antenna locations around respondent homes to a sample largely unaware of these locations beforehand. This information increased individuals’ worry over proximity to antenna sites and reduced support for 5G rollout, with such effects becoming stronger with closer proximity. Differentiating respondents with ex ante higher perceived costs/lower perceived benefits and lower costs/higher benefits from provision, the former are more opposed to 5G rollout, regardless of distance. In contrast, the latter exhibit particularly pronounced NIMBY attitudes. This allows for unexpected political coalitions that, in our case, could affect majority support. In additional experiments, we show that NIMBY attitudes translate into a higher willingness to pay for opposition in close proximity to new provision sites—but this could potentially be mitigated by scenarios where citizens decide under a veil of ignorance.",

          "title": "Hatred Takes An Ideologue: Recognizable Belief Patterns Lead to More Animosity and Disagreement",
          "authors": "Tadeas Cely",
          "abstract": "An expanding body of evidence indicates that substantive disagreement fuels political animosity. However, pundits often use terms like ’ideological disagreement’ to describe a broad range of phenomena, diverging from how the concept is understood in classical Conversian literature on beliefs and their structures. This literature suggests that individuals do not uniformly hold or organize their opinions. Building on this foundation, I argue for a critical distinction between disagreements among ideologues—who are opinionated and aligned in their beliefs—and disagreements among others. I hypothesize that disagreements among ideologues result in higher expected disagreement and greater mutual animosity. To test this hypothesis, I conducted two survey experiments with representative U.S. samples (N = 2,000 each, in January 2024 and May 2024). Using evaluations of hypothetical profiles of fellow citizens, I demonstrate that opinionatedness and ideological alignment of beliefs significantly reduce interpersonal affinity in contexts of disagreement. In the first study, disagreements with centrists elicit nearly four times less animosity than disagreements with opinionated counterparts. Furthermore, ideological alignment generates almost three times more intense feelings at equivalent levels of substantive (dis)agreement. In the second study, I find that ideologically aligned individuals anticipate higher levels of disagreement with one another compared to non-ideologues, when they observe the same level of disagreement as them. This effect is particularly pronounced among ideologues capable of recognizing ideological patterns in others’ beliefs. These findings highlight the role of opinionatedness and recognizable belief structures, offering a new approach that is generalizable to other divided democracies.",

          "authors": "Xiaobin Lou, Liman Man Wai Li, Kenichi Ito",
          "abstract": "People grapple with the reality that their individual actions are too insignificant to impact climate change—a phenomenon known as personal climate response inefficacy. The compensatory control theory articulates that people may turn to overarching social institutions or ideologies (e.g., conservatism) when they lack personal control. Inspired by this theory, the present research explored whether individuals experiencing personal climate response inefficacy are more likely to embrace political conservatism. Study 1 analyzed data from the European Social Survey ( N = 44,387) and provided preliminary evidence of a positive association between personal climate response inefficacy and political conservatism. Study 2 utilized four‐wave longitudinal data from 1008 American participants and identified a consistent within‐person cross‐lagged effect, where personal climate response inefficacy predicted increased political conservatism over time. Both studies ruled out the potential conflating effect of the perceived threat of climate change. Study 3 collected cross‐sectional data from 270 Americans and replicated the major findings while controlling for the potential confounding effect of general self‐efficacy. Study 4 ( N = 261) manipulated personal climate response inefficacy yet only provided partial supportive evidence for our main findings. These pieces of evidence suggest that psychological processes specific to climate change can have spillover effects on other domains.",

          "abstract": "The centrality of information and communicative processes in influencing and contributing to the beliefs held in a populous has, historically, made the media one of the key networks of power and influence in society. The rapid expansion of social media platforms has revolutionized how media power is wielded to influence how political, economic, and social issues are mobilized, understood, and addressed. Understanding how this process occurs is, thus, important, but methods for achieving this understanding continue to evolve. This article draws on a large corpus of material (2473 Tweets and associated metadata) produced by the Russian state media Twitter account, @RT_Com, as one part of a broader campaign to influence the Western response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. We identified five overarching narratives that @RT_Com developed to influence its target audience: No Russian invasion; the West is threatening Russian security; Ukraine is part of Russia; Russia will utilize nuclear weapons to protect its sovereignty; and economic, political, and social insecurity in the West. Drawing on Aristotle's rhetorical framework, this article presents a process analysis to understand how these narratives were developed into means of persuasion. The findings provide new insights into the processes of persuasion in contemporary society.",

          "authors": "Alberto Stefanelli, Bruno Castanho Silva",
          "abstract": "With both affective polarization and populism on the rise in several countries, many have proposed a link between the two phenomena. Yet, research offers little direct evidence on whether populist individuals are more polarized than their mainstream conunterparts. This paper aims to fill this gap by using data from 37 elections in 31 countries to provide a comparative account of the relationship between populism and affective polarization at the individual level. Contrary to common assumptions, resuts show no significant difference in affective polarization between more and less populist individuals. Instead, we identify a curvilinear relationship wherein both individauls who strongly endorse or reject populist ideas exhibit high levels of polarization, with substantial variations across countries. Furthermore, we find that populism is associated with a general disdain for all political parties rather than just rival parties. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that populism is asymmetrically associated with affective polarization. We also provide evidence that ideological extremism, rather than populism, is more consistently and strongly associated with affective polarization in a large number of advanced democracies.",

          "abstract": "In the past five years, 13 counties in Eastern Oregon have voted in nonbinding referendums to separate from the liberal state of Oregon to join the conservative state of Idaho. Drawing on theories of secessionism and irredentism, this article examines the drivers of the so-called Greater Idaho movement by administering a survey in these separatist counties. Our findings indicate that economic discontent and a strong regional identity are more important than fears or partisanship in determining support for moving the interstate border. Our study suggests that more inclusive governance may help to overcome ideological polarization in this case and offers insights into how political divisions may be managed to prevent separatist violence in the United States more generally. We conclude that political minorities need to believe that they have a voice in the system so that they do not mobilize for exit.",

          "abstract": "During the 2020 presidential election, the Trump campaign incorrectly claimed that a lower-than-expected proportion of Republican votes among populations living on and near military bases signaled evidence of voter fraud. These claims rested on assumptions that military bases and their surrounding communities are strongholds for political conservativism––a belief held by scholars, pundits, and politicians alike. While the logic behind these arguments is appealing, it fails to consider the complexities surrounding military service and institutions, political geography, partisan preferences, and voting behavior. We directly test the notion that communities close to military bases will be and vote more Republican. Using three different but related empirical strategies that rely on a large dataset spanning 16 years, we find evidence contradicting the conventional wisdom. No consistent pattern across military installations exists. While some lean Republican, others lean Democratic, and the vast majority exhibit no party pattern at all. Our results carry implications for American civil–military relations and the maintenance of American democracy.",

          "abstract": "Does descriptive representation lead people to evaluate elected officials and their institutions more favorably? Does it improve political efficacy and engagement? We report findings from a survey experiment that uses treatments drawn from respondents’ real political context—elected officials who make policy in respondents’ county of residence. Specifically, we present a sample of Cook County residents with a member of the Cook County Board of Commissioners—who may or may not “match” the respondents gender or ethnoracial identity—to assess whether signaling that the respondent is “descriptively represented” on the Board affects their assessments of the Board and other attitudinal outcomes. Our pre-registered design positions us to identify effects of roughly one-eighth of a standard deviation in our full sample, but the estimated effects of signals of ethnoracial- and gender-based descriptive representation are null across the five outcomes we consider. In pre-registered exploratory analysis re-estimating effects by subgroup, we find evidence that suggests that descriptive representation affects some attitudes among women and Black respondents. This said, the effects we find in these groups are modest in magnitude, scattered, and, in most cases, statistically indistinguishable from those that emerge in other groups.",

          "abstract": "Prominent recent works have measured democratic support using a single latent variable that purports to span a single dimension from steadfast opposition to whole-hearted support. This ignores ample evidence that support for democracy is complex and multidimensional. Here we provide a series of validation tests of the sort of cross-national time-series latent variable measures employed in recent research by reference to questions on support for liberal democracy and opposition to its erosion from multi-wave surveys conducted around the world. These tests show that, across countries and years, this latent variable is nearly orthogonal to measures of support for contestation and participation; civil liberties; institutional constraints on executive power; and prioritizing democracy over the economy, economic equality, or order. We conclude that support for democracy in any robust sense is simply not well captured by one-dimensional latent variable. Such measures are powerful but researchers must be mindful of their limitations.",

          "authors": "Jane Green, Zack Grant, Geoffrey Evans, Gaetano Inglese",
          "abstract": "The rapid expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the workplace has significant political implications. How can we understand perceptions of both personal job risks and opportunities, given each may affect political attitudes differently? We use an original, representative survey from Great Britain to reveal; (i) the degree to which people expect personal AI-based occupational risks versus opportunities, (ii) how much this perceived exposure corresponds to variation in existing expert-derived occupational AI-exposure measures; (iii) the social groups who expect to be AI winners and AI losers; and (iv) how personal AI expectations are associated with demand for different political policies. We find that over 1-in-3 British workers anticipate being an AI winner (10%) or loser (24%) and, while expectations correlate with classifications of occupational exposure, factors like education, gender, age, and employment sector also matter. Politically, both self-anticipated AI winners and losers show similar support for redistribution, but they differ on investment in education and training as well as on immigration. Our findings emphasise the importance of considering subjective winners and losers of AI; these patterns cannot be explained by existing occupational classifications of AI exposure.",

          "title": "Activist disciplines: Universities in autocracies and political protest",
          "authors": "Nils B Weidmann, Mina Rulis",
          "abstract": "Recent events on university campuses show again that academic institutions often constitute breeding grounds for political mobilization. This also applies to autocratic countries, where political protest has been found to be more likely to occur in university cities. However, research so far has failed to address the question of which universities are more likely to see protest. In this paper, we focus on the disciplinary composition of universities in autocracies. We argue that non-STEM disciplines traditionally attract more progressive students, cover more politically sensitive topics, and oftentimes study the determinants of successful mobilization. Therefore, they should be more likely to serve as focal points for political protest. We test our expectations in a large-scale comparative analysis, using fine-grained data on the composition and location of academic institutions in autocracies combined with event data on political protest. We find that political activism is more likely in cities with institutions focused on arts and humanities, which points to the potentially transformative role of these disciplines even in severely constrained political settings.",
