          "title": "Why parties can benefit from promoting occupational diversity in legislatures: Experimental evidence from three countries",
          "authors": "Mia Costa, Miguel M. Pereira",
          "abstract": "How do legislators' occupational backgrounds shape their ability to advance policy? We argue that politicians with professional experience are perceived as more credible in their areas of expertise and can more effectively persuade voters and peers. We examine this argument in a series of experiments in three Western democracies. We find that German legislators with occupational experience in education are more effective at persuading voters in that policy area. The same pattern holds for United States' legislators with experience in healthcare. The quality of the arguments does not substitute for having actual occupational experience. These effects extend to elected officials: Swedish politicians are more likely to co‐sign motions proposed by peers with relevant expertise. Overall, parties that foster occupational diversity are better equipped to build support for their policy agendas. The study uncovers a new mechanism through which descriptive representation can influence policy outcomes, independent of legislators' preferences.",

          "title": "White Democrats’ Growing Support for Black Politicians in the Era of the “Great Awokening”",
          "authors": "ANNA CAROLINE MIKKELBORG",
          "abstract": "Equitable representation of minority groups is a challenge for democratic government. One way to resolve this dilemma is for majority-group voters to support minority-group candidates, but this support is often elusive. To understand how such inter-group coalitions become possible, this paper investigates the case of white Democratic Americans’ growing support for Black political candidates. I show that as white Democrats’ racial attitudes have liberalized, an increasing number of majority-white districts have elected Black congressional representatives. White Democratic survey respondents have also come to prefer Black candidate profiles, as demonstrated in a meta-analysis of 42 experiments. White Democratic respondents in a series of original conjoint experiments were most likely to prefer Black profiles when they expressed awareness of racial discrimination, low racial resentment, and dislike towards Trump. Additional tests underscore the association between majority-group voters’ concern about racial injustice and their support for minority-group candidates.",

          "authors": "Tiffany D. Barnes, Diana Z. O'Brien",
          "abstract": "Gender influences who has access to power, how leaders behave and are received within institutions, and how institutions are perceived. This review examines gender dynamics in the executive branch, focusing on presidents and prime ministers and their cabinets. We analyze four key areas: access to power, policy priorities, gendered leadership styles, and citizens’ responses. We argue that, despite progress, women remain underrepresented in executive roles, especially as chief executives. Women sometimes bring unique policy interests and leadership styles to the office, but strategic career incentives and institutional constraints shape both men's and women's behavior as leaders. Finally, women's presence in executive positions sends signals about the government, as well as about who is fit to govern and participate in politics. In sum, this review highlights the importance of understanding and addressing these gendered dynamics to move closer to gender equality in the highest levels of political leadership.",

          "abstract": "We identify women’s revealed preferences for legislative proposals to investigate substantive representation of women. We then examine whether female or male politicians in parliament are more responsive to revealed female preferences using data on 47,527 decisions made by all 777 Swiss parliamentarians between 1996 and 2022. Holding party and constituent preferences constant, our results show differences in the substantive representation of women between female and male politicians for legislative proposals related to social policies. For all policies unrelated to social issues, we find that female politicians are no more responsive to female preferences than male politicians. Heterogeneity analyses show that differences in the substantive representation of women by male and female politicians on social policy issues do not depend on the socialization of the politicians, or the underlying political incentives and constraints.",

          "authors": "Frank Wyer",
          "abstract": "How do episodes of post-conflict violence affect public support for peace? I argue that political messaging about who or what is to blame can influence how violence affects attitudes towards peace agreements. I test this argument in Colombia, a country which has experienced violence after a 2016 peace agreement, and where rival political camps debate whether government failures or noncompliance by rebels is to blame. In an experiment with 1466 respondents in conflict and non-conflict zones, I paired news about post-conflict violence with information supporting these competing messages. I find that emphasizing rebel culpability reduced support for peace agreements, but emphasizing poor government implementation did not have a strong countervailing effect. A probe of the mechanisms suggests that while emphasizing rebel culpability increased perceptions that rebels alone were to blame, emphasizing government implementation failures led respondents to conclude that both parties were to blame, limiting the effectiveness of this message.",

          "abstract": "Federal systems have centralized at a rapid pace since the second half of the twentieth century. Subnational legislatures tend to legislate less and on fewer policy matters. Legislative competencies shift to the federal legislature through constitutional amendments or enactment of federal laws. I argue that this is due to the nationalization and centralization of parties and party systems. In federations with highly nationalized and centralized party systems, transaction costs of reforming the constitutional federal pact will be lower than in federations with regionalized systems and decentralized parties. I test this argument with data on federal elections and federal de/centralization between 1945 and 2010 in 11 federal countries. I use a two-way fixed effects strategy to confirm my argument that party-system nationalization is the main driving factor behind legislative centralization in federal systems. I test my causal mechanism through a multilevel linear model and find that it is Party Nationalization that causes legislative centralization in federal democracies.",

          "abstract": "Previous research has found that political traits have some degree of genetic basis, but researchers have had less success unpacking the relationship between genes and political behavior. We propose an approach for examining this relationship that can overcome many of the limitations of previous research: polygenic indices (PGIs). PGIs are DNA-based individual-level variables that capture the genetic propensity to exhibit a given trait. We begin by outlining how PGIs are derived, how they can be utilized in conventional regression-based research, and how results should be interpreted. We then provide proof of concept, using data on over 50,000 individuals in four samples from the U.S. and Sweden to show that PGIs for health and psychological traits significantly predict measures of political participation, even within families. We conclude by outlining several ideas and providing empirical examples for researchers who may be interested in building on the PGI approach.",

          "abstract": "Social construction theory postulates that policy outcomes depend on whether target groups are imagined by the public as deserving or undeserving. However, recent evidence demonstrates that the constructions in question are contentious rather than uniformly shared. This article applies the conjoint-experimental method to measure the social construction of immigrant (il)legality and to assess its political implications. We demonstrate that it is multidimensional because the absence of legal status is associated with receipt of government benefits, Hispanic origin, police record, poor English fluency, and less education. We also show that whereas the receipt of government benefits is not associated with the absence of legal status among most respondents, individuals who hold this association support stricter immigration-enforcement policies. Our findings corroborate the social construction approach but also indicate that researchers may want to measure multiple dimensions of target-group constructions in addition to deservingness.",
