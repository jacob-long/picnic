          "authors": "PAMELA BAN, SETH J. HILL",
          "abstract": "Oversight, scholars argue, allows Congress to control the executive agents it empowers to implement law. Yet the tools of oversight are rather limited and debate continues as to how much influence oversight provides. How well can members of Congress motivate bureaucratic performance? To measure the efficacy of oversight, we create a new dataset matching oversight efforts to a bureaucratic deficiency Congress has sought to reduce since the early 2000s: improperly made payments to contractors and clients. We estimate the effect of congressional hearings, one of the most important tools of congressional oversight, as well as correspondence, appropriation committee reports, statutes, and executive action. We find that hearings lead to subsequent declines in improper payments. The magnitude of the effect, however, is small relative to the scope of the problem, suggesting strong limits on the efficacy of oversight. Our findings imply that America’s elected officials struggle to effectively manage implementation of policy.",

          "abstract": "The online dating application has in recent years become a major avenue for meeting potential partners. However, while the digital public sphere has gained the attention of political philosophers, a systematic normative evaluation of issues arising in the “digital sexual sphere” is lacking. I provide a philosophical framework for assessing the conduct of dating app corporations, capturing both the motivations of users, and the reason why they find usage unsatisfying. Identifying dating apps as agents intervening in a social institution necessary for the reproduction of society, with immense power over people’s lives, I ask if they exercise their power in line with individuals’ interests. Acknowledging that people have claims to noninterference, equal standing, and choice improvement relating to intimacy, I find that the traditional, nondigital, sexual sphere poses problems to their realisation, especially for sexual minorities. In this context, apps’ potential for justice in the sexual sphere is immense but unfulfilled.",

          "abstract": "According to widely held views on good democratic practice, when political parties are in government, they should generally keep the promises they made to voters during the previous election campaigns that brought them to power. But what happens when things change dramatically between the times of promising and governing? We develop and test a theory of how economic uncertainty and change affects promise keeping. We argue that when parties formulate election pledges amid high levels of uncertainty, they make promises that can be kept even when significant negative economic changes transpire. We test the implications of the theory using a mixed methods approach, including a quantitative analysis of over 9000 election pledges made by parties from 13 countries. We also present new quantitative and qualitative evidence on pledge fulfillment by Australian parties, which offers a highly relevant test of the impact of unexpected events.",

          "abstract": "We use instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Llama 3, MiXtral, or Aya to position political texts within policy and ideological spaces. We ask an LLM where a tweet or a sentence of a political text stands on the focal dimension and take the average of the LLM responses to position political actors such as US Senators, or longer texts such as UK party manifestos or EU policy speeches given in 10 different languages. The correlations between the position estimates obtained with the best LLMs and benchmarks based on text coding by experts, crowdworkers, or roll call votes exceed .90. This approach is generally more accurate than the positions obtained with supervised classifiers trained on large amounts of research data. Using instruction-tuned LLMs to position texts in policy and ideological spaces is fast, cost-efficient, reliable, and reproducible (in the case of open LLMs) even if the texts are short and written in different languages. We conclude with cautionary notes about the need for empirical validation.",

          "abstract": "If instant runoff voting (IRV) mitigates strategic voting, is that because the rules of the system mechanically reduce strategic opportunities, or because of other more indirect effects? In single-vote plurality elections, a voter can be pivotal if adding one vote to a candidate would cause that candidate to win. In IRV, it is more complicated to identify when one voter can be pivotal. This letter derives all the ways that a single ballot can change the result of an IRV election, for any number of candidates and voters. I obtain an expression for the probability of casting a pivotal vote in IRV by phrasing the probability that any pivotal event occurs as a function of all the rankings cast by other voters. This expression facilitates modeling vote choice in IRV, and enables the estimation of voters’ strategic opportunities in IRV contests between any number of candidates. I present some illustrative simulations estimating pivotal probabilities in both IRV and Single-Member District Plurality for stylized electorates with identical preference structures. These simulations produce similar estimated pivotal probabilities in the two systems, suggesting that these systems may provide similar opportunities to strategically cast a decisive vote.",

          "abstract": "Threats to decent working conditions and cynical views of politicians are increasingly prevalent in contemporary societies. The present study examines the potential relationship between these two trends and the mediating role that anger‐related emotions may play in this relationship. Using latent growth modeling analyses and data from a panel survey of French employees collected during the 2021–2022 French electoral cycle, I found that within‐person decreases in employees' perceptions of decent work were associated with within‐person increases in anger and hostility toward the employing organization; increases in anger and hostility, in turn, were associated with within‐person increases in political cynicism. Moreover, both initial levels and increases in political cynicism were associated with a lower likelihood of electoral participation. Overall, this research highlights how longitudinal change in workplace experiences may drive the dynamics of political cynicism and indirectly affect the vitality of democracy.",

          "abstract": "Issues like transgender rights often provoke strong emotional reactions, leading to polarized conflicts. Moral psychology suggests that emotions like anger and disgust drive destructive behaviors, such as avoiding or insulting the opponent. However, we argue that constructive behaviors, such as listening to the opponent, are also possible. We propose that appraisals related to engaging and coping with moral disagreements also play critical roles in predicting different behaviors. In an online study with 902 participants from the UK, US, India, and Serbia, we explored these dynamics using a message exchange paradigm. Participants received a message, purportedly from another participant (“messenger”), that contradicted their attitudes toward transgender rights. They then provided emotional reactions, wrote a response, and indicated their willingness to engage in constructive or destructive behaviors with the messenger. Constructive behavioral intentions were predicted by greater empathy, lower disgust and anger toward the messenger, and a higher perceived ability to cope with responding. In contrast, destructive intentions were predicted by lower empathy, greater disgust, lower coping abilities, and higher perceived difficulty in responding. These findings enhance our understanding of behavioral responses to moral disagreements on contentious issues like transgender rights and suggest ways to promote constructive dialogue.",

The emergent applications of artificial intelligence in higher education (AIEd) in course preparation, delivery, and administration as well as in learning assistants and prediction for the sake of learners are widely considered important innovations that can change education worldwide. The Armenian case was examined via a survey that was conducted at the country’s leading universities to investigate whether and how faculty use AIEd. Although the results indicate that many Armenian teaching faculty use AIEd in narrow capacities and acknowledge the potential usefulness of AIEd in the practical administration of Armenia’s higher education, the use of AIEd is not deep.",

          "abstract": "Can incentive schemes deliver value in the public sector, despite major principal-agent challenges? We evaluate a reform that introduced individual teacher performance-related pay and tournaments in public schools in Portugal, despite trade union opposition. We find evidence that the focus on individual performance decreased student achievement (as measured by national exams) and increased grade inflation. The results follow from a difference-in-differences analysis of matched student-school panels and two complementary control groups (including private schools). Students with a higher proportion of teachers exposed to tournaments also perform worse. Overall, our results highlight the social costs of disrupting workers’ cooperation, a possible unintended consequence of public-sector tournaments.",
