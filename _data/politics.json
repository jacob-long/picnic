          "title": "The ethics of responding to democratic backsliding abroad",
          "authors": "James Pattison",
          "abstract": "The past decade has seen a marked shift as many previously liberal democratic states have backslidden, taking authoritarian turns. How should liberal actors respond to democratic backsliding by others? Although it might seem that it is vital for liberal actors to react robustly to avoid complicity or to maintain their liberal integrity, this paper argues that complicity‐based and integrity‐based approaches offer an incomplete picture of the ethical challenges posed by democratic backsliding and propose problematic responses. They tend to focus too much on the internal effects of backsliding, that is, the effects on the citizens within the backsliding state. Instead, the paper proposes a responsibility‐based approach that emphasizes the need to take much more seriously the external effects of backsliding, arguing that the central focus of responses to democratic backsliding should be the dangers posed to the fulfilment of global responsibilities.",

          "title": "National identity after conquest",
          "authors": "Christopher Carter, Daniel W. Gingerich",
          "abstract": "Conquering powers routinely adopt state‐directed nationalization projects that seek to make the boundaries of the nation coterminous with the (newly expanded) boundaries of the state. To this end, they implement policies that elevate the economic status of individuals who embrace the occupier's national identity and discriminate against those who do not. This paper develops a formal model that illuminates when such policies succeed or fail. We show that the effectiveness of discrimination hinges on the perceived longevity of occupation. If occupier rule is expected to be short‐lived, discrimination will backfire, as dissident parents transmit the marginalized national identity to their children; intense intergenerational socialization more than compensates for the negative wealth effects of discrimination. If occupier rule is instead perceived to be long‐lasting, discrimination will achieve its intended aims. Case studies on the Chilean occupation of Tacna, Peru (1880–1929), and the Prussian occupation of Northern Schleswig (1866–1920) illustrate the logic.",

          "abstract": "A decisive voter’s exact ideological preferences can be hard to predict, even for seasoned candidates. We develop a novel theory of electoral competition where candidates are evaluated on ideological and nonideological dimensions. The key feature of our theory is that an electorate’s partisan leaning serves as a signal of the median voter’s ideological position where extreme leanings are more informative about voters than centrist leanings. We show that this leads to an endogenous sorting of districts between “extreme” and “centrist” and that an increase in the importance of candidate competence for voters increases polarization—but only in extreme districts. We evaluate our theory using data from mayoral elections in Brazil’s 95 largest municipalities and exploit COVID-19 as a shock to the salience of candidate competence. We show that COVID-19 increases the salience of competence in these elections, leading to increased political polarization, which is concentrated in cities with extreme partisan leanings.",

          "authors": "Jamie J. Gruffydd-Jones",
          "abstract": "When the world’s leading human rights advocates violate international norms, how does this affect support for those norms around the world? Rather than diffusing norm breaking across borders, I argue that authoritarian states’ propaganda about liberal states’ violations may increase the salience of human rights norms in places where those norms are normally censored. Focusing on American racial discrimination, I find that the Chinese Communist Party publicizes American human rights violations on to its citizens for strategic political reasons. Through two survey experiments I show that while exposure to news about American discrimination does provide substantial propaganda benefits to the regime, it also makes Chinese respondents more supportive of minority rights and more critical of their own country’s respect for those rights. The study shows how prominent violations of international norms may be an underappreciated means of strengthening global public support for those norms.",

          "abstract": "Which predispositions drive voters’ policy attitudes? This article tests the role of political values as a driver of attitudes relative to two commonly posited sources – partisanship and symbolic ideology. Past work has found correlations between values and issue attitudes, but these cross-sectional studies have limited causal purchases. I test the effects of traditionalist and egalitarian values on issue stances using six ANES and GSS panel surveys from 1992 to 2020. I find that values drive within-voter changes in policy attitudes under a variety of specifications. Additionally, values shape attitudes on emergent policies, which I test using the cases of welfare reform in the 1990s and transgender policies in the 2010s. In all models, values have as large or larger effects on attitudes as that of partisanship or ideology. I conclude that values are a core predisposition which voters employ to make sense of policy issues.",

          "abstract": "How does China use development finance to gain influence in international organizations? Leveraging the exogenous rotation of ASEAN and African Union Chairmanship, I estimate the effect of regional leadership on Chinese commitments. Results suggest that Chinese projects are politically motivated only when the lending and recipient entities are linked to the Chinese and host governments. Governments that assume the Chair received seven times more commitments from Chinese government agencies relative to non-Chair years, a $90 million increase for the average project. By contrast, there is no evidence to suggest that Chinese banks act as agents of Beijing. Moreover, I find a consistent null relationship between temporary UN Security Council status and Chinese finance, unlike established findings about Western donors, suggesting that China is deliberately seeking regional influence. These results underscore the importance of considering the specific actors involved in China’s economic statecraft.",

          "authors": "Omar Hammoud-Gallego, Roberto S. Foa, Xavier Romero-Vidal",
          "abstract": "During the coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom, media outlets shifted their focus from divisive political issues to more neutral topics like lifestyle, sports, and entertainment. This study explores how this change in media content relates to partisan divides in satisfaction with democracy. Using data from a representative survey of 201,144 individuals, we linked respondents’ perceptions of democratic performance to their daily media exposure. We did so by analysing 1.5 million tweets from British newspapers using a topic modelling algorithm to identify shifts in topic salience and sentiment using sentiment analysis. Our findings reveal a decline in partisan media exposure during the pandemic, associated with increased satisfaction with democracy at both individual and collective levels, and a narrowing of cross-party divides. These results contribute to discussions on affective polarization, the winner-loser gap in democratic evaluation, and media framing effects, highlighting the potential influence of depoliticized news coverage on democratic attitudes.",

          "abstract": "Have concerns about equal rights and equal chances crowded out economic equality as a priority of left parties? Despite the increased importance of inequality in political science, this contentiously fought debate has been standing on shaky empirical foundations. While voter's equality preferences are well understood, parties’ equality emphases remain uncharted territory. This research note assesses whether the Left has replaced its emphasis on economic equality with a focus on equal chances and equal rights. Based on a new dataset of 300,000 party statements, we use online crowd‐coding to map the equality trajectories of left parties in 12 OECD countries from 1970 to 2020. We examine if trade‐offs between economic and non‐economic aspects of inequality have come to dominate left parties’ equality profiles. Distinguishing social democratic, green and far‐left parties, we refute a meritocratic or ‘woke’ crowding out of redistribution. Yet, Social Democrats have indeed forsaken the once complementary link between economic equality and equal rights in favour of a weak trade‐off.",

          "authors": "MATHIAS BUKH VESTERGAARD",
          "abstract": "Political parties face inherent risks when making election promises, as voters tend to penalize them for unfulfilled commitments. Nonetheless, parties make hundreds of promises. Why do parties engage in such precarious behaviour? I argue that parties employ a policy‐committing strategy when they need to increase the credibility of their policy programme and that they do so more today than previously because the political landscape has changed considerably in many Western democracies (time trend). Moreover, I expect parties to use the policy‐committing strategy more when they operate in a political arena with more competitors (system‐level factor), when they are a mainstream party (party‐level factor) and when they have increased the saliency of an issue (issue‐level factor). I test these four expectations with a unique, new dataset containing 330,850 quasi‐sentences coded from party manifestoes in 11 countries covering several decades of elections. Empirically, I find support for a time trend and show strong effects for the party‐level and issue‐level factors. However, a more competitive environment at the system level makes parties less, not more, likely to use the policy‐committing strategy. These results have important implications for party strategies, issue competition and policymaking in today's democracies.",

          "abstract": "Does the public apply a “double standard” for human rights abuses based on the perpetrator’s alliance status? Research shows that individuals are more supportive of military action against states that violate human rights. However, other studies claim that condemnations of violations are often contingent upon the strategic relationship with the perpetrators. In this paper, we bridge these different strands of literature by examining whether the effect of foreign states’ human rights practices on public support for war depends on the alliance status of the violator. To investigate this interaction, we conducted two preregistered experiments that independently randomized the state’s human rights practices and U.S. alliance status. Both experiments reveal that the alliance status of the human rights violator has a negligible effect on support for war. Consequently, our findings challenge the prevailing notion that the public applies a double standard for human rights violations.",

          "authors": "Andrew Bertoli, Chad Hazlett",
          "abstract": "Many influential political science articles use close elections to study how important outcomes vary after a certain type of candidate wins, such as a Democrat or a Republican. This politician characteristic regression discontinuity (PCRD) design offers opportunities for inferential leverage but also the potential for confusion. In this article, we clarify what causal claims the PCRD licenses, offering a rigorous causal analysis that points to three principal lessons. First, PCRDs do nothing to isolate the effect of the politician characteristic of interest as apart from other politician characteristics. Second, selection processes (regarding both “who runs” and “which elections are close”) can generate and exacerbate such confounding, as noted in Marshall (2024). Third and more fortunately, this approach does make it possible to estimate the average effect of electing a leader of type “A” vs. “B” in the context of close elections, treating the units as districts, not leaders. We also suggest a set of tools that can aid in falsifying key assumptions, avoiding unwarranted claims, and surfacing mechanisms of interest. We illustrate these issues and tools through a reanalysis of an influential study about what happens when extremists win primaries (Hall 2015).",

To address this, Study 1 (pre‐registered; N = 1,583) tested the efficacy of three short inoculation videos (prebunks) against three common manipulation tactics used in misinformation: (1) polarization, (2) conspiracy theories, and (3) fake experts. Results indicated that all three inoculation videos (vs. control) increased the detection of relevant manipulative content without altering perceptions of non‐manipulative content, but only the polarization inoculation video increased manipulation discernment (i.e., increased ability to distinguish between manipulative and non‐manipulative content). In Study 2 (pre‐registered; N = 1,603), we tested the efficacy of three more inoculation videos containing logic‐based prebunks against logical fallacies commonly used in misinformation: (1) whataboutism, (2) the moving the goalposts fallacy, and (3) the strawman fallacy. Detection of the relevant fallacious content was higher in all conditions (vs. control), but only the strawman fallacy inoculation video increased fallacy discernment. The moving the goalposts fallacy inoculation video appeared to increase overall distrust of relevant content, whereas the other two videos did not alter perceptions of relevant non‐fallacious content. We discuss the implications and limitations of these findings.",

          "abstract": "The significance and meaning of left–right ideology vary across cultures for both citizens and political elites. This article studies the adaptiveness of left–right ideology when individuals migrate. Drawing on acculturation research, I argue that individuals' economic and cultural orientations become more structured along traditional left–right lines when they migrate from Eastern Europe and countries further east—where left–right distinctions are weaker or have alternative meanings—to Western Europe, where classic left–right politics is more deeply ingrained. Using a sample of more than 400,000 natives and immigrants from 38 countries and a spatial difference‐in‐differences design, I find that immigration to Western Europe does not increase identification with left or right among people of Eastern origin, but it does strengthen the alignment between their economic orientations and ideological self‐identifications. Consistent with acculturation theory, the evidence also shows that both left–right self‐identification and attitude consistency increase with longer residence in Western Europe, particularly among immigrants who are more politically interested and engaged, suggesting that elite cue‐taking is an important mechanism. Results for cultural orientations are mixed. The findings advance our understanding of the dynamics of mass ideology and the political integration of immigrants in Western societies.",

The current contribution bridges the gap between individual and contextual perspectives and conceptualizes attitudes as joint products of personal ideologies and social norms, as such adopting a person‐within‐context approach. In two US samples (total N = 1150), representative in terms of age, gender, ethnic background (Studies 1–2), and political orientation (Study 2), we examined whether perceived levels of Right‐Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) in one's close groups (family, friends, colleagues, and people in one's town) were related to outgroup warmth and avoidance through one's own RWA and SDO. We also included norm enactment as a moderator of close‐group ideologies' effect on one's own ideologies. The results showed that close‐group ideologies were positively linked to participants' own RWA and SDO, which, in turn, were associated with lower outgroup warmth and higher outgroup avoidance in both studies. Most importantly, these effects were strongest for those who have a high desire to enact close‐group norms, and weakest for those who have a low desire for norm enactment. These findings highlight the significance of situating personal ideologies within their contextual plenum while studying intergroup relations.",

These models make a number of assumptions, many of which can be assessed empirically, sometimes for substantive ends. We use Monte Carlo simulations to show the order in which practitioners assess these assumptions can impact the model’s final specification, and ultimately, can produce misleading inferences. We focus on three assumptions regarding model specification decisions: proportional hazards (PH), stratified baseline hazards, and stratum-specific covariate effects. Our results suggest checking the PH assumption before checking for stratum-specific covariate effects tends to produce the correct final specification most frequently.

          "authors": "Anil Menon, Katie Nissen, Iain Osgood",
          "abstract": "How do the effects of climate regulation on businesses impact public attitudes toward climate policy? While emissions intensity is the primary frame for understanding the effects of climate policy on business, theoretical scholarship and public discourse often emphasize that large firms will adjust to climate regulations easily while smaller firms will struggle. Because small businesses are sympathetic and large firms are unpopular, individuals who view climate regulation’s effects in line with this firm size account should be less likely to support climate change mitigation. To test this theory, we conduct an original survey of climate policy beliefs and then a survey experiment. We find evidence that distaste for large corporations increases opposition to climate action among people exposed to the idea that big companies can more easily navigate climate regulations than small companies. This work contributes to the literature on moral political economy and on the enduring difficulty of enacting effective climate change regulation within the United States.",

          "abstract": "In this article, I study the effect of endogenous challenger entry on electoral accountability in the presence of adverse selection. To this end, I analyze a two-period electoral agency model wherein a potential challenger freely chooses whether to run for office. The effect of endogenous challenger entry on policy decisions in this model is ambiguous: depending on model parameters, it can worsen or ease policy distortions. Analogously, marginally increasing the cost of running for office can deepen or reduce these distortions. This uncertainty regarding the effect of endogenous challenger entry on policymaking leads to equally ambiguous welfare implications. Nonetheless, I identify conditions under which endogenous challenger entry improves policymaking and voter welfare. This suggests that, in some circumstances, imposing higher barriers to entry in elections can improve policymaking and voter welfare.",

We collected data on 115,427 articles and 12,696 books—written in both English and other languages—from 5,586 faculty members in 178 departments in North America, Europe, Asia, Latin America, Oceania, and Africa. Departments are ranked in terms of citations to articles published by faculty members, impact factors of journals in which they published, and number of top publications in which they published. Results are presented for overall and more recent research productivity.",

          "authors": "Nicholas C. D’Amico",
          "abstract": "Although linked fate has been recognized as a driving force in the politics of various identity groups, should this theoretical framework be applied to queer politics? I ask, what are the outcomes and dynamics of linked fate among members of the queer community? How does linked fate shape queer political participation? Is the concept an adequate indicator of politicized queer identity? Drawing on data from the Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey, I uncover widespread linked fate among queer Americans, with significant variation along the lines of intersectional identity. Linked fate can motivate participation, but more powerfully shapes participation beyond the ballot box. I close by calling for a queer-specific metric of linked fate that accounts for several dimensions of queer political identity. As the queer community grows increasingly salient in US party politics, this study identifies avenues for future research into this diverse population.",

          "authors": "Marc Debus, Julius Diener, Noam Himmelrath, Christian Stecker",
          "abstract": "The Russian invasion of Ukraine has significant implications not only for foreign, defence, economic and energy policies of European democracies, but also for their societal cohesion. While the debates about sanctions against Russia are mainly structured along partisan lines, with supporters of far-left and far-right parties tending to be against harsh responses, we argue that also a specific migrant background and an ethnic identity matter for the position on this highly salient and polarizing issue. Using original survey data from Germany, we find that respondents with a Russian or a Turkish ethnic background are less in favour of sanctions against Russia. This finding remains robust when considering respondents’ party preferences, education level, age, religious affiliation, and their region of residence, whether in Western or Eastern Germany. The results suggest that Russia’s war against Ukraine is likely to create tensions not only between individuals with different ideological orientations, but can also result in conflicts between citizens with and without a Russian or Turkish migrant background or identity.",
