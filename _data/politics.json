          "authors": "Kimberly J. Morgan",
          "abstract": "The politics of childcare has become a vibrant area of research. This review analyzes the evolution of this research over several decades and identifies two phases of scholarship. The first phase concerned the limited public supports for childcare in most countries and how this reinforced a particular gender order. A second current of research took off as many countries expanded their childcare systems and highlighted the role of electoral politics and ideas about public spending on childcare as an investment in human capital. In the drive to explain patterns of policy change, the research focus has narrowed, occluding the substantive impact of different childcare systems. Future research should probe the stubbornness of gender inequalities in paid work and care and how politics and public policies shape different care economies.",

          "authors": "David Niven",
          "abstract": "Can partisanship itself – independent of any party mobilizing activity – help voters overcome participatory obstacles? Challenges for evaluating this question in normal circumstances abound as parties mobilize voters specifically based on their partisanship and in order to counter participatory hurdles they may face. Here, taking advantage of a quasi-experimental circumstance in which a targeted mobilizing effort was not feasible, I show that party membership itself reduced vulnerability to an unforeseeable electoral hurdle and did so even among a class of supervoters who participated in every recent election. Employing logistic regression and propensity matching to isolate the influence of party, the results show the inoculating effect of party applies not only to major U.S. parties (Democrats and Republicans), but also to adherents of minor parties, rendering partisans about 40% less likely to have their ballot thwarted. The results offer unique evidence that party loyalties have an effect independent of party mobilization and a stark warning that while party-less voters may not be the intended target of procedural voting hurdles, they are likely to bear the sternest burden of them.",

          "authors": "Ida B Hjermitslev",
          "abstract": "Recent research draws mixed conclusions about voters’ appreciation for compromise in politics. On one hand, compromise is touted as a democratic virtue and on the other hand, voters seem to punish politicians that are seen as too compromising. Do voters understand and appreciate that parties will have to make concessions on some issues in order to influence others? Or do voters prefer representatives who vouch to stay ideologically pure across the board? In a conjoint experiment, embedded in a survey of Austrian voters conducted in June 2022, I test various hypotheses about the interactive effects of policy positions, issue importance, and compromise behavior in a pre-electoral setting. I find that voters generally prefer willingness to compromise over steadfast principles, but this is particularly true if it moves policy outcomes closer towards themselves or if it is on issues they care less about.",

          "authors": "Mattia Gatti",
          "abstract": "Does intra-party dissent affect parties’ salience strategies? And if so, do leadership-dominated parties de-emphasize a divisive issue dimension more than activist-dominated ones? Scholars have long highlighted the role of intra-party dissent in informing parties’ salience strategies. However, the literature has overwhelmingly focused on EU issues while devoting less attention to the economic and socio-cultural dimensions of party competition. I argue that, driven by the imperative of projecting unity and ensure survival, parties facing internal dissent over an issue dimension reduce the emphasis attributed to it. Importantly, the effectiveness of this strategy hinges on the control party leaders wield over their parties’ platforms. Focusing on 15 Western European countries and 130 political parties, the findings confirm that higher levels of intra-party dissent are associated with lower emphasis awarded to the divisive issue dimension. The pooled results also suggest that markedly leadership-dominated parties are more effective in de-emphasizing a divisive dimension than activist-dominated ones. However, I find less robust evidence for the latter finding when testing the model separately for the two dimensions.",

          "title": "The Static and Dynamic Effects of Political Distrust on Support for Representative Democracy and its Rivals",
          "authors": "Tom W. G. van der Meer, Lisa A. Janssen",
          "abstract": "Distrust is widely argued to stimulate support for political and institutional change. Yet, there is little agreement among scholars whether distrust pulls people towards rivaling decision-making models such as direct democracy, technocracy, and authoritarianism. This paper argues that political distrust is an unconditional push-factor away from the status quo (i.e., representative democracy), but that the appeal of any specific alternative decision-making models among distrusters is conditional on their political dispositions. This paper systematically tests rivaling theories on the micro-level relationship between political distrust and support for change, representative democracy, and alternative decision-making models. Crucially, we test to what extent the pull-factor of rivaling models is conditional on citizens’ political efficacy and populist leaning. Moreover, we separate the effects of structurally low trust from that of dynamically declining trust by estimating Random Effects Within Between (REWB) models on three-wave panel survey data across four European countries (the UK, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Portugal). Our findings confirm that distrust unconditionally pushes people away from the status quo, but does not unconditionally pull people towards any alternative model. Rather than technocracy (mixed effects) and authoritarianism (predominantly negative effects), we find that political distrust particularly stimulates support for direct democracy. This positive effect of political distrust on support for direct democracy is particularly strong among efficacious citizens and supporters of populist parties. This aligns with the idea of dissatisfied democrats, whose distrust drives their ambition for more direct influence.",

          "authors": "Arvind Krishnamurthy",
          "abstract": "Existing research provides conflicting accounts of whether indirect exposure to the American carceral state mobilizes geographically proximate community voters. One possible reason for these mixed findings may be a missing connection between electoral participation and expectations of change in criminal legal policies. To remedy this problem, I leverage the inclusion of a well‐publicized ballot initiative in California, Proposition 47. The 2014 measure would substantially reduce the incarcerated population in the state and lower sanctions for non‐violent criminal offenses. Using census tract‐level vote returns and incarceration rates, I show that increasing levels of tract incarceration are associated with an increase in turnout during the year of Proposition 47 (3.8 to 6.9 pp) relative to past turnout levels. In addition, I show that higher tract incarceration rates are associated with more support for the Proposition (6.9 pp. difference). These results suggest that carceral state exposure may affect community political engagement differently based on the direct policy relevance of a given election for changing carceral state functioning.",

          "abstract": "Nativist populism is on the rise across many liberal democratic contexts, yet we know relatively less about how to challenge its negative impacts. This study investigates the effectiveness of a novel intervention designed to counter nativist populist rhetoric. We draw on a social identity mobilization approach, and across two randomized control experiments in the United Kingdom ( n = 850), test whether showing people how social identities can be used for influence effectively challenges populist and anti‐immigrant attitudes. In study 1, we found significantly lower populist attitudes among participants who received the intervention versus control. However, we did not observe any significant differences in anti‐immigrant attitudes. In study 2, we developed the immigration materials and employed a more comprehensive assessment that considered pre‐existing attitudes. Results replicated the effects on populist attitudes but did not indicate impacts on anti‐immigration attitudes. Notably, the effects on populist attitudes were maintained after controlling for age, gender, education, political orientation, and political interest. Overall, our intervention represents a novel avenue to addressing challenges posed by nativist populist rhetoric. Furthermore, the paper highlights the potential of leveraging social identity mobilization research to challenge political rhetoric, contributing wider insights for future interventions.",

          "authors": "Peter Beattie, Elena Sherstoboeva",
          "abstract": "What mass publics know about foreign affairs is of great importance in international politics. Knowledge and ignorance probabilistically delimit the range of opinions likely to form on foreign affairs issues. Military strategists understand the importance of “information warfare,” since publics apply foreign affairs knowledge to form opinions that may help or hinder a government's foreign policy goals. However, little research has investigated what the Russian and U.S. publics know about the invasion of Ukraine. By using a signal detection technique to assess the accuracy of, and bias in, knowledge related to the war in its first few months, this study provides insight into the knowledge both publics used to form opinions about the conflict in mid‐2022. The results indicate that both groups have more accurate knowledge pertaining to the dominant narrative in the opposing country, compared to the dominant narrative in their own country. Both groups evinced greater bias toward their own‐country narrative, with Russians more biased than Americans. These results are connected to differences and similarities in the two countries' media systems and political contexts. Normative implications differ; from a classical realist international relations perspective, public ignorance is expected and irrelevant, but some versions of democratic theory require unbiased and accurate knowledge found absent here.",

          "abstract": "How can political science scholars use visualization and mapping tools to refine the development of research on complex theoretical concepts? Literature mapping, a powerful method commonly used in the natural sciences to visualize scientific landscapes, is not yet widely used in political science. This study illustrates the capabilities of this method by analyzing visual maps of academic research on the term “organizing” in the context of political action. We describe our multistep methodological approach for generating the maps and demonstrate how they can be analyzed to produce insights about themes, potential gaps, canonical literature, and levels of dialogue across research areas. We conclude by outlining future research possibilities generated by this study’s literature mapping approach.",

          "authors": "Allison M. N. Archer, Erik Peterson",
          "abstract": "Today, few political news outlets receive universally favorable evaluations from the American public. In retaining broad public approval, local media remain a notable exception that is important to understand. We consider the durability of local news trust to criticism from politicians, focusing on Republican elites because they generally are more willing to attack the media than Democrats. In a survey experiment, we find that exposure to a Republican politician’s attack on a local newspaper dramatically reduces the public’s trust in and intent to use local news. This attack is particularly effective among Republicans, although it also leads Democrats and Independents to negatively shift their views of the local newspaper. Among those exposed to elite criticism of local news, overall trust and partisan divides between Republicans and Democrats resemble those for national media. This shows that the credibility of local news depends on the absence of elite criticism rather than resilience to it.",

Increased legislative effort could increase politicians’ job security, as they might be considered to be more desirable by voters, however, increased job security can change the incentives to engage in legislative activity. We analyse the behaviour of UK Members of Parliament (MPs) from 1997 to 2019 to examine the mechanisms driving any impact of job security on legislative effort, using an instrument for job security that is not impacted by individual effort. We show that the impact of job security on effort is primarily driven by an opportunity cost of time allocation mechanism, with MPs who are less secure in their job allocating less of their time to legislative activities. This opportunity cost increases with the breadth of their legislative effort, and is primarily driven by individuals with lower outside options, who face a greater cost of electoral defeat. We provide reduced-form evidence that this opportunity cost is primarily driven by the maintenance of non-parliamentary human capital by MPs, rather than activities designed to improve their electoral prospects.",

          "authors": "Maxwell B. Allamong, Jongwoo Jeong, Paul M. Kellstedt",
          "abstract": "Open-ended survey questions have a long history in public opinion research and are seeing a renewed interest as computing power and tools of text analysis proliferate. A major challenge in performing text analyses on open-ended responses is that the documents—especially if transcribed or collected through web surveys—may contain measurement error in the form of misspellings which are not easily corrected in a reliable and systematic manner. This paper provides evidence that large language models (LLMs), specifically OpenAI’s GPT-4o, offer a flexible, dependable, and low-cost solution to correcting misspellings in open-ended responses. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach with open-ended responses about the Democratic and Republican parties from the 1996–2020 American National Election Studies, where GPT is shown to correct 85%–90% of misspellings identified by human coders in a sample of responses. Following spelling correction on ∼50,000 responses, we document several consequential changes to the data. First, we show that spelling correction reduces the number of unique and single-use tokens while increasing the number of words matched to a sentiment dictionary. Then, to highlight the potential benefits and limitations of spelling correction we show improved out-of-sample prediction accuracy from a text-based machine learning classifier. Finally, we show a significantly larger degree of emotionality is captured in the spelling-corrected texts, though the size of this measure’s relationship with a known correlate in political interest remains relatively unchanged. Our findings point to LLMs as an effective tool for reducing measurement error by correcting misspellings in open-ended survey responses.",

Here, replication is an entrance decision, as a Replicator chooses whether or not to Replicate a given paper. A high level of social connectedness between members of a research community increases the field-wise False Discovery Rate, a measure of the social welfare associated with a healthy publication process. The moral is that larger, more diverse academic fields with fewer social ties are more likely to have an adversarial culture around replication, and that this improves social welfare. I consider three proposals to improve replication practices: Random auditing, or police-patrol replication; automated unit tests; and a recent proposal to lower the threshold for statistical significance. I argue that random auditing and automated unit tests can improve social welfare, but that the effect of lowering the statistical significance threshold is ambiguous.",

We report results of a field experiment attempting to identify whether the reverse is true. Specifically, we examine the effects of providing public opinion information to journalists on their perceptions of the newsworthiness of different topics. We randomly assigned journalists to receive results of a survey of Americans about the importance of different political issues, and followed up with a survey of those journalists (from a different source) asking about the newsworthiness of stories about those issues. The results provide some support for the hypothesis that public opinion influences journalists’ perceptions of topical newsworthiness, particularly on low salience issues, and also allow us to rule out large opinion effects on journalists’ perceptions of the newsworthiness of certain issues. The effects appear to be more pronounced for those journalists with less experience in the communities in which they currently work. Overall, we see the research as both offering insight into the nature of the effects that public opinion has on news coverage and helping guide future research, which we consider in the concluding section.",
