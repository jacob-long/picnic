          "authors": "Diana Da In Lee, Yamil Ricardo Velez",
          "abstract": "Ethnicity and race are vital for understanding representation, yet individual-level data are often unavailable. Recent methodological advances have allowed researchers to impute racial and ethnic classifications based on publicly available information, but predictions vary in their accuracy and can introduce statistical biases in downstream analyses. We provide an overview of common estimation methods, including Bayesian approaches and machine learning techniques that use names or images as inputs. We propose and test a hybrid approach that combines surname-based Bayesian estimation with the use of publicly available images in a convolutional neural network. We find that the proposed approach not only reduces statistical bias in downstream analyses but also improves accuracy in a sample of over 16,000 local elected officials. We conclude with a discussion of caveats and describe settings where the hybrid approach is especially suitable.",

          "title": "Austerity and Social Spending: Estimating the Long-Run Effects of Fiscal Adjustment",
          "authors": "Nils Blossey",
          "abstract": "Ageing populations and slower growth have compelled governments in mature welfare states to implement fiscal adjustments, but uncertainty persists about whether these measures have successfully curtailed the size of the welfare state. This letter documents that fiscal adjustments reduce social spending more effectively than previously thought. Using data from sixteen advanced economies between 1978 and 2018 and the narrative identification of adjustment plans, I estimate cumulative multipliers with local projections. I find that fiscal adjustments persistently lower social spending, including key components of social consumption and social investment. To explain why austerity does not shelter the welfare state, I present stylized facts about the timing and composition of adjustment plans. First, while public investment cuts concentrate at the beginning of the adjustment period, social consumption cuts accumulate over time. Second, large budget deficits and financial crises are frequent antecedents of the most ambitious fiscal reforms.",

          "title": "Should Political Discrimination be Unlawful?",
          "authors": "Thomas W. Simpson",
          "abstract": "Should people be protected by law from discrimination on the grounds of political affiliation and belief? I argue that individuals’ democratic right to exercise political agency – which implies freedom of association and freedom to express one’s political belief – requires that individuals should not be vulnerable to being treated disadvantageously because of their political affiliation and belief. To accomplish this, the protectorate of discrimination law should be expanded where relevant to include that characteristic. Moreover, in contexts where political and specifically affective polarisation is severe, the risk of such treatment increases, further justifying the legal innovation. While this thesis has received almost no prior discussion in the literature on the normative justification of discrimination law, and is revisionary in the UK and the USA, this absence is striking both in a comparative legal context and especially given the centrality of these freedoms to democratic politics.",

          "authors": "Simon Chauchard, Sumitra Badrinathan",
          "abstract": "Misinformation has emerged as a key threat worldwide, with scholars frequently highlighting the role of partisan motivated reasoning in misinformation belief. Yet the mechanisms enabling the endorsement of misinformation may differ in contexts where other identities are salient. This study explores whether religion drives the endorsement of misinformation in India. Using original data, we first show that individuals with high levels of religiosity and religious polarization endorse significantly higher levels of misinformation. Next, to understand the causal mechanisms through which religion operates, we field an experiment where corrections rely on religious messaging, and/or manipulate perceptions of religious ingroup identity. We find that corrections including religious frames (1) reduce the endorsement of misinformation; (2) are sometimes more effective than standard corrections; and (3) work beyond the specific story corrected. These findings highlight the religious roots of belief formation and provide hope that social identities can be marshalled to counter misinformation.",

          "title": "Cleaning up Politics: Anti-Corruption Appeals in Electoral Campaigns",
          "authors": "Sofia Vera",
          "abstract": "Recent elections around the globe have seen politicians increasingly adopt anti-corruption rhetoric, yet little is known about the conditions under which such appeals are effective. While existing literature has focused on the factors that mitigate electoral sanctions for corrupt politicians, it has often overlooked the relevance of anti-corruption efforts. This paper investigates the impact of anti-corruption promises on electoral support and perceived effectiveness in cleaning up government. Using an unforced conjoint experiment in corruption-prone Paraguay, I vary candidate profiles with different anti-corruption platforms, genders, and disciplinary records. The results reveal that anti-corruption appeals significantly influence electoral support. Concrete anti-corruption promises with specific policies are more persuasive, indicating citizens prefer substance over vague rhetoric. Surprisingly, a clean disciplinary record does not substantively enhance a candidate’s anticorruption appeal, and male candidates appear to benefit more from adopting anticorruption platforms. These findings illuminate under what conditions anti-corruption platforms are more effective. They highlight the importance of specific policy stands and reveal that having a history of corruption surprisingly does not damage the credibility of anticorruption advocates.",

          "authors": "Kevin L. Cope",
          "abstract": "This article develops the first dynamic method for systematically estimating the ideologies and other traits of nearly the entire federal judiciary. The Jurist-Derived Judicial Ideology Scores (JuDJIS) method derives from computational text analysis of over 20,000 written evaluations by a representative sample of tens of thousands of jurists as part of an ongoing, systematic survey initiative begun in 1985. The resulting data constitute not only the first such comprehensive federal-court measure that is dynamic, but also the only such measure that is based on judging, and the only such measure that is potentially multi-dimensional. The results of empirical validity tests reflect these advantages. Validation on a set of several-thousand appellate decisions indicates that the ideology estimates predict outcomes significantly more accurately than the existing appellate measures, such as the Judicial Common Space. In addition to informing theoretical debates about the nature of judicial ideology and decision-making, the JuDJIS initiative might lead courts scholars to revisit some of the lower-court research findings of the last two decades, which are generally based on static, non-judicial models. Perhaps most importantly, this method could foster breakthroughs in courts research that, until now, were impossible due to data limitations.",

          "abstract": "Moralising language is a powerful rhetorical tool for signaling political identity, persuading audiences, and mobilising voters. The valid and reliable classification of moral language is therefore a critical objective for political scientists. Recent advances in automated text analysis have introduced myriad new strategies for measuring morality in language, but have often produced conflicting, inconclusive findings. We investigate whether this diversity of moral content analyses might partially explain inconclusive findings, using a large corpus of political manifestos in four different languages (N=810 manifestos). Our results show that, despite starting from the same framework of Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), different instruments and underlying methodologies lead to remarkably different results for extracting moral foundations. Reproducing a previous study on political parties’ ideology and their use of moral foundations, we find that different measurements can lead to opposite effect directions. We discuss the relevance of our findings for research at the intersection of politics and moral rhetoric using automated text analysis.",

          "abstract": "Authoritarians’ electoral victories often catch worldwide attention as they are detrimental to global democracy. But despite the salience of their victories, we know little about whether these events abroad change citizens’ satisfaction with democracy (SWD). Building on the transnational learning literature, this research tests two diverging effects regarding the spillover of an authoritarian’s electoral victory. Citizens may be less satisfied with domestic democracy (contagion/domino effect) or see their democracy in a rosier light (benchmark effect). Additionally, because of motivated reasoning, such effects may be heterogeneous among citizens with different ideologies. To test for these expectations, I re-analyse two datasets collected in Europe amid the 2016 US presidential election. Both studies demonstrate a modest benchmark effect, as citizens’ SWD increases after Trump’s unexpected victory. Also, the heterogeneity analysis finds that the benchmark effect is most prominent among citizens who previously voted for socialist/radical left parties or liberal parties. I discuss how these findings enrich the literature on autocratization, transnational learning and satisfaction with democracy.",

          "abstract": "There continues to be a pressing need to design and test effective corrections in response to political misinformation, as citizens must have accurate information to be able to meaningfully participate in politics. Critical race theory (CRT) is an issue marked by widespread misinformation and controversy, leading to efforts in multiple states to ban CRT. In a three‐wave panel design with a nationally diverse U.S. sample, a correction of misinformation about CRT was tested. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) a control condition; (2) a misinformation‐only treatment; or (3) a misinformation plus correction treatment. Those in the misinformation plus correction condition had significantly higher accuracy scores than those in the control and misinformation‐only conditions. Moreover, this increased accuracy in the misinformation with correction condition was stronger among those most predisposed to accept CRT misinformation, that is, participants who scored high on a measure of unawareness of institutional discrimination. In contrast, participants' attitudes toward CRT bans were unaffected by the treatments, suggesting that correction can improve accuracy but does not change related opinions.",

          "abstract": "This article describes how and why propaganda affected recipients differently in two distinct situations, namely forced exposure and selective exposure, when they received propaganda during a series of six original survey experiments conducted in China. The prevailing view is that people are more likely to resist information they receive if their exposure to it is forced. But the study addressed in this article found that citizens who prefer not to view propaganda news, when given a choice, actually demonstrate higher average treatment effects on pro-regime attitudes compared to those who willingly read propaganda news (i.e. where participants in the control group were assigned a reading of non-propaganda news). Moreover, this study shows that participants who prefer not to read propaganda news exhibit higher average treatment effects when rating the issue presented in the news as more understandable and important—compared to those who willingly engage with the propaganda. That suggests a possible rationalization pathway in this phenomenon. 1",

          "abstract": "While research shows that public preferences across policy domains tend to move in parallel, the mechanisms behind this dynamic remain unclear. We examine four explanations: (1) alignment in preferred policy levels; (2) parallel policy movement combined with domain-specific thermostatic feedback; (3) feedback to global policy across domains; and (4) responsiveness to presidential partisanship. These mechanisms matter for how we interpret public opinion change and policy responsiveness. We develop and test a theoretical model using data on four social spending domains in the USA. Our findings suggest that spending mood reflects both parallelism in preferred policy levels and responsiveness to overall social spending and presidential party affiliation.",

          "abstract": "Presidents are often viewed as national policy leaders. Yet, they increasingly use negative rhetoric to attack the opposition rather than forge legislative compromise, contrary to theories of going public. Why? I argue presidents facing congressional obstruction eschew short-term policy persuasion. They speak as negative partisans to mobilize co-partisans and shape the longer-term balance of power in Congress, improving future policy-making prospects. I collect all presidential speeches delivered between 1933 and 2024 and use transformer methods to measure how often, and how negatively, presidents reference the out-party. They do so when the policy-making environment is unfavorable: when majorities are tenuous, government is divided, and as elections approach. I provide additional support with a case study of Democrats’ 2009 filibuster-proof Senate majority. Finally, this rhetoric has behavioral impact: presidential negative partisanship decreases co-partisan approval of the opposition. This research alters our understanding of going public and reinforces the partisan dimension of modern presidential representation.",

The electoral “bonus” holds more or less steadily until the crash, at which point the vote plunges about 20% below the original win.

Yet, there are normative, ontological, and conceptual concerns that render these techniques incomplete, especially when deployed in the study of marginalized people. This article argues that survey research is limited mainly in the study of race, gender, sexuality, and class because it fails to capture the intricacies of political life. Furthermore, the general exclusion of marginalized voices in survey research represents a major concern for the veracity of our findings. In response, I suggest three recommendations to help political scientists extend survey methods and tell more comprehensive stories about the political experiences and attitudes of marginalized people. I contend that political science departments must make qualitative methods required training for graduate students; political scientists must engage in feminist methodologies in building their research agendas; and researchers studying marginalized people must engage in multimethodological research approaches that provide context and detail about the lived experiences of vulnerable people.",

          "authors": "Ennio E. Piano, Louis C. Rouanet",
          "abstract": "This paper explores the constitutional history of American Indian tribes since the 1930s. We compile a novel data set on 1,016 constitutional change episodes by 290 tribes. We leverage this information to explore the determinants of variation in tribal constitutional change over time and across tribes. First, we show that the location of tribes influences their propensity to amend, with tribes from the Great Plains and Eastern regions doing so at much higher rates than the rest. We then investigate the influence of changes in federal attitudes towards tribal sovereignty. Our analysis unveils a relationship between a tribe’s demographic and political characteristics on the one hand and its propensity to amend and constitutional longevity on the other. We show that membership size (in 1926) and whether a tribe adopts directly democratic forms of governance positively affects how much and how often it amends its constitution. We also find a surprising positive association between constitutional rigidity and the number and rate at which tribes amend. Our results confirm the influence of federal Indian policy on the trajectory of American Indian sovereignty. Changes in federal Indian policy significantly affect tribes’ choice to amend their constitutions, with the number of amendments per tribe per year doubling during the so-called ‘Self-Determination’ period (1968–1988).",
