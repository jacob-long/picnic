          "title": "Making the other side mad: How out‐group distaste benefits less competent candidates",
          "authors": "Joshua A. Strayhorn",
          "abstract": "I present a formal model of candidate evaluation in a context where voters within some group or political party learn information about to what extent various in‐group candidates (such as a slate of primary candidates) are disliked by an out‐group or opposing party. Thus, a voter's candidate evaluation is based in part on how they process information about which of their own candidates provoke particularly strong distaste from the out‐group. I show that exposure to information about out‐group distaste can cause voters to make misleading inferences about candidate characteristics, causing them to sometimes systematically prefer lower competence candidates. These effects are stronger for certain kinds of low‐information voters, and for more ideologically motivated voters. The model can thus explain under what conditions voters will support politicians who particularly aggrieve the opposition. This can also create secondary incentives for politicians to signal incompetence.",

          "authors": "Andrew Shorten",
          "abstract": "Religious establishment today often takes a multifaith form, whereby multiple religions are supported in different ways and to different degrees. In order to contribute to the development of a normative framework for assessing practices and regimes of multifaith establishment, this article recommends the concept of “social alienation.” Initially, social alienation is defended as a negative normative criterion to determine when specific establishment practices are unacceptable. This criterion is compared favorably with approaches that evaluate establishment practices by reference to an ideal of public reason or according to whether they convey an expressive harm, as well as with similar approaches based on a purely subjective understanding of alienation. Subsequently, it is also argued that addressing social alienation can support a case for multifaith religious establishment regimes that support or recognize minority religions, since it is often unequal establishment practices that socially alienate, not establishment as such.",

          "authors": "Melissa Schwartzberg, Arthur Spirling",
          "abstract": "We consider the Levellers' conception of equality relative to their contemporaries during the Civil War(s) period. We compile a corpus of hundreds of seventeenth−century pamphlets and combine this with novel word embedding techniques trained on millions of Early Modern English documents to make statements about word “meanings.” We focus on understanding of the phrase “peers and equals” (and its variants). We provide quantitative and qualitative evidence, in line with extant literature, that the Levellers—John Lilburne specifically—had a prevailing interest in equality in a way that is different to that expressed by other groups of the time. But contrary to current scholarship, we show that the Levellers and Lilburne were animated primarily by a particular institutional manifestation of legal equality: their interest in parity or the status of peers primarily pertained to the jury.",

          "authors": "LUCAS LEEMANN, PATRICK EMMENEGGER, ANDRÉ WALTER",
          "abstract": "Direct democratic institutions are often introduced by popular vote, but there is little research on what motivates voters to support these new instruments. Using a unique dataset on the ideological positions of voters and members of parliament, this article examines support for the introduction of the initiative right in a popular vote. We find that voters support the initiative right when they are inadequately represented in parliament. Moreover, the analysis shows that the voting behavior is consistent with voters understanding the strategic implications of adopting the popular initiative. We demonstrate that voters support its adoption if they are ideologically more proximate to the median voter than they are to the median legislator. Finally, the article shows that ideological distance matters for voters of the ruling party as well, which helps explain why a majority of voters support a political institution that limits the ruling party’s room for maneuver.",

It argues that freedom of expression helps build the common knowledge needed for overcoming coordination problems and is, thus, a source of collective power. However, realizing the full empowering potential of freedom of expression requires supplementing it with (a) public sources of information that are reliable, trusted, and democratically accountable and (b) measures that will provide citizens with equal opportunity to speak and be heard in ways that will enable them to contribute to their society’s stock of common knowledge.",

          "authors": "Benny Geys, Rune J. Sørensen",
          "abstract": "Affluent citizens commonly record higher election turnout than less affluent citizens. Yet, the causal effect of affluence on voter turnout remains poorly understood. In this article, we rely on Norwegian administrative data to estimate the impact of random, exogenous shocks in (unearned) income on individual-level voter turnout. Exploiting the random timing and size of lottery wins for identification, our main findings suggest that a lottery windfall in the years just before an election boosts individuals’ turnout probability by 1.6 to 1.9 percentage points. Crucially, these point estimates reflect only a small share of turnout differences observed across the income distribution. Hence, our findings strongly suggest that most of the commonly observed positive income-turnout associations do not reflect a causal relationship.",

          "abstract": "Experimental research has shown that political parties often, but not always, suffer reputational costs when they change their policy positions. Yet, it is not clear who accepts and who rejects party policy change. Using newly collected observational data from five European countries (Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom), we examine the individual‐level determinants of party policy change. We examine support for policy change with a new survey item that directly captures party policy change acceptance. We theorise that acceptance of party policy change varies as a function of individuals' political attitudes such as their level of interest in politics and their ideological positions, as well as their views about democratic decision‐making. Although we find that many citizens agree that change is sometimes necessary and understand the conditions and constraints that lead parties to alter their positions, we also show that populist attitudes have a strong negative effect on accepting party policy change. A textual analysis of an open‐ended survey item furthermore indicates that those who perceive party policy change negatively, associate change with opportunism and power‐seeking. Our results imply that even though parties have some leeway to change their positions when external conditions require them to do so, populist beliefs and anti‐elite sentiment make citizens rather sceptical of the motivations that parties have when they alter their positions.",

          "authors": "SOPHIA STUTZMANN",
          "abstract": "Past research has often attributed electoral backlash to structural economic change to a lack of compensation and interest group representation for affected groups. Is that backlash then mitigated in contexts where both of these conditions are fulfilled? I argue that perceived economic deprivation fuelling political disengagement as well as disappointment with the issue‐owning party are important factors contributing to such a backlash. Using the case of Germany, I empirically analyse the electoral repercussions of a coal phase‐out in the presence of compensation for affected groups as well as active involvement of labour and business interests in political decision‐making. By employing a series of staggered difference‐in‐differences models, I investigate whether the closures of coal plants and mines between 2007 and 2022 affected voting behaviour at the municipal level. I find that these closures resulted in an asymmetric backlash in the form of lower vote shares for the issue owner, the Social Democratic Party and higher abstention rates in affected municipalities. With the significant politicisation around fossil fuel‐based energy generation, these findings have important implications for the remaining coal phase‐outs worldwide.",

Specifically, it explores whether business groups are more effective than citizen groups in pushing their ‘dream’ issues on the policy agenda while keeping their ‘nightmare’ issues off. Empirically, I rely on a content analysis of 818 media articles, 37 interviews with public officials and 148 interviews with interest representatives, all involved in 56 EU policy issues. The findings demonstrate that citizen groups are more influential in the agenda‐setting stage when compared to their business counterparts, particularly when they garner media visibility. These results bear important implications for democratic governance, offering new insights into the political influence wielded by interest groups.",

          "abstract": "Growing evidence exists about the importance of dark personality traits – narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism – in political leaders, broadly leading to heightened political aggressiveness and partisan conflict. Building on this expanding research agenda, we study the possible association between dark personality in politicians and deepened affective polarization – that is, increased affective distance between partisan groups coupled with stronger dislike for out‐parties – in the public. We do so by linking a large‐scale expert survey (NEGex) and a collection of post‐election surveys (CSES), including information for more than 90 leading candidates having competed in 40 elections worldwide. Our results show that the dark personality of top politicians can be associated with upticks in affective polarization in the public – but only when it comes to the personality of in‐party candidates (that is, a candidate from voters' preferred party), and only for high levels of ideological proximity between the candidate and the voter.",

          "abstract": "The ideological fit between party grassroots and leaderships has long been a concern for political science, with members in general, and young members in particular, thought to be more radical. However, we do not know, first, whether this is still the case and, if it is, what drives members in different ideological directions. To investigate, we propose a new typology of members as radicals, moderates and aligned, and develop a theoretical framework that accounts for how political socialization and party contexts drive congruence and incongruence. We test this using YOUMEM survey data from over 4,000 members of 12 youth wings in six countries. Our results show that while radicals are the largest group in most youth wings, they are more common on the centre‐left than the centre‐right. They tend to have been in the youth wing for longer than aligned members, but are under‐represented among politically ambitious members. Our findings thus shed light on opinion structures within political parties and provide a typology for future research on intra‐party cohesion.",

          "authors": "Juan Mérida, Ramón A. Feenstra",
          "abstract": "In 2014 and 2015, dozens of ‘municipalist’ candidates gained huge success in the Spanish local elections. These movement parties, intrinsically linked to the intense mobilisations of the previous electoral cycle, adopted a horizontal organisational model in contrast to the traditional oligarchic structure. In the wake of the 2015–2023 electoral cycles, however, there has been little analysis of these experiences and the processes they adopted. This study examines four such experiences in Zaragoza, Valladolid, A Coruña and Castellón through 72 interviews and documentary analysis. The study contributes to the debate on internal democracy in political parties in three ways, demonstrating: (1) a certain inevitable distancing between movement and party with power concentrated in the latter; (2) imposition of the institutional pace and the difficulty of combining it with the logic of direct democracy; and (3) demystification of certain forms of direct democracy and the need to combine vertical and professional logics with horizontal and participatory ones.",

          "abstract": "Party affiliation in the United States is increasingly aligned with multiple social identities. In this era of social sorting, to what extent is polarization motivated by partisan identities compared to other overlapping identities in non‐political settings? Using a conjoint survey experiment to examine the multivariate nature of affective polarization, we find that political identity outweighs all other social identities in informing citizens' attitudes and projected behaviors towards others. In addition, we find that partisanship usually outweighs ideology, but ideology matters in driving polarization; Democrats dislike Republicans more than Republicans dislike Democrats; and partisan identity has a particularly strong effect on racial and religious biases and preferences. Contrary to assumptions, cross‐cutting identities do not appear to dampen social polarization. We also find that, while out‐group animosity is stronger than in‐group sentiment in abstract attitudinal measurements, the results are mixed in interpersonal behavioral measurements, suggesting that partisan animus between citizens at the community level may be more nuanced than often suggested.",

          "abstract": "Little is known about the link between childhood and adolescent mental health (MH) difficulties and political outcomes in adulthood. This represents an important knowledge gap in understanding early individual‐level factors for future political outcomes. Using the Growing up in Ireland cohort, which follows 8568 children from 9 to 20 years, we examine how different MH difficulties, and their co‐occurrence, are associated with various political outcomes. The results show childhood/adolescent MH difficulties are important predictors of political outcomes at age 20. Adolescents with chronic co‐occurring MH difficulties starting in childhood report a lower interest in politics, lower trust in politicians, are less likely to register to vote, but if voting, are more likely to vote for an antiestablishment party. Adolescents with chronic emotional MH difficulties starting in childhood also report lower trust in politicians, are less likely to register to vote, and report a higher likelihood of voting for an antiestablishment party when voting. Additionally, they evidence lower levels of external political efficacy.",

          "authors": "Robert Anstett",
          "abstract": "This article examines the effectiveness of LGBTQ groups in Congress by looking at voting in favor of bills concerning queer rights. I find that the effect of donations is present in the early period of queer bills before Congress but disappears in bills post-2018. Instead, party is the dominant explanation for votes on bills. This has implications for the strategies that should be employed by LGBTQ+ interests at the national level and implications for how political science should examine the interactions between interest groups and new venues of change.",
