title: "Building a Permanent Filter"
text: To filter journals, append the URL parameters `hide` and `show` and bookmark the resulting URL. For example by appending `?hide=APSR` to the `paper-picnic.com/politics`, all articles from the American Political Science Review are hidden. To filter out content from multiple journals, use a comma separated list, i.e., `?hide=APSR,AJPS,JOP`. To only show content from specific journals, use the `show` parameter, e.g., `?show=APSR,AJPS,JOP`. The parameter `hide` and `show` can also include bundle tags for journals, e.g., `?hide=@IR` will hide all international relations journals.
