          "authors": "İrem Yılmaz-Özdemir, Tim Wildschut, Constantine Sedikides, Erich W. Graf",
          "abstract": "We developed a new nostalgia induction using virtual reality. We compared this virtual reality task (VRT) with the established event reflection task (ERT) in terms of intensity of felt nostalgia and strength of psychological benefits produced by each induction method (Experiment 1) and the durability of these effects over time (Experiment 2). Offering initial validation for the VRT, Experiment 1 revealed that felt nostalgia and psychological benefits were higher in the nostalgia condition than in the control condition, irrespective of the induction method. In Experiment 2, we improved the VRT and measured felt nostalgia and psychological benefits at five time points, separated by 5-min intervals. The augmented VRT produced significantly stronger effects on felt nostalgia than did the ERT, and it retained this advantage over time. Compared to the ERT, the VRT did not produce significantly stronger effects on psychological benefits. Instead, psychological benefits were higher in the nostalgia than control condition at each time point except the final one, irrespective of induction method. Virtual reality environments can induce vivid, durable feelings of nostalgia and ensuing psychological benefits.",

          "authors": "Charles B. Chang, Sunyoung Ahn, Youngjoo Kim",
          "abstract": "To facilitate objective measures of proficiency for language users of diverse backgrounds, recent research in second language acquisition and multilingualism has developed short, yet reliable, tests of lexical knowledge in a wide range of languages. In this paper, we describe the development of LexKO, a brief lexically based test of Korean language proficiency, including its underlying logic, composition, intended use, and limitations. Three rounds of pilot and validation testing with first- and second-language Korean users resulted in a highly reliable Korean test comprising 60 items that can be completed in a few minutes. Freely available for other researchers to use, LexKO produces scores that correlate significantly with both first- and second-language Korean users’ scores on a standardized proficiency test (an abridged version of the Test of Proficiency in Korean) and may thus be helpful in multi-part studies for obtaining a quick, valid measure of proficiency in Korean, one of the world’s fastest-growing foreign languages.",

          "authors": "Kyle Cox, Benjamin Kelcey",
          "abstract": "Bayesian and structural-after-measurement (SAM) approaches have been developed, in part, to address limitations of conventional estimators in the context of structural equation models (SEMs) with latent interactions. Although both approaches have shown promise in a variety of contexts including small-sample studies, there is very little literature systematically comparing the relative benefits, limitations, and trade-offs among these approaches. In this study, we (a) compared the performance of estimators under each approach in multilevel SEMs with a within-, between-, or cross-level latent interaction and (b) demonstrated the flexibility of SAM approaches by extending and investigating them in partially nested SEMs with latent moderated mediation. The results suggest substantial differences between estimator performance as a function of the type of latent interaction. SAM approaches performed well with a variety of latent interactions in multilevel and partially nested SEMs, while Bayesian approaches, including those with informative priors, struggled with models that included a cross-level latent interaction and were not easily extended to partially nested SEMs. Overall, the results suggest that SAM approaches are a versatile and highly adaptable alternative or complement to conventional full-information estimators. To conclude, we outline estimator considerations based on the SEM type, latent interaction, and data structure.",

          "authors": "J. W. C. Harris, M. J. Murphy, P. A. Chouinard",
          "abstract": "The recording and interpretation of lifting force data — such as load and grip forces — are central to studying weight perception. Typically, such data are collected using force transducer-embedded handles placed on top of objects. While effective, these handles may be impractical or undesirable for certain experimental paradigms. A potential alternative is a force transducer-embedded platform, but validation is needed to determine whether it captures force data with the same consistency and interpretability as the handle-based method, particularly given the potential for data loss around lift-off. In two experiments, we compared these methods by having participants lift light and heavy objects off a platform either directly or via handles to assess the convergent validity of experimental outcomes and the concurrent validity of the recorded data. Our findings indicate that the experimental outcomes and data from both methods were highly comparable, but only for the heavy objects. However, for the light object, platform-recorded force data showed lower agreement with handle-based measures, and several anticipated sensorimotor effects were not observed in the platform data. These discrepancies resulted in differences in experimental outcomes, particularly in the detection of switch effects, highlighting the platform’s limitations for capturing lighter-weight interactions. Therefore, we suggest that while handles remain preferable for capturing rich force data, the platform method broadens methodological options and presents a viable and valid alternative.",

          "authors": "Gal Sasson-Lazovsky, Vered Pnueli, Yoed N. Kenett",
          "abstract": "Question-asking is a crucial aspect of human interaction. Questions fuel engagement, stimulate thought processes, foster learning, and facilitate information-seeking behavior. Yet, scarce empirical research exists on question-asking, or its relation to related cognitive capacities such as creativity, curiosity, and intelligence. The use of digital games as a research medium offers significant advantages for studying cognitive processes in natural settings. As such, this study empirically investigates how people ask questions in an online serious game. To do so, we developed an online game—Spot the Spy—where players are required to find a hidden spy amidst a crowded room, by asking a chatbot agent questions that guide them in their investigation. Our game thus offers to investigate question-asking in natural settings empirically, and optimal question-asking strategies, which we conducted in two studies. Study 1 (online, N = 103) focused on game development and exploratory validation, whereas Study 2 (in-lab, N = 100) focused on replication and extension. In both studies, participants completed a series of cognitive tasks assessing creativity, curiosity, and intelligence before playing the game. Our results highlight strategies related to optimal performance in the game, as well as how players’ gameplay correlates with their cognitive abilities, especially with intelligence. Specifically, we found that higher intelligence scores were associated with more effective questioning strategies and better game performance. These insights highlight the potential of gamified environments to enhance our understanding of cognitive processes and advance the development of educational and training tools that foster strategic thinking and question-asking capacities.",

          "abstract": "Does education about historical racism land differently when accompanied by evidence of modern racial disparities? In Study 1, students from a United States (U.S.) university and an online survey platform were randomly assigned to hear a podcast about historical racist practices in higher education (e.g., states’ efforts to avoid integrating universities), modern racial disparities (e.g., Black student representation at flagship public universities), or both combined. Asked to evaluate attributions for current educational racial inequalities, participants in the combined and history conditions agreed more with structural and interpersonal racism attributions compared to participants in the modern disparities condition. Racism attributions—especially structural—mediated increases in reparative policy support. Study 2 also recruited nonstudents and added a control podcast. It replicated the effects of history versus modern information, and showed that history and (to a lesser extent) modern information each yielded more reparative policy support than the control condition. These findings support critical history’s utility in education.",

          "abstract": "Intergroup biases perpetuate social inequality. Bias regulation can be a useful process to set, strive toward, and evaluate progress in relation to bias regulation goals. While previous work on bias regulation has demonstrated that individuals can regulate their biases in intergroup contexts, research has yet to explore the specific strategies that individuals use to do so. To capture a range of bias regulation strategies, we introduce an adapted and expanded measure of emotion regulation to the context of bias regulation, referred to as the Intergroup Bias Regulation Questionnaire (IBRQ). Across two studies, we validate this new measure of bias regulation and aim to understand some of the relevant correlates of bias regulation strategies, such as personality, identity, and other intergroup processes. This new measurement tool offers critical insight into how people report regulating intergroup bias. Importantly, this process can be consequential since some approaches can be more harmful than others. Understanding how individuals approach bias regulation can inform future bias regulation intervention recommendations.",

          "abstract": "What is worse—torturing an animal or killing it? What about humans? In three studies ( n = 472), torturing animals was perceived as worse than killing, but this was significantly reduced or reversed for humans. This was partially explained by mind-perception (agency or experience), and also by an aversion to the loss of human lives over and above this (speciesism). Study 1 provided evidence that the moral wrongness of torturing a hypothetical animal was worse than killing, but killing was worse for human targets. Study 2 partially replicated and extended these results across different species. Ratings were predicted by mind perception, and speciesist preference to avoid human death. Study 3 used pairs of species, separating torture and killing judgments, showing that while speciesism is important for explaining the greater weight people place on human lives, it played a smaller role in judgments about suffering after accounting for mind-perception.",

          "abstract": "In a world marked by persistent uncertainty, accurately predicting the future is vital. While certain people (“superforecasters”) and practices (aggregation) can produce more accurate forecasts, the utility of these forecasts depends on whether they are persuasive enough to be heeded. This study investigates the relationship between persuasion and accuracy in geopolitical forecasts. In a forecasting competition, 153 forecasters predicted future global events and explained their rationales. Next, 474 evaluators rated these rationales for persuasiveness. Using a neural network–based language model, we found that although forecasting rationales contained valid cues for accuracy, evaluators were no more persuaded by accurate forecasts. Further analyses using large language models revealed that psychological attributes indicating expertise, trustworthiness, and emotional composure were associated with both persuasion and accuracy, while eloquence and confidence, though persuasive, were unrelated to accuracy. We conclude that people are sensitive to valid cues, but are misled by invalid ones, impairing overall calibration.",

When listening to their partner’s problems, participants who saw the world as Enticing (i.e., full of rewards and worth exploring) were more responsive to their partner’s bids for support. When discussing their problems, participants who saw the world as generally Good and Enticing perceived that their partner was more supportive, which predicted more positive mood at the end of the conversation and greater well-being a year later. These results provide novel evidence for behavioral and interpretive functions of world beliefs in the context of social support interactions and suggest that world beliefs may influence affective experience and well-being through their impact on support perceptions.",

Those induced to feel grateful toward the experimenter were more likely to obey a command to disregard their actual score and report an inflated score to secure the reward. The effect was not observed when the benefit arose from a positive chance event (Study 1) and appeared to be driven by the need to maintain social harmony (Study 2).

Participants reported lower autonomy when socially interacting compared with being alone. This was especially true for people with higher levels of attachment avoidance. Crucially, interaction partner matters: Compared with being alone, people report lower autonomy when interacting with non-close others, similar levels of autonomy when interacting with friends and family, and higher autonomy when interacting with romantic partners. These findings provide ecologically valid evidence for an autonomy–relatedness tradeoff during social interactions with non-close others but show that interactions with romantic partners uniquely fulfill both autonomy and relatedness needs.",

However, many measures of religious/spiritual constructs are often within explicitly religious contexts, limiting the conceptualization of links between spiritual connection and well-being among nonreligious individuals. The present study employs a novel, versatile measure assessing how frequently individuals feel connected to a religion or form of spirituality. Using nationally representative 2021 Gallup World Poll data from 121 countries ( N = 125,843), we describe the distribution of religious/spiritual connection and examine its associations with subjective well-being among religious and nonreligious individuals. A majority of individuals worldwide—including many who are nonreligious—reported “often/always” feeling religious/spiritual connection. Adjusting for relevant covariates, religious/spiritual connection associated positively with subjective well-being in the global sample of religious individuals and, in some countries, nonreligious individuals (effect sizes were mostly small). Cross-national variation points to the complex role of religious/spiritual connection in shaping subjective well-being globally.",

          "abstract": "The trans-panic legal defense justifies violence against transgender individuals due to defendants’ alleged panic upon learning someone’s transgender identity. Perceived deception and one’s ability to present as the gender with which they identify are drivers of intergroup hostility between transgender and cisgender individuals. Based on expectancy violations theory, we conducted two experiments (Experiment 1, N = 808; Experiment 2, N = 1,006) that examined defendant- and victim-oriented consequences of passing status and the trans-panic defense. We found partial support for our predictions: poorer victim-oriented outcomes (e.g., victim blame) and more positive defendant-oriented outcomes (e.g., fewer guilty verdicts, more lenient sentencing) occurred for passing versus non-passing transgender (Experiments 1-2) and cisgender victims (Experiment 2) through increases in perceived deception and moral outrage (Experiment 2). Our findings underscore implications for how transphobia proliferates.",

          "authors": "Isabella L Ramirez, Laura M Getz",
          "abstract": "Mnemonic devices paired with a musical melody have long been used as memory aids. Although this perceived phenomenon has been recognized in previous studies, research is mixed on the effectiveness of utilizing music to improve learning and memory. In this study, we tested the effects of unfamiliar and familiar melodies on the memorization of unrelated word lists compared with a spoken control condition. Participants heard word lists with two-syllable words of mixed positive, negative, and neutral valence either spoken, sung to a familiar melody (e.g. Yankee Doodle ), or sung to an unfamiliar melody. After hearing each list, they were asked to freely recall the words in any order and were then asked to complete an old–new recognition task. In two experiments, we found spoken text to outperform (Experiment 1 recall and recognition, Experiment 2 recognition) or equal (Experiment 2 recall) the various sung text conditions. These results indicate that regardless of familiarity, melodies may be more distracting on initial presentation, due to working memory capacity limits. Our results thus suggest that at least for short-term recall of unrelated word lists, the colloquial belief of music aiding memory does not hold true.",

          "abstract": "Efforts aimed at measuring health literacy among musicians are very recent. A better understanding of musicians’ health literacy can help educators, health professionals, organisations and relevant specialists address the needs of musicians more specifically. The aim was to assess scale reliability and model fit of the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ) on a sample of UK-based musicians. We conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test the model and calculated Cronbach’s alpha scores for internal consistency and mean scores for the nine scales. Demographic information was obtained from 471 respondents aged 19–78 years ( M = 34, SD = 14). Subsequent to some slight amendments, a modified 8-factor model showed an improved and acceptable fit. This is the first study to investigate musicians’ health literacy using an already existing tool.",

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether groove could enhance motor control when playing multi-limb rhythmic patterns on the drum set. In a within-subjects experimental design, 20 collegiate music majors performed rhythms using the left hand/snare drum and right foot/bass drum on an electronic drum set in three conditions: Isochronous Mmetronome, High-groove, and Low-groove accompaniments—which were 16 beat excerpts of popular songs drawn from an empirically-derived list ranked according to “grooviness.” The rhythms were performed with each accompaniment with Foot, Hand, and Foot and Hand together. Participants also rated their familiarity, enjoyment, perceptions of grooviness, and degree to which they felt “in the groove” after playing with each accompaniment. Analyses revealed that performance accuracy varied as a function of groove condition and effector condition, such that (a) Hand-only and Hand and Foot trials were very close to synchrony, whereas Foot-only trials were early, and (b) High-Groove and Metronome trials were close to the beat, whereas Low-Groove trials were late. Analyses also indicated that performance consistency varied as a function of Effector condition such that Hand-only trials had the least variability in onset asynchronies.",

          "abstract": "Music and empathy are intrinsically linked, both fostering communication. Research has shown that music serves as a nonverbal medium for mutual understanding and synchronization and that musical training and music-induced emotions correlate with empathy skills. In this study, we explored if musical sophistication and musical engagement can be predictors of the four Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) empathy subcomponents (i.e., Personal Distress, Perspective Taking, Empathic Concern, and Fantasy Scale), also in relation to gender and the musical cultural environment. We compared two samples of Italian (from Bari, Apulia; N = 260) and Spanish (from Valencian Community; N = 94) preadolescents (aged 10–14) of Italian music middle schools or Spanish extracurricular music schools of marching bands. Results showed positive, significant relationships of musical sophistication with all empathy subscales except for Personal Distress in both samples. For musical engagement, the two countries again reported similar results with some nuanced differences possibly due to the features of the two different types of training. In addition, in both samples, females displayed higher scores than males in all empathy domains. These findings suggest the importance of promoting music in preadolescence and the strong link between music and empathy traits regardless of context.",
