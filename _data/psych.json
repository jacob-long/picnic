          "authors": "Caitlin A. Howlett, G. Lorimer Moseley",
          "abstract": "The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) is a popular neuropsychological test that is complicated to score and interpret. In an attempt to make scoring of the WCST simpler, Berry (The Clinical Neuropsychologist 10, 117–121, 1996) developed a diagrammatic scoring procedure, particularly to aid scoring of perseverative responses. We identified key limitations of Berry’s diagram, including its unnecessary ambiguity and complexity, use of terminology different from that used in the standardized WCST manual, and lack of distinction between perseverative errors and perseverative responses. Our new diagrammatic scoring procedure scores each response one-by-one; we strongly suggest that the diagram is used in conjunction with the 1993 WCST manual. Our new diagrammatic scoring procedure aims to assist novice users in learning how to accurately score the task, prevent scoring errors when using the manual version of the task, and help scorers verify whether other existing computerized versions of the task (apart from the PAR version) conform to the Heaton et al. (1993) scoring method. Our diagrammatic scoring procedure holds promise to be incorporated into any future versions of the WCST manual.",

          "abstract": "Little attention has been given to self-objectification, which refers to viewing oneself as an instrument or object rather than a full human, in an educational context. To address this gap, the current research aims to test self-objectification among students, and we hypothesized that a performance goal orientation would result in self-objectification (H1), which would further predict reduced authenticity (H2). Six studies (N = 1,716) confirmed our hypotheses. Studies 1–2, employing cross-sectional and 2-wave designs, found a positive association between a performance goal orientation and self-objectification among college students. Study 3 further showed the link among middle school students (i.e., adolescents). Studies 4–5b employed experimental methodologies to demonstrate the causal relationship between the performance goal orientation and self-objectification. In addition, increased self-objectification triggered by the performance goal orientation was further related to reduced authenticity (Studies 3–5b). This work advances the understanding of self-objectification in the educational domain.",

          "authors": "Manuel J. Galvan, Gabriella M. Alvarez, William Cipolli, Erin Cooley, Keely A. Muscatell, B. Keith Payne",
          "abstract": "Is anti-Black discrimination concentrated among a discriminatory few, or widespread across many decision-makers? The handful of studies that have addressed this question have reached divergent conclusions, with some suggesting that discrimination follows the 80/20 rule (i.e., a Pareto distribution) and others suggesting that discrimination is normally distributed. This paper explores the distribution of discrimination in hiring, housing, and judicial decisions. Study 1 examined the distribution of anti-Black discrimination in judges’ repeated sentencing decisions. The distribution of discrimination was more consistent with a normal distribution than a Pareto distribution. In Study 2, meta-analyses of hiring and housing field experiments revealed anti-Black discrimination in more than 80% of studies. Simulations of widespread discrimination using a normal distribution were more consistent with these experimental data than were simulations of concentrated discrimination using a Pareto distribution. These findings suggest that discrimination is not concentrated in the behaviors of a few highly biased individuals.",

          "abstract": "Progress toward racial equality over the course of U.S. history has not been linear, and reductions in racial inequalities have historically been met with racist backlash. In the current research, we examine whether shifts in racial inequalities in key structural areas in recent decades can be used to predict implicit and explicit racial attitudes among White U.S. residents ( N = 222,203). Consistent with the hypothesis that increasing racial equality is threatening, the majority of the statistically significant effects we observed indicated increased pro-White attitudes among White residents of states where racial inequalities decreased over time. State-level reductions in racial inequalities related to government assistance and employment—which have both been highly politicized—were predictive of greater pro-White attitudes among White U.S. residents. Overall, the current findings provide suggestive evidence that reductions in state-level racial inequalities may threaten the status quo, heightening pro-White attitudes among White U.S. residents.",

We collected high-powered three-wave longitudinal and cross-sectional data from a wide age range of participants ( Ns = 3,012 American couples aged 26–96 and 2,307 Japanese couples aged 24–76) and assessed a variety of well-being measures. Study 1 replicated previous findings that American spouses’ well-being was positively associated with each other. Studies 2a and 2b generalized the findings of Study 1 to Japanese spouses. Both Studies 1 and 2b showed conflicting results: There were effects of mutual influence and shared environmental factors’ influences on American and Japanese spouses’ well-being in a longitudinal actor-partner interdependence model when using the cross-lagged panel model, but not when using the random intercept cross-lagged panel model. These findings illustrate that the interdependent nature of well-being is an essential feature of American and Japanese married couples.",

          "abstract": "The process model of patience attempts to reconcile disparate approaches to understanding patience. This investigation provides an initial test of the tenets of this new theoretical model, which positions impatience as a discrete emotion and patience as a targeted form of emotion regulation. In three studies with diverse samples ( N = 1,401; data collected 2022–2023), participants responded to hypothetical scenarios designed to tap into familiar experiences of impatience. Regarding impatience, findings support our claim that impatience arises in response to the perception that a delay is unreasonable or unfair, and situational and intrapersonal characteristics emerged as predictors of impatience. Regarding patience, findings were consistent with the conceptualization of patience as driven more by intrapersonal than situational factors and revealed a set of individual differences that predicted patience. This investigation lends support to the process model of patience as a viable approach, generative of testable research questions, with implications for well-being.",

          "abstract": "Two implicit propositional measures designed to detect faking in personality-related scales were tested across four experimental studies. Study 1 (n = 116) included the Deception Relational Responding Task and Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry Questionnaire as the faking-detector and target scale, respectively. Respondents were randomly assigned to faking or no-faking conditions. Faking respondents were instructed to appear opposite to their narcissistic profile, while no-faking had to respond honestly. In Study 2 (n = 133), the faking-detector was the Deception Implicit Association Test (Dec-aIAT), while the target scale and faking/no-faking instructions remained the same. In Studies 3 (n = 74) and 4 (n = 111), the faking-detector was again the Dec-aIAT, while the target scale was the Big Five Questionnaire-2. Faking respondents had to adhere to a desirable target profile (Study 3; faking-good) or its opposite (Study 4; faking-bad) while no-faking should respond honestly. Overall, the implicit measures showed adequate-to-excellent reliability, discriminating power, and classification accuracy.",

          "abstract": "Sacrificing a target to save a group violates deontological ethics against harm but upholds utilitarian ethics to maximize outcomes. Although theorists examine many factors that influence dilemma decisions, we examined justice concerns: We manipulated the moral character of sacrificial targets, then measured participants’ dilemma responses and just world beliefs. Across four studies ( N=1116), participants considering guilty versus innocent targets scored lower on harm-rejection (deontological) responding, but not outcome-maximizing (utilitarian) responding assessed via process dissociation. Just world beliefs (both personal and general) predicted lower utilitarian and somewhat lower deontological responding, but these effects disappeared when accounting for shared variance with psychopathy. Results suggest that dilemma decisions partly reflect the moral status of sacrificial targets and concerns about the fairness implications of sacrificing innocent targets to save innocent groups.",

          "abstract": "Using data from Project Implicit collected between 2005 and 2020, comprising 1,489,721 observations in 111 countries, we find that implicit and explicit gender stereotypes about career and family are more pronounced in more economically developed countries. Besides, these gender stereotypes are strongly correlated at the country level with gender differences in values (such as family values), self-reported personality traits (such as agreeableness or dependence), and occupational preferences (such as health-related occupations), and may account for the fact that these gender imbalances are “paradoxically” stronger in more economically developed countries (the so-called “gender equality paradox”). In line with social role theory, our findings suggest that there are in developed countries strong gender stereotypes about career and family, which may at least partly explain the persistence or even the “paradoxical worsening” of a number of gender differences in these countries, despite generally high levels of gender equality in other areas.",

          "authors": "Jungmin Choi, Melody M. Chao",
          "abstract": "Public reactions to algorithmic decisions often diverge. While high-profile media coverage suggests that the use of AI in organizational decision-making is viewed as unfair and received negatively, recent survey results suggest that such use of AI is perceived as fair and received positively. Drawing on fairness heuristic theory, the current research reconciles this apparent contradiction by examining the roles of decision outcome and fairness perception on individuals’ attitudinal (Studies 1–3, 5) and behavioral (Study 4) reactions to algorithmic (vs. human) decisions. Results from six experiments (N = 2,794) showed that when the decision was unfavorable, AI was perceived as fairer than human, leading to a less negative reaction. This heightened fairness perception toward AI is shaped by its perceived unemotionality. Furthermore, reminders about the potential biases of AI in decision-making attenuate the differential fairness perception between AI and human. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Humans build mental models of the world and utilize them for various cognitive tasks. The exact form of cognitive maps is not fully understood, especially for novel and complex environments beyond the flat Euclidean environment. To address this gap, we investigated path integration—a critical process underlying cognitive mapping—and spatial-memory capacity on the spherical (non-Euclidean) and planar (Euclidean) environments in young healthy adults ( N = 20) using immersive virtual reality. We observed a strong Euclidean bias during the path-integration task on the spherical surface, even among participants who possessed knowledge of non-Euclidean geometry. Notably, despite this bias, participants demonstrated reasonable navigation ability on the sphere. This observation and simulation suggest that humans navigate nonflat surfaces by constructing locally confined Euclidean maps and flexibly combining them. This insight sheds light on potential neural mechanisms and behavioral strategies for solving complex cognitive tasks.",

We surveyed undergraduate music majors within a single music program and completed purposeful and targeted follow-up interviews of selected respondents who represented a diverse cross-section of the student body. Quantitative analysis included descriptive demographic statistics and linear multiple regression with belonging as the dependent factor. There was a statistically significant relationship between faculty interactions and student sense of belonging ( p &lt; .001). Qualitative findings suggested that student–faculty interactions were a primary contributor to a student’s sense of belonging, as well as the importance of a network of friends and the overall school culture.

          "abstract": "We present a novel framework for music and emotion research that addresses emotional experiences with music as functional episodes. This framework, called the Episode Model, places the situation and the function of the music for the individual at the centre of the experience and integrates acts of affective self-regulation to our understanding of music as emotional experiences. The model consists of a set of five common and functionally unique episodes of emotional experiences related to music, which are: (1) Enjoyment–Distraction–Relaxation (EDR), (2) Connection–Belonging (CB), (3) Focus–Motivation (FM), (4) Personal Emotional Processing (PEP), and (5) Aesthetic–Interest–Awe (AIA). Each episode type can be characterised by a distinct configuration of six descriptive schemes: (1) core affect and emotion qualia, (2) induction mechanisms, (3) listening modes and agency, (4) reward and exposure, (5) musical meanings, and (6) functional contexts. This framework of episodes and schemes places the functionality of emotions at the forefront of music and emotion research and explains how emotional experiences are situated and functionally constructed. In addition, we provide a set of assumptions and specific predictions to facilitate focussed empirical studies of emotional engagement with music.",
