          "authors": "Alexander P. Christensen, Hudson Golino, Francisco J. Abad, Luis Eduardo Garrido",
          "abstract": "Psychometric assessment is the foundation of psychological research, where the accuracy of outcomes and their interpretations depend on measurement. Due to the widespread application of factor models, factor loadings are fundamental to modern psychometric assessment. Recent advances in network psychometrics introduced network loadings which aim to provide network models with a metric similar to factor loadings to assess measurement quality when the data are generated from a factor model. Our study revisits and refines the original network loadings to account for properties of (regularized) partial correlation networks, such as the reduction of partial correlation size as the number of variables increase, that were not considered previously. Using a simulation study, the revised network loadings demonstrated greater congruence with the simulated factor loadings across conditions relative to the original formulation. The simulation also evaluated how well correlations between factors can be captured by scores estimated with network loadings. The results show that not only can these network scores adequately estimate the simulated correlations between factors, they can do so without the need for rotation, a standard requirement for factor loadings. The consequence is that researchers do not need to choose a rotation with the revised network loadings, reducing the analytic degrees of freedom and eliminating this common source of variability in factor analysis. We discuss the interpretation of network loadings when data are believed to be generated from a network model and how they may fit into a network theory of measurement.",

          "authors": "Desirée Blázquez-Rincón, José Antonio López-López, Wolfgang Viechtbauer",
          "abstract": "Location-scale models in the field of meta-analysis allow researchers to simultaneously study the influence of moderator variables on the mean (location) and variance (scale) of the distribution of true effects. However, the increased complexity of such models can make model fitting challenging. Moreover, the statistical properties of the estimation and inference methods for such models have not been systematically examined in the meta-analytic context. We therefore conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study to compare different estimation methods (maximum or restricted maximum likelihood estimation), significance tests (Wald-type, permutation, and likelihood-ratio tests), and methods for constructing confidence intervals (Wald-type and profile-likelihood intervals) for the scale coefficients of such models. When restricted maximum likelihood estimation was used, slightly closer to nominal rejection rates and narrower confidence intervals were obtained. The permutation test yielded type I error rates closest to the nominal level, whereas the likelihood-ratio test obtained the highest statistical power. In most scenarios, profile-likelihood intervals showed lower coverage probabilities than the Wald-type method but closer to the nominal 95% level. Finally, slightly higher rejection rates and coverage probabilities were obtained when a dichotomous moderator was examined rather than a continuous one. Despite the need to use some constraints on the parameter space for the scale coefficients and the possibility of non-convergence of some procedures that may affect the fitting of the specified models, location-scale models proved to be a valid and useful tool for modeling the heterogeneity parameter in meta-analysis.",

          "authors": "Yury Shevchenko, Ulf-Dietrich Reips",
          "abstract": "This manuscript introduces a novel method for conducting behavioral and social research by streaming real-time information to participants and manipulating content for experimental purposes via AI. We present an extension of the Samply software, which facilitates the integration of event-related data with mobile surveys and experiments. To assess the feasibility of this method, we conducted an experiment where news headlines were modified by a Chat-GPT algorithm and streamed to participants via the Samply Stream API and mobile push notifications. Feedback from participants indicated that most did not experience technical problems. There was no significant difference in readability across original, paraphrased, and misinformation-injected news conditions, with only 1.2% of all news items reported as unreadable. Participants reported significantly less familiarity with misinformation-injected news (84% unfamiliarity) compared to original and paraphrased news (73% unfamiliarity), suggesting successful manipulation of information without compromising readability. Dropout and non-response rates were comparable to those in other experience sampling studies. The streaming method offers significant potential for various applications, including public opinion research, healthcare, marketing, and environmental monitoring. By enabling the real-time collection of contextually relevant data, this method has the potential to enhance the external validity of behavioral research and provides a powerful tool for studying human behavior in naturalistic settings.",

          "authors": "Christoph Redies, Ralf Bartho, Lisa Koßmann, Branka Spehar, Ronald Hübner, Johan Wagemans, Gregor U. Hayn-Leichsenring",
          "abstract": "Over the past two decades, researchers in the field of visual aesthetics have studied numerous quantitative (objective) image properties and how they relate to visual aesthetic appreciation. However, results are difficult to compare between research groups. One reason is that researchers use different sets of image properties in their studies. However, even if the same properties are used, the image pre-processing techniques may differ, and researchers often use their own customized scripts to calculate the image properties. To provide better accessibility and comparability of research results in visual experimental aesthetics, we developed an open-access and easy-to-use toolbox called Aesthetics Toolbox . The Toolbox allows users to calculate a well-defined set of quantitative image properties popular in contemporary research. The properties include image dimensions, lightness and color statistics, complexity, symmetry, balance, Fourier spectrum properties, fractal dimension, self-similarity, as well as entropy measures and CNN-based variances. Compatible with most devices, the Toolbox provides an intuitive click-and-drop web interface. In the Toolbox, we integrated the original scripts of four different research groups and translated them into Python 3. To ensure that results were consistent across analyses, we took care that results from the Python versions of the scripts were the same as those from the original scripts. The toolbox, detailed documentation, and a link to the cloud version are available via GitHub: https://github.com/RBartho/Aesthetics-Toolbox . In summary, we developed a toolbox that helps to standardize and simplify the calculation of quantitative image properties for visual aesthetics research.",

          "abstract": "The use of virtual and online tools has become commonplace in organizations to remain competitive in a global and dynamic environment. To understand the impact of these tools on team performance, we examine virtuality through a dynamic lens and test a model that links two team characteristics—virtuality and team density—to team performance across performance episodes. Using data from 36 temporary graduate student teams in a classroom setting, random coefficient growth modeling shows that team density attenuates the negative relationship between virtuality and team performance more strongly over time. Our findings highlight the importance of using a dynamic approach to understand how virtuality and team density affect team performance over time. We discuss the theoretical implications of conceptualizing virtuality from a time-sensitive perspective.",

          "abstract": "This research integrates social judgement and social identity theories to examine evaluations of defensive (narcissistic) and secure social identity (vs. lack of identification) expressed by targets with varying group statuses (advantaged vs. disadvantaged). Across three studies (total N = 2,915), we manipulated target group status and forms of identity. In socioeconomic groups (Study 1), an advantaged target with a defensive identity was deemed assertive, while a disadvantaged counterpart was perceived as moral. Unexpectedly, in ethnocultural groups (Studies 2–3), the disadvantaged target expressing a defensive identity was judged equally or more assertive than the advantaged target. Notably, defensive identity from a disadvantaged target consistently garnered higher moral judgement than from an advantaged target. These results highlight that defensive identity can receive positive evaluations and confer elevated status. Nonetheless, we observed differential evaluation strategies depending on intergroup settings, suggesting system justification in socioeconomic groups versus ingroup favouritism in U.S. ethnic groups.",

          "abstract": "A popular intervention for increasing support for peace in violent intergroup conflicts is to describe the peaceful resolution of other conflicts. In four experiments, we tested the effectiveness of this approach in the context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict by exposing Jewish-Israelis to information about the Northern Ireland conflict and peace process, or about tourism in Northern Ireland as a control. We found that learning about the historical peace process generally led participants to view conflicts as more malleable, their own conflict as less unique, and led to unfreezing of conflict-related beliefs. However, it neither increased hope nor consistently boosted support for conciliatory policies. We explored boundary conditions and found effects were often stronger among leftist and centrist compared with rightists. Moreover, explicitly drawing analogies between conflicts at the outset proved ineffective, whereas exposing participants to the historical conflict and peace process without mentioning the proximal conflict was more successful.",

          "abstract": "Over the last two decades, much of management research has converged on the belief that one of its major aims is to identify the causal mechanisms that produce the phenomena that researchers seek to explain. In this paper, we review and synthesize the literature that has amassed around causal mechanisms. We do so by detailing the different methodological perspectives that are featured in management research, which we label as the contextual, constitutive, and interventionist perspectives. For each of these perspectives, we examine what it theoretically presupposes a mechanism to be, how this connects to methodological choices, and how this shapes the kind of mechanism-based explanations that each perspective offers. We also explore the main inferential challenges for each of these perspectives and offer specific methodological guidance in response. In this way, we aim to offer a common plank for theorizing and research on causal mechanisms in ways that recognize and harness the productive differences across different epistemologies and methodological traditions.",

          "authors": "Yucheng Zhang, Yuyan Zheng, Dan Wang, Xiaowei Gu, Michael J. Zyphur, Lin Xiao, Shudi Liao, Yangyang Deng",
          "abstract": "In contemporary organizational research, when dealing with large heterogeneous datasets and complex relationships, statistical modeling focused on developing substantive explanations typically results in low predictive accuracy. In contrast, machine learning (ML) exhibits remarkable strength for prediction, but suffers from an unexplainable analytical process and output—thus ML is often known as a “black box” approach. The recent development of explainable machine learning (XML) integrates high predictive accuracy with explainability, which combines the advantages inherent in both statistical modeling and ML paradigms. This paper compares XML with statistical modeling and the traditional ML approaches, focusing on an advanced application of XML known as evolving fuzzy system (EFS), which enhances model transparency by clarifying the unique contribution of each modeled predictor. In an illustrative study, we demonstrate two EFS-based XML models and conduct comparative analyses among XML, ML, and statistical models with a commonly-used database in organizational research. Our study offers a thorough description of analysis procedures for implementing XML in organizational research, along with best-practice recommendations for each step as well as Python code to aid future research using XML. Finally, we discuss the benefits of XML for organizational research and its potential development.",

          "abstract": "Dispositional greed is characterized as the insatiable desire for more. Although greed may be a driving force for wealth accumulation, it can also relate to increased financial difficulties and risk-taking. Across two studies in different countries, The Netherlands (Study 1, N = 1,118) and England, Study 2, N = 4,855), we tested the degree to which dispositional greed was associated with gambling outcomes. Greedy individuals reported greater gambling participation and more negative gambling-related consequences. Moreover, Study 2 found that greed was associated with maladaptive gambling-related cognitions (e.g., cognitive distortions, positive expectations, and the perceived inability to stop) beyond that explained by trait motor impulsiveness. In addition, dispositionally greedy individuals reported being more focused on financial motivations for gambling, having greater confidence in winning, and less concern with realized losses. The current study demonstrates links between dispositional greed and risk-taking in a real-world context, highlighting biased decision-making cognitions for greedy individuals.",

          "abstract": "People who are stigmatized along concealable features (e.g., individuals reporting adverse childhood experiences) often experience challenges to the self-concept, which can promote psychological distress. Developing a stigmatized identity might counter these effects, but the internality of concealable features can forestall this process: individuals may look to similarly-stigmatized others, but if these group members remain concealed (i.e., are not “out”), they are less identifiable as guides for development. In two studies ( N total = 845), less outness among similarly-stigmatized others in the social environment predicted increased distress—but only for individuals reporting low progress in processes of positive meaning-making (Studies 1 and 2) and exploration (Study 2). The interaction held when controlling for stigmatizing views endorsed by non-stigmatized counterparts (Study 2). Findings highlight similarly-stigmatized others as important constituents of the social environment: low group visibility and accessibility may uniquely contribute to distress for individuals at early phases of developing a positive and clear stigmatized identity.",

          "abstract": "Automatic evaluation has emerged as a central concept in contemporary thinking about prejudice. The current research tested a quintessential aspect of prejudice: whether group affiliation dominates the automatic evaluation of individual group members even when diagnostic evaluative information about the individuals is available. Participants read a list of descriptions about the behaviors of two individuals: one from a typically liked group and one from a typically disliked group. The list portrayed one individual more positively than the other, and we manipulated the extremity and direction of that difference. We conducted six studies ( N = 11,572) with samples consisting of U.S. adults across different regions and group types (age, gender, and race) and two indirect measures that purportedly measure automatic evaluation: the implicit association test (IAT) and the evaluative priming task (EPT). Group affiliation (relative to personal characteristics) influenced the IAT and the EPT more than it influenced the self-reported evaluation. These results may suggest that the automatic evaluation of individuals is more prejudiced than nonautomatic evaluation.",
