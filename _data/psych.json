          "abstract": "Cross-cultural studies are crucial for investigating the cultural variability and universality of cognitive developmental processes. However, cross-cultural assessment tools in cognition across languages and communities are limited. In this article, we describe a gaze-following task designed to measure basic social cognition across individuals, ages, and communities (the Task for Assessing iNdividual differences in Gaze understanding-Open-Cross-Cultural; TANGO-CC). The task was developed and psychometrically assessed in one cultural setting and, with input of local collaborators, adapted for cross-cultural data collection. Minimal language demands and the web-app implementation allow fast and easy contextual adaptations to each community. TANGO-CC captures individual- and community-level variation and shows good internal consistency in a data set of 2.5- to 11-year-old children from 17 diverse communities. Within-communities variation outweighed between-communities variation. We provide an open-source website for researchers to customize and use the task ( https://ccp-odc.eva.mpg.de/tango-cc ). TANGO-CC can be used to assess basic social cognition in diverse communities and provides a roadmap for researching community-level and individual-level differences across cultures.",

          "abstract": "The use of ecological-momentary-assessment (EMA) data to study individuals in their everyday lives is popular in many areas of social and life sciences. At the same time, EMA data sets are complex, the psychometric properties of EMA items are often not investigated systematically, and scales are often neither standardized nor validated beyond their face validity. Here, we present different descriptive statistics and data-visualization techniques to increase the understanding of the performance of EMA items. We apply these techniques to a wide range of items used in a large EMA data set (599 participants, 360 time points) collected in the WARN-D study to investigate their distributions, contextual influences, change over time, sources of variability, and relationship with classical static measures of psychopathology. We discuss the theoretical and substantive implications of our findings and provide researchers with R code that they can adapt to their own EMA data, as well as literature recommendations for each topic. We hope to inspire more researchers to share in-depth descriptive summaries of their experience-sampling data such that the field can move forward in understanding the performance of EMA measures across contexts.",

          "authors": "E. B. Gross, Susan A. Gelman",
          "abstract": "Although psychological research often relies on convenience samples, the most informative participants may be individuals who are reluctant to engage because of vulnerability, mistrust of the research process, and/or disagreement with a study’s goals. Although this concern is particularly urgent for certain research questions, it is relevant for all researchers because relying solely on easy-to-reach participants limits a study’s validity and generalizability and may substantially hollow out or even render unanswerable some research questions. We review a number of challenges for conducting research with “reluctant but informative” participants and strategies to meet and overcome these challenges. We argue that engaging reluctant participants requires attention at every phase of the research process, including study design and planning, participant recruitment and testing, data analysis and interpretation, and reporting and broader impacts. We also illustrate with our own recent experiences conducting research on children’s gender concepts in rural, conservative U.S. communities that expressed skepticism about the value of this research. Although every study is different, notable across all projects are the need to respect both individual participants and their communities and to balance competing desiderata. Finally, we discuss the importance of transparency around sample composition and constraints to generalizability and the potential utility of collaborative research both across research institutions and between researchers and participant communities.",

          "abstract": "Interaction effects are very common in the psychological literature. However, interaction effects are typically very small and often fail to replicate. In this study, we conducted a simulation comparing the generalizability and estimability of two linear regression models: one correctly specified to account for interaction effects and one misspecified including simple effects only. We manipulated noise levels, predictor variable correlations, and different sets of regression weights, resulting in 9216 different conditions. From each dataset, we drew 1000 samples of N = 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000, resulting in a total of 55,296,000 analyses for each model. Our results show that misspecification can drastically bias regression estimates, sometimes leading to zero or reversed simple effects. Furthermore, we found that when models are generalized to the entire population, the difference between the explained variance in the sample and in the population is often smaller for the misspecified model than for the correctly specified model. However, the comparison between models shows that the correctly specified model explains the data at the population level better overall. These results emphasize the importance of theory in modeling choices and show that it is important to provide a rationale for why interactions are included or excluded in an analysis.",

          "abstract": "In four cross-sectional studies ( N = 2,228; three preregistered), we hypothesized and found that U.S. American and White collective narcissism is associated with opposition to racial equality, whereas racial collective narcissism among Blacks and Latinx in the United States (US) is associated with support for racial equality. In Studies 1 and 2, American national and White racial collective narcissism was positively associated with support for state repression of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, antiegalitarianism, and legitimization of racial inequality. Black racial collective narcissism was negatively associated with the same variables. In Studies 3 and 4, American national and White racial collective narcissism was positively associated with antiegalitarianism, support for the alt-right movement, and opposition to policies to advance racial minorities. Latinx racial collective narcissism was negatively associated with the same variables. In sum, in the US, national collective narcissism among Whites and racial minorities and White racial collective narcissism hinder the pursuit of racial equality. However, Black and Latinx racial collective narcissism is associated with pursuit of racial equality.",

We hypothesized that greater media exposure to the far-right will be associated with greater perceived prevalence and acceptability of it, which will in turn be associated with divergent attitudes. On the one hand, greater perceived prevalence may be associated with more unfavorable attitudes toward the far-right (a threat response). On the other hand, greater perceived acceptability may be associated with more favorable attitudes toward the far-right (a normalization response). Overall, there was more evidence for a threat response than a normalization response: media exposure was consistently related to greater perceived prevalence (but not acceptability) of the far-right. This research underscores the importance of studying the consequences of the rise of the far-right.",

          "abstract": "Research conducted in the United States shows that White Americans form more positive impressions of White than Black interaction partners through instrumental learning. We asked whether this pattern generalizes to the cultural context of the Netherlands, which differs in norms for expressing intergroup bias. In three preregistered studies ( Ns = 66, 83, 80), White Dutch participants played a money-sharing game, based on a reward reinforcement task, with White and Moroccan partners. Although players shared at different rates, average sharing rates for White and Moroccan players were equated. Unexpectedly, and despite anti-Moroccan explicit and implicit attitudes, participants displayed a pro-Moroccan choice preference across studies. Nevertheless, computational modeling indicated the same learning effects of ethnicity as in past research: ethnicity biased initial reward expectations, and these were updated via group-specific learning rates. We discuss potential explanations for this unexpected pattern and broader implications for cross-cultural research on intergroup social cognition.",

The literature suggests contextually different processes by outgroup similarity. Our three-wave longitudinal study is the first piece of STE research that applies random intercept cross-legged panel models to explore this contextuality, tackling several research deficiencies: (a) the overfocus on positive contact, (b) reliance on cross-sectional designs, (c) limited knowledge regarding underlying processes, (d) scarcity of comparative studies investigating mediators or intergroup settings jointly. We study three STE mediators from positive and negative contact (attitude generalization, multiculturalism, primary outgroup threat) across different primary outgroups (Muslims, n = 385; Sinti and Roma, n = 396), keeping contextual setting (Germany), temporal setting (2016–2017), and secondary outgroup (refugees) constant. While between-person rank differences emerged, we found no evidence for the theorized within-person changes over time, and we discuss this in terms of theoretical, methodological, and contextual interpretations.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between work engagement, job satisfaction, turnover intentions, and identity within organisations was investigated. Social identity theory (SIT) proposes that individuals derive part of their self-concept from their group memberships, and previous research has shown that individuals derive a degree of engagement and job satisfaction based on their identification with the organisation where they work. Based on SIT, we propose that identity can be considered a resource in organisations and mediate the relationship between engagement and job satisfaction (Study 1) and turnover intentions (Study 2). Confirming our predictions, group identity, but not organisational identity, was a significant mediator in both studies. The results also showed that organisational identity (the endorsement of the organisation) is relevant but not independently from group identity (the relationships with immediate coworkers). Simply promoting organisational identity has limited effects on the relationship between work engagement and job satisfaction and turnover intentions.",

We then outline future directions for gendered contact research with a focus on (a) assessing interpersonal and intergroup dynamics within cross-gendered relationships; (b) understanding the conditions that facilitate gendered contact that is both harmonious and support social change toward gender equality; and (c) conceptual and methodological considerations necessary to study gendered contact.

In Study 1 ( N = 435), using recalled offenses, we found that higher perceived divine forgiveness was positively associated with self-forgiveness, which in turn was negatively associated with apology behavior. In Study 2 ( N = 531), using recalled offenses and an experimental design, we replicated our findings from Study 1 whereby divine forgiveness (vs. control) promoted greater self-forgiveness, which in turn was negatively associated with apology behavior. However, we found positive indirect effects of divine forgiveness on apology behavior via the serial mediators of gratitude and humility. Together, these studies offer insight into how divine forgiveness can both hinder and encourage transgressors’ constructive responses to conflict through different psychological mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "In recent decades, women’s representation in power positions has increased alongside a global decline in anti-egalitarian biases. These egalitarian shifts provide the ideal context to examine the boundary conditions of the motivators of group-based inequality. Accordingly, we investigate the possibility that rising gender equality over the last 14 years has attenuated the relationship between group-based (anti-)egalitarianism (namely, social dominance orientation) and system justification. A multi-level analysis of longitudinal data from 43,924 women shows that anti-egalitarian beliefs predicted increases in system justification. However as hypothesized, increases in gender equality attenuated the positive correlation between anti-egalitarian beliefs and justification of the status quo. These associations were particularly pronounced among women from majoritized groups who benefit most from gender equality. Results replicate across robustness checks and offer a critical update to our understanding of egalitarianism by showing that egalitarians may engage in system justification when the status quo becomes more equal.",

          "authors": "Selma N. Uugwanga, Luzelle Naudé, Amber Gayle Thalmayer",
          "abstract": "What does it take to become an adult in Africa? Life-span-development literature includes little exploration on this transition outside Western countries. A qualitative approach was used to identify locally relevant topics and variables in an understudied African context. Fifty 18- to 25-year-old Ovambo Namibians from rural and urban areas were interviewed. Results of reflexive thematic analysis suggest the significance of gender and birth order in defining adult roles and the completion of one’s education as a new rite of passage. Full adult personhood means providing for and engaging with a larger community as well as one’s children and extended family, reflecting the ongoing relevance of African communalism in today’s society. Youth in Namibia, and likely in sub-Saharan Africa more broadly, balance traditional and contemporary demands as they come of age in a postindependence, globalizing society. Our findings reflect the centrality of community and the intermingled nature of agentic and communal values in this process.",

          "abstract": "To examine the impact of music as a cross-modal prime on facial emotion recognition ability in autistic children, this study compares the priming effect of music with that of faces as an intramodal prime and nonverbal sounds as the same cross-modal prime. The response time and accuracy of facial emotion recognition (happy and sad) were compared among 21 neurotypical children and 17 autistic children under various priming stimuli. A data analysis revealed that autistic children exhibited worse recognition of facial emotional expressions and demonstrated longer reaction time than neurotypical children. Unlike the other two stimuli (facial expressions and nonverbal sounds), music as a cross-modal prime resulted in slightly higher response accuracy for emotionally congruent conditions compared with emotionally incongruent conditions among autistic children. Furthermore, reaction time was significantly prolonged under emotionally congruent conditions than under emotionally incongruent conditions. This suggests that autistic children demonstrate a greater propensity to allocate additional time to improve the accuracy of their judgments under congruent conditions compared with incongruent conditions. Therefore, music intervention has significant potential for supporting autistic children to empathize with faces by playing emotionally congruent music and improving their facial emotion recognition abilities.",
