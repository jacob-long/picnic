          "authors": "Minyu Chang, C. J. Brainerd, Daniel M. Bialer, Xinya Liu",
          "abstract": "The Deese/Roediger/McDermott (DRM) illusion is one of the most widely used methods for studying false memory. Early studies provided normed false recall and false recognition data for DRM lists, where recognition is preceded by prior recall tests, and reported regression analyses that revealed backward associative strength (BAS) as one of the strongest predictors of false memory. As an extension of that line of research, we collected new recognition norms that are not confounded by prior recall tests and included gist strength (GS) as a theory-driven predictor of false memory. In Study 1, we normed true and false recognition for 55 DRM lists without prior recall tests, and in Study 2, we normed these lists for their perceived levels of gist strength. In Study 3, we fit a series of multiple linear regression models to the recognition data from Study 1 as well as recall and recognition data from prior false memory norms to disentangle the effects of BAS and GS on false recognition (with and without prior recall) and immediate false recall. Our results revealed that levels of true recognition and the recall–recognition correlation were inflated by prior recall tests. More importantly, GS was the strongest predictor of false recognition, whereas BAS was the strongest predictor of immediate false recall. A GS × BAS interaction was consistently observed for false recall and false recognition, in which the effects of BAS declined as GS increased. This suggests that the two variables compete with each other rather than reinforce each other’s effects.",

          "authors": "Marina Rodriguez Lopez, Huaiyu Liu, Federico Mancinelli, Jack Brookes, Dominik R. Bach",
          "abstract": "Avoidance learning encompasses the acquisition of behaviours that enable individuals to evade or withdraw from potentially harmful stimuli, prior to their occurrence. Maladaptive avoidance is a crucial feature of anxiety and trauma-related disorders. In biological and clinical settings, avoidance behaviours usually involve uninstructed, idiosyncratic and complex motor actions. However, there is a lack of laboratory paradigms that allow investigating how such actions are acquired. To fill this gap, we developed a wireless virtual reality platform to investigate avoidance learning in naturalistic settings, with an uncomfortable sound as unconditioned stimulus (US), a physically plausible avoidance action, and allowing for unconstrained movements. This platform, the CogLearn Toolkit for Unity, is publicly available and allows conducting various types of learning experiments with simple text files as input. We validated this platform in an exploration-confirmation approach with five independent experiments. Overall, participants showed successful acquisition of avoidance behaviour in all experiments. In three exploration experiments, we refined the paradigm and identified mean distance from US location during conditioned stimulus (CS) presentation (before US occurs) as a sensitive measure of avoidance. Two confirmation experiments revealed stronger avoidance for CS+ than CS- during avoidance learning, whether or not this phase was preceded by Pavlovian acquisition. Furthermore, we demonstrated reduced avoidance during extinction with instruction to approach CS, but persistent residual avoidance during this phase. We found evidence of reinstatement in one of two confirmation experiments. Overall, our study provides robust evidence supporting the efficacy of our paradigm in studying avoidance learning in conditions of high ecological relevance.",

          "abstract": "Few studies have systematically measured positions about the relationships between science and religion, and existing work has primarily focused on Christian samples from Western cultures. We collected data from individuals living in Australia, China, and the United States, encompassing both adults and undergraduates (total N = 985). We employed existing self-report instruments and novel items to measure positions about science and religion as well as individual attitudes toward science and religion (i.e., not in relation to one another). Exploratory factor and cluster analysis showed that, across samples, position dimensions included multiple facets of compatibility, both in general and specific terms, alongside a single conflict dimension. Correlations and moderated regressions showed that compatibility dimensions corresponded with depolarized attitudes toward science and religion, whereas the conflict dimension correlated with polarized attitudes. These results supported preregistered hypotheses. This study takes a step toward assessing positions more comprehensively, offering insights into their meanings.",

          "authors": "Kathi Diel, Lea Boecker, Jens Lange, Wilhelm Hofmann, Jan Crusius",
          "abstract": "In an experience-sampling study, we examined how emotions stemming from social comparisons influence daily motivation. Analyzing 2,976 daily real-world social comparisons, we examined the interplay of comparison direction (upward vs. downward) and extremity (from moderate to extreme), two pleasant emotions (schadenfreude and happy-for-ness), two unpleasant emotions (benign envy, malicious envy), three motivational tendencies (pushing, coasting, and disengagement), and effort intentions. The relationships between comparison extremity and emotions were characterized by nonlinearity: Benign envy and happy-for-ness peaked with moderate upward comparisons, whereas malicious envy and schadenfreude increased especially with extreme upward and downward comparisons. Concerning motivational functioning, results suggest that benign envy and happy-for-ness promote motivation (i.e., associated with pushing and effort), whereas malicious envy and schadenfreude do not (i.e., linked to disengagement and coasting), with effects contingent on comparison extremity. This work emphasizes how distinct social emotions emerge as a function of social comparison extremity and their dynamic role in everyday motivation.",

          "abstract": "Dating in later life is increasingly prevalent, yet research on older adults’ experiences within their newly formed relationships is scarce. Although older adults are often more adept in minimizing their reactivity when relational tensions arise, integrating insights from theories of aging and relationship development suggests that older adults’ advantage over younger adults may diminish, or even reverse, when examining reactivity in newly formed dating relationships. Married and dating couples ( N = 282; aged 30–88) completed a 21-day daily diary task. Multilevel modeling was used to estimate individuals’ negative affect, physical health symptoms, and relationship satisfaction on days of greater tension with a partner. Age was not associated with reactivity among married couples. Among dating couples, age was associated with emotional reactivity (women only) and physical reactivity, but not relational reactivity, such that older individuals experienced greater increases in emotional distress and physical health problems on higher tension days compared to younger individuals.",

          "abstract": "Very little is known about how long-term well-being trajectories vary across populations. Using data from 45,160 adults in New Zealand (62% women, M age = 41 years) surveyed annually over 13 years, we identified latent trajectories for belongingness, social support, self-esteem, and life satisfaction. Through a group-based trajectory modeling approach, we found five trajectory groups: low (3%–5%), moderate (11%–17%), moderate-high (29%–32%), high (35%–45%), and very high (11%–20%) well-being. While most individuals showed minimal changes, those with initially low well-being experienced the greatest change, in the direction of decreasing well-being over time. Individuals with higher education were more likely to follow higher well-being trajectories. Similarly, women were more likely to follow higher well-being trajectories, except for self-esteem, where men tended to score higher over time. Lastly, age and ethnicity demonstrated more complex patterns. These findings highlight the importance of acknowledging long-term heterogeneity in well-being trajectories and emphasize the need for targeted preventive mental health interventions, particularly for individuals who begin with lower well-being levels.",

          "abstract": "Gratitude is often considered a response to kind acts from others, but growing research suggests it is frequently directed toward God. This study explored how gratitude toward God differs from gratitude toward people. Since God is perceived as all-powerful and not directly benefiting from reciprocation, we hypothesized that individuals would focus less on repaying God and more on paying it forward. We tested this through three studies: a cross-sectional survey (Study 1), a daily diary approach (Study 2), and an experimental design (Study 3). Across studies, gratitude toward God was associated with a greater motivation to pay it forward compared to gratitude toward others, such as close relationships or authority figures. This forward-focused gratitude predicted increased intentions for religious commitment (e.g., prayer), character growth, and prosocial behavior. These effects held even after accounting for motivations to repay God or interhuman gratitude, emphasizing the distinct role of gratitude toward God.",

While recent theorizing posits that reflection is a prerequisite for such change, empirical evidence supporting this is sparse. Here, we investigated the role of reflection in self-concept change after feedback in six studies. In Studies 1a–e (total N = 2,422), participants received feedback regarding a self-concept domain and we assessed reflection as well as self-concept change. Across studies, the amount of reflection was positively correlated with self-concept change. In Study 2 ( N = 1,149), we experimentally varied whether participants were encouraged to reflect on the feedback and their self-concept or prevented from doing so via a distractor task. We found that self-concept change was larger after inducing (vs. suppressing) reflection. Exploratory analyses showed that the association between reflection and self-concept change was more pronounced for negative than for positive feedback in Studies 1a–e, but not Study 2.",

          "abstract": "Black women experience unique stressors and mental health challenges that intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, raising critical questions such as who acts as a trustworthy therapist for Black women and what messaging is most effective for encouraging self-care and therapy. Four experiments with Black U.S. women ( N = 1,961) aimed to answer these questions. Receiving messages from Black (vs. White) sources/therapists led to consistently positive outcomes (e.g., trust, positive attitudes toward mental treatment; Studies 1a–2), particularly among participants high in suspicion of White individuals’ motives. However, a matched gendered source/therapist (i.e., a White woman) produced inconsistently small effects. Although culturally targeted (vs. non-targeted) messages enhanced beliefs that the therapists conveyed allyship, they did not improve trust (Studies 1a–2). Importantly, a message emphasizing the need for policy-level changes sparked trust (Studies 2–3). This work has implications for developing effective ally and health messaging and fostering trust between therapists and Black women.",

          "abstract": "Humans have always found ways to flaunt how they spend money. In studying this conspicuous consumption behavior, researchers have focused almost exclusively on one particular target of consumption—material goods that are bought and physically owned. Here, we propose that a different, understudied target of conspicuous consumption—experiential purchases—offers unique social signaling value compared to material goods. Across experimenter-derived stimuli (Study 1a) and real-world instances of conspicuous consumption scraped from Instagram (Study 1b), we find that conspicuous experiences can convey status equivalently to, while simultaneously signaling warmth better than, conspicuous material purchases. This communal advantage is driven by higher levels of perceived intrinsic motivation afforded to conspicuous experiences (Study 2) and is only present when the experiences are consumed by others (Study 3). These findings broaden our understanding of status-based consumption processes and position conspicuous experiences as signaling tools with unique social features and value.",

          "abstract": "Power emerges from the relational dynamics between two people, but it is often studied as a feature of the individual. The current studies apply a dyadic perspective to show that core relational beliefs not only shape actors’ relationship power but also generate behaviors that constrain their partner’s power. Across five studies with Israeli, German, and New Zealand couples (total 1,256 dyads), greater attachment avoidance and anxiety were associated with lower actor power. Revealing novel dyadic effects, greater attachment avoidance was associated with partner’s experiencing lower power. Studies 4 and 5 showed that actors higher in avoidance enacted greater withdrawal during conflict and daily life as perceived by partners and observed by independent coders. Actors’ withdrawal, in turn, predicted partners experiencing lower power. These findings advance power and relationship theories and research by highlighting how relational characteristics and behaviors (withdrawal) likely shape the experience of both actors’ and partners’ power in social relationships.",

          "abstract": "Price negotiation is often a zero-sum interaction where one party’s gain is another’s loss. In such contexts, a buyer’s willingness to negotiate can depend on the perceived justifiability of negotiation. This research examines how political ideology shapes these perceptions. Two archival studies ( N = 56,615) and four preregistered studies ( N = 3,157) show that conservative buyers are more likely to negotiate prices for houses and used cars. Conservatives also hold stronger beliefs that buyers should negotiate prices regardless of the seller’s identity—be it a professional dealer, an ordinary seller, a stranger, or a friend. This heightened propensity to justify price negotiation is rooted in conservatives’ endorsement of free-market ideology, which motivates and even moralizes the pursuit of economic self-interest in marketplace interactions. These findings offer a nuanced account of interactions in the marketplace, demonstrating that marketplace behaviors are influenced not only by economic considerations but also by ideological beliefs.",

The aim was to validate the 4-CTSQ in a non-U.S./Canadian population, to explore the nomological networks of thinking styles, and to test whether the 4-CTSQ predicts unfounded beliefs over and beyond analytic thinking. The secondary aim was to address the issue of acquiescence linked with the one-directional wording of the items and to develop a balanced version of the 4-CTSQ (4-CTSQ-B). In two studies ( N 1 = 1,233, N 2 = 712), 4-factor models had an acceptable model fit, and both the 4-CTSQ and the 4-CTSQ-B predicted unfounded beliefs. Conceptual and psychometric issues with AOT and CMT were identified and possible solutions were discussed. The 4-CTSQ, and somewhat more so the 4-CTSQ-B, appear to be good scales sensitive to distinct thinking styles.",

We developed a novel framework to categorize rituals based on their instrumental purpose, psychological influence, and symbolic significance. With 93% of participants incorporating rituals into their preparation, these practices range from symbolic actions to direct performance strategies, highlighting a deep engagement with rituals across a spectrum of music disciplines. Our research further explores the development of these rituals through personal experimentation and community influence, emphasizing the critical role of educators and peers in shaping these practices. Group rituals, in particular, strengthen feelings of camaraderie and support among ensemble members, reinforcing the importance of rituals in creating a cohesive and supportive musical community. Our results offer insights for educators to integrate ritualistic practices into teaching strategies to enhance students’ performance, group identity, and psychological well-being.",

Although a broadening demographic indicates growing diversification and inclusivity within club culture, experiences differ between groups and reveal socially constructed norms associated with age and gender. This study investigated older women’s motivations for and experiences of participating in Electronic Dance Music (EDM) and explored how this group sustains and maintains their involvement. One hundred and thirty-six female clubbers aged 40 years or over (age range = 40–65 years) completed a survey. EDM participation played a central role in women’s mental and physical health and provided them with social connectedness, an outlet for self-expression, and a release from pressures of daily life. Despite these positive benefits, participation was not without challenges as women reported navigating other people’s views on what was deemed to be ‘appropriate’ behaviour for older, female clubbers and highlighted grappling with their own prejudices about age. The research identified strategies they use to manage their continued participation in a music scene traditionally associated with youth and considered the extent to which their experiences of ageing affect and shape their involvement.",
