          "authors": "Anja F. Ernst, Jonas M. B. Haslbeck",
          "abstract": "Time-series data have become ubiquitous in psychological research, allowing us to study detailed within-person dynamics and their heterogeneity across persons. Vector autoregressive (VAR) models have become a popular choice as a first approximation of these dynamics. The VAR model for each person and heterogeneity across persons can be jointly modeled using a hierarchical model that treats heterogeneity as a latent distribution. Currently, the most popular choice for this is the multilevel VAR model, which models heterogeneity across persons as quantitative variation through a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Here, we discuss an alternative, the latent class VAR model, which models heterogeneity as qualitative variation using a number of discrete clusters. While this model has been introduced before, it has not been readily accessible to researchers. Here we address this issue by providing an accessible introduction to latent class VAR models; a simulation evaluating how well this model can be estimated in situations resembling applied research; introducing a new R package ClusterVAR , which provides easy-to-use functions to estimate the model; and providing a fully reproducible tutorial on modeling emotion dynamics, which walks the reader through all steps of estimating, analyzing, and interpreting latent class VAR models.",

          "abstract": "Prototypes—internalized knowledge structures of the most typical or characteristic features of a concept—are important because they influence cognitive processing. Yet prototype analysis, the method used to examine prototypes, appears relatively underutilized in organizational research. To introduce prototype analysis to a wider audience of organizational scholars, we conducted a critical methodological literature review following a six-step procedure. Seventy-three prototype analyses published in 35 journals were categorized and their content analyzed. A prototype analysis typically includes a sequence of independent studies conducted over two stages, recently referred to as the standard procedure. Our review makes several contributions, including development of a taxonomy of prototype analysis applications, clarification of the standard procedure of a prototype analysis and possible variations, and suggestions for organizational research. Benefits of undertaking a prototype analysis include improved understanding of abstract workplace concepts that are difficult to measure directly, the ability to compare cross-cultural prototypes, and an approach for investigating the issue of construct redundancy. We conclude with best-practice recommendations, implications for organizational scholarship, methodological limitations, and future research suggestions.",

          "authors": "Silje Steinsbekk, Lars Wichstrøm, Tilmann von Soest",
          "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in personality development in childhood and adolescence. However, population-based longitudinal studies that examine self-reported personality traits and their facets during these critical developmental periods are scarce. Here, we test the disruption hypothesis, which suggests deviations from standard patterns of personality maturation during adolescence in certain personality domains. Our study extends existing knowledge by examining development and sex differences in self-reported conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, and their facets from childhood to adolescence. Utilizing the Big Five Inventory, we collected four waves of personality data (ages 10, 12, 14, and 16 years) from a representative birth cohort of Norwegian children ( N = 805). Our results predominantly support the disruption hypothesis, showing declines in conscientiousness and agreeableness across sexes from age 12, with an increase in neuroticism observed solely for girls. The findings further demonstrate that maturation disruptions vary at the facet level, suggesting a complex developmental process.",

          "abstract": "The adaptation account suggests that the persistence of some traditional values in modern society is due to their enduring adaptive utility. We tested this hypothesis by examining the change of filial piety in two Confucian societies, China and Japan. By analyzing natural language data, Study 1 found that Chinese people’s concern about and liking for filial piety have increased since 1979, with falling birth rate and rising elderly population as the Granger causes. By analyzing survey data from 2006 to 2017 ( N = 7,283) in China, Study 2 found that reciprocal filial piety was adaptive (i.e., conducive to well-being) and increasing, whereas authoritarian filial piety was maladaptive (i.e., detrimental to well-being) and decreasing. By analyzing both Japanese language data from 1989 to 2023 (Study 3a) and survey data from 2006 to 2018 (Study 3b: N = 4,763), Study 3 replicated the main findings from China. These findings support the adaptation account of cultural persistence.",

          "authors": "Shi Yin Chee, Ester Ellen Trees Bolt",
          "abstract": "Aging is a multifaceted, personal experience rather than a one-size-fits-all journey of universal longevity desires. This study explores the lived experiences of older adults in senior living facilities, focusing on their longevity aspirations and the factors shaping them. In-depth, semi-structured interviews with 20 older adults in four Malaysian senior living facilities were analyzed using Husserl’s phenomenology and Giorgi’s descriptive method. Four themes emerged: balancing the desire to live long versus living well, emotional and existential reflections, hidden emotional and physical adaptations, and shifting dynamics of control over priorities and values. Findings reveal that aging is an unpredictable journey, shaped by ambiguities and uncertainties, where fulfillment does not always stem from longevity. Tailored support that honors older adults’ histories, emotions, and aspirations enables aging with dignity and autonomy, guiding providers, policymakers, and caregivers to enhance quality of life to meaningfully enhance quality of life by aligning care with longevity aspirations.",
