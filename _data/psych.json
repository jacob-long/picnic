          "authors": "Julien P. Irmer, Andreas G. Klein, Karin Schermelleh-Engel",
          "abstract": "Closed-form (asymptotic) analytical power estimation is only available for limited classes of models, requiring correct model specification for most applications. Simulation-based power estimation can be applied in almost all scenarios where data following the model can be estimated. However, a general framework for calculating the required sample sizes for given power rates is still lacking. We propose a new model-implied simulation-based power estimation (MSPE) method for the z -test that makes use of the asymptotic normality property of estimates of a wide class of estimators, the M -estimators, and give theoretical justification for the approach. M -estimators include maximum-likelihood, least squares estimates and limited information estimators, but also estimators used for misspecified models, hence, the new simulation-based power modeling method is widely applicable. The MSPE employs a parametric model to describe the relationship between power and sample size, which can then be used to determine the required sample size for a specified power rate. We highlight its performance in linear and nonlinear structural equation models (SEM) for correctly specified models and models under distributional misspecification. Simulation results suggest that the new power modeling method is unbiased and shows good performance with regard to root mean squared error and type I error rates for the predicted required sample sizes and predicted power rates, outperforming alternative approaches, such as the naïve approach of selecting a discrete selection of sample sizes with linear interpolation of power or simple logistic regression approaches. The MSPE appears to be a valuable tool to estimate power for models without an (asymptotic) analytical power estimation.",

          "abstract": "Does residential mobility change cultures, or is it merely a downstream indicator for other forces? Using large-scale surveys of citizens of 18 industrialized nations, we find that increased rates of residential mobility predict living in a more dynamic society at least 10 years in the future: one in which residents are more satisfied with their lives, have greater optimism, endorse more individualistic concepts, are more open to new ideas, have a greater sense of freedom of action, feel able to make friends more easily, express a more cosmopolitan identity, believe that their society rewards merit, and hold their community to a higher standard for treatment of minorities. These findings are echoed in the experience of Americans who have themselves recently moved, where we find that having successfully moved predicts a future sense of personal thriving, optimism, and a belief that merit is rewarded.",

          "abstract": "Despite much research on improving intergroup relations, the evidence for long-term effects in real-world settings is mixed. We used the social marketing approach to create an “Inclusivity Page” that could be added to course syllabi. The page contained three targeted pro-diversity messages based on social norms, personal benefits, and concrete behavioral recommendations. We tested our intervention in a large randomized controlled trial in university classrooms ( N students = 1,799). We obtained students’ course grades and overall college GPAs several years later. A subset of students also completed an outcome survey three months after the intervention. Students from underrepresented racial groups exposed to the intervention early in college had better course grades and GPAs. We also observed an enhanced sense of belonging and better emotional and physical health among students from all marginalized groups. Our research demonstrates the utility of employing a targeted approach to improve experiences of members of marginalized groups.",

          "abstract": "Obesity has adverse consequences for those affected. We tested whether the association between obesity and its adverse consequences is reduced in regions in which obesity is prevalent and whether lower weight bias in high-obese regions can account for this reduction. Studies 1 and 2 used data from the United States ( N = 2,846,132 adults across 2,546 counties) and United Kingdom ( N = 180,615 adults across 380 districts) that assessed obesity’s adverse consequences in diverse domains: close relationships, economic outcomes, and health. Both studies revealed that the association between obesity and its adverse consequences is reduced (or absent) in high-obese regions. Study 3 used another large-scale data set ( N = 409,837 across 2,928 U.S. counties) and revealed that lower weight bias in high-obese regions seems to account for (i.e., mediate) the reduction in obesity’s adverse consequences. Overall, our findings suggest that obesity’s adverse consequences are partly social and, thus, not inevitable.",

          "authors": "Krishnan Nair, Mohsen Mosleh, Maryam Kouchaki",
          "abstract": "We conducted a preregistered field experiment examining racial discrimination in tie formation on social media. We randomly assigned research accounts varying on race (Black, White) and politics (liberal/Democrat, conservative/Republican, neutral) to follow a politically balanced sample of Twitter (i.e., X) users ( N = 5,951) who were unaware they were in a research study. We examined three predictions from the social and political psychology literatures: i) individuals favor White over Black targets, ii) this tendency is stronger for conservatives/Republicans than for liberals/Democrats, and iii) greater discrimination by conservatives/Republicans is explained by the assumption that racial minorities are liberal/Democrat. We found evidence that individuals were less likely to reciprocate social ties with Black accounts than White accounts. However, this tendency was not moderated by individuals’ political orientation, shared partisanship, or partisan mismatch. In sum, this work provides field experimental evidence for racial discrimination in tie formation on social media by individuals across political backgrounds.",
