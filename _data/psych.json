          "abstract": "Questionable research practices (QRPs) pose a significant threat to the quality of scientific research. However, historically, they remain ill-defined, and a comprehensive list of QRPs is lacking. In this article, we address this concern by defining, collecting, and categorizing QRPs using a community-consensus method. Collaborators of the study agreed on the following definition: QRPs are ways of producing, maintaining, sharing, analyzing, or interpreting data that are likely to produce misleading conclusions, typically in the interest of the researcher. QRPs are not normally considered to include research practices that are prohibited or proscribed in the researcher’s field (e.g., fraud, research misconduct). Neither do they include random researcher error (e.g., accidental data loss). Drawing from both iterative discussions and existing literature, we collected, defined, and categorized 40 QRPs for quantitative research. We also considered attributes such as potential harms, detectability, clues, and preventive measures for each QRP. The results suggest that QRPs are pervasive and versatile and have the potential to undermine all stages of the scientific enterprise. This work contributes to the maintenance of research integrity, transparency, and reliability by raising awareness for and improving the understanding of QRPs in quantitative psychological research.",

          "abstract": "Tools that can be used to collect behavioural data during pandemics are needed to inform policy and practice. The objective of this project was to develop the Your COVID-19 Risk tool in response to the global spread of COVID-19, aiming to promote health behaviour change. We developed an online resource based on key behavioural evidence-based risk factors related to contracting and spreading COVID-19. This tool allows for assessing risk and provides instant support to protect individuals from infection. The Risk Estimation Questions assessed users’ location, age, gender, work environment, day-to-day behaviours currently performed, and conditions under which these behaviours would change. Users were also asked to estimate how often they keep their distance from others in public and regularly wash their hands, and the procedures they follow to do so. A multidisciplinary research team of more than 150 international experts developed the tool. Over 60,000 users in more than 150 countries have assessed their risk and provided data. The majority of respondents reported that they almost always keep their distance from others in public places, and most participants reported washing their hands after touching public or shared surfaces or when entering buildings. The tool, data, and results were openly shared to support government and health agencies developing behaviour change interventions. This tool creates a blueprint for similar digital infrastructure that can be replicated and used in future pandemics.",

          "abstract": "Establishing a reliable and valid measure is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and replicability of research findings on risk and uncertainty preference. However, few studies have assessed the reliability and validity of behavioral measures of uncertainty preference. This study examined the convergent validity and test–retest reliability of three commonly used uncertainty preference measures: forced binary choice, certainty equivalent, and matching probability tasks. Experiments 1 ( N = 302) and 2 ( N = 366) tested the convergent validity and test–retest reliability of one-off assessment of these measures and found that the three measures did not demonstrate satisfactory convergent validity and test–retest reliability for the one-off assessment. Experiment 3 ( N = 311) increased the number of repeats to explore whether repeated measurements could enhance convergent validity and test–retest reliability by addressing the attenuation effect of lack of reliability. The convergent validity between certainty equivalent and matching probability improved in the repeated measurement condition. However, the test–retest reliability of the three measures was still not satisfactory in repeated measurement conditions. These findings highlight the measurement issues in the behavioral measures of uncertainty preferences. The potential causes of this low validity and reliability of behavioral measures of uncertainty preference are discussed.",

          "authors": "George Kinnear, Ian Jones, Ben Davies",
          "abstract": "Comparative judgement (CJ) provides methods for constructing measurement scales, by asking assessors to make a series of pairwise comparisons of the artefacts or representations to be scored. Researchers using CJ need to decide how many assessors to recruit and how many comparisons to collect. They also need to gauge the reliability of the resulting measurement scale, with two different estimates in widespread use: scale separation reliability (SSR) and split-halves reliability (SHR). Previous research has offered guidance on these issues, but with either limited empirical support or focused only on education research. In this paper, we offer guidance based on our analysis of 101 CJ datasets that we collated from previous research across a range of disciplines. We present two novel findings, with substantive implications for future CJ research. First, we find that collecting ten comparisons for every representation is generally sufficient; a more lenient guideline than previously published. Second, we conclude that SSR can serve as a reliable proxy for inter-rater reliability, but recommend that researchers use a higher threshold of .8, rather than the current standard of .7.",

          "abstract": "Corresponding with President Trump’s campaign rhetoric and enactment of the “Muslim ban,” anti-Muslim bias and hate crimes rose in the US. Although it was repealed in 2021, many Americans disagreed with revoking the ban and continued to stereotype Muslims as terrorists. This study investigates whether the Muslim ban affected implicit anti-Muslim bias in the US using Project Implicit data, Muslim ban activity records, and state-level election data. Multilevel modeling revealed that, across state political contexts (i.e., presidential election outcomes), the ban was associated with less anti-Muslim implicit bias among liberals during – compared to before and after – the Muslim ban. Conservatives, instead, showed stable but higher levels of anti-Muslim bias across Muslim ban periods and state political contexts. Demonstrating a policy backlash effect among liberals, this study sheds light on how individuals unconsciously responded to the Muslim ban across state political contexts and holds implications for policy implementation across the political spectrum.",

          "abstract": "Names are important aspects of identity, but when they are perceived as difficult to pronounce or “foreign,” they may trigger discriminatory responses. Rather than engaging in name “whitening” as a solution, we advocate placing the onus on others to learn to pronounce names of ethnic minority group members. In one study with White American college students, we examine the effects of a name learning intervention on communications to and perceptions of a Chinese student partner. In a second study with Chinese international students, we examine how name use is perceived. Those who learned to pronounce names (Study 1) and those whose names were used (Study 2) showed increased interest in and behavior geared toward maintaining partner contact, though other outcomes related to ethnic attitudes were unaffected. The data provide initial evidence that name learning and use contribute to more positive interactions and shed light on strategies for promoting inclusion.",

          "abstract": "Research is a paradoxical process. Scholars confront conflicting yet interwoven pressures, considering methodologies that engage complexity and simplicity, induction and deduction, novelty and continuity, and more. Paradox theory offers insights that embrace such tensions, providing empirical examples that harness creative friction to foster more novel and useful, rigorous, and relevant research. Leveraging this lens, we open a conversation on research tensions, developing the foundations of a Paradox Approach to Methods applicable to organization studies more broadly. To do so, we first identify tensions raised at six methodological decision points: research scope, construct definition, underlying assumptions, data collection, data analysis, and interpretation. Second, we build on paradox theory to identify navigating practices: accepting, differentiating, integrating, and knotting. By doing so, we contribute to organizational research broadly by embracing methods of tensions to advance scholarly insight.",

          "abstract": "Reducing CO 2 emissions in the transport sector is a societal challenge that requires collaboration, such as sharing cargo space to reduce truck usage. Yet, such collaboration remains rare due to self-interest. A recent study using a game simulating transport collaboration showed that measured perspective-taking (focusing on others) predicted greater inclusion in collaborations and higher earnings. In two experiments ( N = 1,446), we experimentally induced perspective-taking for one party before the negotiation to test for comparable effects. While both experiments replicated the effects of measured perspective-taking in behaviors conducive to CO 2 reduction (proposing larger coalitions and making more other-serving offers), neither replicated the economic benefits. This suggests that while both measured and induced perspective-taking influence coalition behavior similarly, only measured perspective-taking predicts favorable economic outcomes. Further analyses showed that experimentally inducing perspective-taking only leads to beneficial outcomes if participants actively engage in it. Potential explanations for this discrepancy are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Moral licensing occurs when someone who initially behaves morally subsequently acts less morally. We apply reputation-based theories to predict when and why it occurs. As pre-registered, we predicted: (1) being observed would be associated with larger licensing effects and (2) unambiguous outcomes would have smaller licensing effects. In a multi-level meta-analysis of 115 experiments ( N = 21,770), moral licensing was stronger when participants were observed ( g = 0.65) than unobserved ( g = 0.13). After accounting for publication bias with robust Bayesian meta-analysis, there was moderate evidence for licensing when participants were observed ( g = 0.51; BF 10 = 9.14), but moderate evidence against licensing when unobserved (Hedge’s g = −0.01; BF 10 = 0.11). Ambiguity did not moderate moral licensing. These findings suggest that moral licensing is elicited through interpersonal motives, clarify when licensing (vs. consistency) occurs, and explain why many online studies failed to replicate. Evidence for intrapsychic motives is inconclusive.",

          "abstract": "With more opportunities for diverse interactions, little is known about how social interactions involving people of different socioeconomic status (SES) may unfold. We investigated social-attunement patterns in dyadic interactions involving SES. Unacquainted adults recruited from a community in the United States interacted with similar-or-different-SES partners in the lab ( N = 130 dyads). Attunement was assessed throughout the interaction by examining physiological linkage —how much a person’s physiological change is predicted by another’s physiological change over time. Overall, low-SES participants showed stronger physiological linkage—indicating greater attunement—to partners across SES. Participants also appeared more comfortable when interacting with low-SES partners. There were no SES differences in dominance during the conversation. After the interaction, participants reported liking similar-SES partners more than different-SES partners. These patterns suggest that during interactions, lower-SES individuals are more other-focused than high-SES individuals, and in-group preference prevails. We note limitations in the racial representation of our sample.",

This index was derived from a prior genome-wide association study on educational attainment in democratic countries. In 1,930 individuals aged 25 to 85 years from the SOEP-G[ene] cohort, the magnitude of polygenic associations with educational attainment did not differ between East and West Germany before reunification but increased in East Germany thereafter. This gene–environment interaction remained robust when we probed for variance dispersion. A control analysis using a polygenic index of height suggests that this interaction is unlikely to reflect a general trend toward greater genetic associations in East Germany after reunification. The observed amplification of education-genetic associations aligns with theories suggesting heightened genetic influences on educational attainment during periods of greater social and educational opportunity. We emphasize the need for replication in larger German genetic data sets.",

          "abstract": "Biased media content shapes children’s social concepts and identities. We examined gender bias in a large corpus of scripts from 98 children’s television programs from the United States spanning the years 1960 to 2018 (6,600 episodes, ~2.7 million sentences, ~16 million words). We focused on agency and communion, the fundamental psychological dimensions underlying gender stereotypes. At the syntactic level, words referring to men or boys (vs. women or girls) appear more often in the agent (vs. patient) role. This syntactic bias remained stable between 1960 and 2018. At the semantic level, words referring to men or boys (vs. women or girls) co-occurred more often with words denoting agency. Words denoting communion showed both stereotypical and counterstereotypical associations. Some semantic gender biases have remained unchanged or have weakened over time; others have grown. These findings suggest that gender stereotypes are built into the core of children’s stories. Whether we are closer today to gender equality in children’s media depends on where one looks.",
