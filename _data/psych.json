          "authors": "Tim Kaiser, Philipp Herzog",
          "abstract": "Statistical prediction models are ubiquitous in psychological research and practice. Increasingly, machine-learning models are used. Quantifying the uncertainty of such predictions is rarely considered, partly because prediction intervals are not defined for many of the algorithms used. However, generating and reporting prediction models without information on the uncertainty of the predictions carries the risk of overinterpreting their accuracy. Conventional methods for prediction intervals (e.g., those defined for ordinary least squares regression) are sensitive to violations of several distributional assumptions. In this tutorial, we introduce conformal prediction, a model-agnostic, distribution-free method for generating prediction intervals with guaranteed marginal coverage, to psychological research. We start by introducing the basic rationale of prediction intervals using a motivating example. Then, we proceed to conformal prediction, which is illustrated in three increasingly complex examples using publicly available data and R code.",

          "abstract": "Musicians are often regarded as a positive example of brain plasticity and associated cognitive benefits. This emerges when experienced musicians (e.g., musicians with more than 10 years of music training and practice) are compared with nonmusicians. A frequently observed behavioral finding is a short-term memory advantage of the former over the latter. Although available meta-analysis reported that the effect size of this advantage is medium (Hedges’s g = 0.5), no literature study was adequately powered to estimate reliably an effect of such size. This multilab study has been ideated, realized, and conducted in lab by several groups that have been working on this topic. Our ultimate goal was to provide a community-driven shared and reliable estimate of the musicians’ short-term memory advantage (if any) and set a method and a standard for future studies in neuroscience and psychology comparing musicians and nonmusicians. Thirty-three research units recruited a total of 600 experienced musicians and 600 nonmusicians, a number that is sufficiently large to estimate a small effect size (Hedges’s g = 0.3) with a high statistical power (i.e., 95%). Subsequently, we measured the difference in short-term memory for musical, verbal, and visuospatial stimuli. We also looked at cognitive, personality, and socioeconomic factors that might mediate the difference. Musicians had better short-term memory than nonmusicians for musical, verbal, and visuospatial stimuli with an effect size of, respectively, Hedges’s g s = 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.94, 1.22]; large), 0.16 (95% CI = [0.02 0.30]; very small), and 0.28 (95% CI = [0.15, 0.41]; small). This work sets the basis for sound research practices in studies comparing musicians and nonmusicians and contributes to the ongoing debate on the possible cognitive benefits of musical training.",

          "authors": "Yeh-Tai Chou, Yao-Ting Sung, Wei-Hung Yang",
          "abstract": "The use of continuous rating scales such as the visual analogue scale (VAS) in research has increased, yet they are less popular than discrete scales like the Likert scale. The non-popularity of continuous scales is primarily due to the lack of validated analytical tools and user-friendly interfaces, which have also jointly resulted in a lack of sufficient theoretical and empirical research supporting confidence in using continuous rating formats. This research aims to address these gaps through four studies. The first study proposed an algorithm and developed the Continuous Rating Scale Analytics (CoRSA) to estimate parameters for the continuous rating scale model (Müller, Psychometrika , 52 , 165–181, 1987). The second study evaluated CoRSA’s efficacy in analyzing continuous scores compared to pcIRT (Hohensinn, Journal of Statistical Software , 84 , 1–14, 2018) and discrete scores against ConQuest (Adams et al., 2020). Results showed superior parameter recovery with CoRSA for continuous data and comparable outcomes for discrete data. The third study analyzed empirical data from career interest and work value assessments using both VAS and Likert scales with CoRSA, demonstrating good model-data fit and validating CoRSA’s effectiveness in rescaling data to interval measurements. Finally, the fourth study integrated CoRSA into the VAS-RRP 2.0 platform (Sung &amp; Wu, Behavior Research Methods , 50 , 1694–1715, 2018) to enhance accessibility and usability, allowing researchers and practitioners unfamiliar with statistical procedures to easily analyze continuous data. These findings confirm CoRSA as a valid tool for analyzing both continuous and discrete data, enhancing the utility of continuous rating formats in diverse research contexts.",

          "authors": "Nir Ofir, Ayelet N. Landau",
          "abstract": "Multiple systems in the brain track the passage of time and can adapt their activity to temporal requirements. While the neural implementation of timing varies widely between neural substrates and behavioral tasks, at the algorithmic level, many of these behaviors can be described using drift-diffusion models of decision-making. In this work, wedevelop a drift-diffusion model to fit performance in the temporal generalization task, in which participants are required to categorize an interval as being the same or different compared to a standard, or reference, duration. The model includes a drift-diffusion process which starts with interval onset, representing the internal estimate of elapsed duration, and two boundaries. If the drift-diffusion process at interval offset is between the boundaries, the interval is categorized as equal to the standard. If it is below the lower boundary or above the upper boundary, the interval is categorized as different. This model outperformed previous models in fitting the data of single participants and in parameter recovery analyses. We also used the drift-diffusion model to analyze data from two experiments, one comparing performance between vision and audition and another examining the effect of learning. We found that decision boundaries can be modified independently: While the upper boundary was higher in vision than in audition, the lower boundary decreased with learning in the task. In both experiments, timing noise was positively correlated with upper boundaries across participants, which reflects an accuracy-maximizing strategy in the task.",

          "authors": "Serena Castellotti, Irene Petrizzo, Roberto Arrighi, Elvio Blini",
          "abstract": "The measurement of pupil size is a classic tool in psychophysiology, but its popularity has recently surged due to the rapid developments of the eye-tracking industry. Concurrently, several authors have outlined a wealth of strategies for tackling pupillary recordings analytically. The consensus is that the “temporal” aspect of changes in pupil size is key, and that the analytical approach should be mindful of the temporal factor. Here we take a more radical stance on the matter by suggesting that, by the time significant changes in pupil size are detected, it is already too late . We suggest that these changes are indeed the result of distinct, core physiological processes that originate several hundreds of milliseconds before that moment and altogether shape the observed signal. These processes can be recovered indirectly by leveraging dimensionality reduction techniques. Here we therefore outline key concepts of temporal principal components analysis and related rotations to show that they reveal a latent, low-dimensional space that represents these processes very efficiently: a pupillary manifold. We elaborate on why assessing the pupillary manifold provides an alternative, appealing analytical solution for data analysis. In particular, dimensionality reduction returns scores that are (1) mindful of the relevant physiology underlying the observed changes in pupil size, (2) extremely handy and manageable for statistical modelling, and (3) devoid of several arbitrary choices. We elaborate on these points in the form of a tutorial paper for the functions provided in the accompanying R library “Pupilla.”",

          "authors": "Hanna Rajh-Weber, Stefan Ernest Huber, Martin Arendasy",
          "abstract": "Selecting an appropriate statistical method is a challenge frequently encountered by applied researchers, especially if assumptions for classical, parametric approaches are violated. To provide some guidelines and support, we compared classical hypothesis tests with their typical distributional assumptions of normality and homoskedasticity with common and easily accessible alternative inference methods (HC3, HC4, and six bootstrap methods) in the framework of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. The method’s performance was assessed for four different regression models with varying levels of non-normality and heteroskedasticity of errors, and for five different sample sizes ranging from 25 to 500 cases. For each scenario, 10,000 samples of observations were generated. Type I error and coverage rates, power, and standard error bias were examined to assess the methods’ performance. No method considered here performed satisfactorily on all accounts. Using HC3 or HC4 standard errors, or a wild bootstrap procedure with percentile confidence intervals, could yield reliable results in many, but not all, scenarios. We suppose that, in the case of assumption violations, researchers might refer to a method that performed best in a scenario most similar to their data situation. To aid the selection of an appropriate method, we provide tables comparing relative performances in all considered scenarios.",

          "authors": "Jesse Boot, Jill de Ron, Jonas Haslbeck, Sacha Epskamp",
          "abstract": "In psychological studies, it is common practice to select a sample based on the sum score of the modeled variables (e.g., based on symptom severity when investigating the associations between those same symptoms). However, this practice introduces bias if the sum score selection imperfectly defines the population of interest. Here, we propose a correction for this type of selection bias in the Ising model, a popular network model for binary data. Possible applications of our correction are when one wants to obtain (1) full population estimates when only the sum score subset of the data is available, and (2) improved estimates of a subpopulation, if we observe a mixture of populations that differ from each other in the sum score. In a simulation study, we verify that our correction recovers the network structure of the desired population after a sum score selection using both a node-wise regression and a multivariate estimation of the Ising model. In an example, we show how our correction can be used in practice using empirical data on symptoms of major depression from the National Comorbidity Study Replication ( N = 9,282). We implemented our correction in four commonly used R packages for estimating the Ising model, namely IsingFit , IsingSampler , psychonetrics, and bootnet.",

We examined whether this trend manifested in professional athletes’ decisions regarding social justice messages they display on their uniforms. We tested whether the helmet decal (NFL) and jersey slogan (NBA) choices made by athletes as they participated in league-wide uniform modifications to promote social justice differed as a function of player race. We found that White NFL players were less likely than Black NFL players to choose specific victim names (e.g., “Breonna Taylor”), were more likely to choose generic phrases de-emphasizing racism (e.g., “It Takes All of Us”), and were less likely to choose generic phrases highlighting racism (e.g., “End Racism”). Similarly, White NBA players were more likely than Black NBA players to choose phrases that de-emphasized racism (e.g., “Peace”), and less likely to choose those that emphasized racism (e.g., “Antiracist”).",

          "abstract": "Children morally prioritize humans over animals less than adults do. Is this because children are less speciesist—meaning they place less moral weight on mere species membership? Or is it because they give less weight to differences in cognitive capacity between humans and other animals? We investigated this in two experiments, presenting children and adult participants in the United States and Spain with moral trade-off dilemmas. These dilemmas involved individuals who varied in species membership (human vs. monkey) and cognitive capacity. Across both cultures, children were less likely than adults to prioritize humans over animals, regardless of cognitive capacity. In addition, participants tended to prioritize individuals with higher cognitive capacities, regardless of species membership—though this effect was less robust in children. Our findings suggest that children in these Western contexts are indeed less speciesist than adults, though they do not rule out developmental changes in the moral weight assigned to cognitive capacity.",

          "abstract": "Despite the potential to significantly increase the impact of donations, people often fail to prioritize the cost-effectiveness of charities. This paper examines an explanation for why people may donate less effectively due to reputational concerns that favor empathizing with donation recipients rather than deliberating about the cost-effectiveness of charities. Across seven studies, we find that “deliberators” are perceived as less moral and less desirable as social partners than “empathizers.” Moreover, people accurately anticipate the reputational costs of deliberation and are more likely to donate to causes that evoke more empathy but are less cost-effective when reputational concerns are highlighted. Our findings suggest that there are disincentives for selecting charities by deliberating about their cost-effectiveness, as people are more rewarded for signaling socially valued moral traits than for prioritizing charitable impact.",

          "abstract": "Recent perspectives have challenged the view that left-wingers are less likely to derogate out-group members. Building on research demonstrating heightened out-group derogation by Progressive (vs. Traditional Liberal) left-wingers, we examined whether Progressives and Traditional Liberals differentially tolerate in-group dissenters on the issue of gender identity. Using reverse correlation, Study 1 found that the Progressive-generated face of J.K. Rowling (a prominent gender critical left-winger) was evaluated negatively, while the Traditional Liberal–generated face was evaluated positively. Study 2 found that in both abstract (general description) and concrete (public figure) presentations, faces of left-wing in-group members expressing gender critical views were judged more negatively than self-identification faces, with Progressive-generated gender critical faces evaluated more negatively than Traditional Liberals–generated faces.

          "abstract": "People readily moralize health, whether by criticizing smokers or treating exercise as noble. Drawing from the theory of dyadic morality, we theorized that people moralize health most strongly when they perceive poor health as a source of suffering. Through five studies (total N = 2,055), we show that perceived harm can drive the moralization of health. We identified three types of harm—personal, interpersonal, and collective—that people perceive as relevant to health and created a 15-item measure to capture each (Study 1). Perceived interpersonal harm reliably predicted moralizations of health, whether health was conceived broadly (Study 2) or as a concrete health issue (e.g., smoking, eating healthfully, disease prevention; Study 3). Experimentally manipulating the interpersonal harmfulness of a health behavior caused participants to moralize it (Studies 4 and 5), whereas disgust had no unique effect (Study 4). We suggest that perceived harm plays a key role in moralizing health.",

          "abstract": "People’s beliefs about sexual minorities are intertwined with their beliefs about gender (i.e., the sexuality-as-gendered framework), leading to the prediction that the amount of friendly contact with sexual minorities will be related to one’s beliefs about gender. We test this prediction across two studies (total N = 860), to show that reported friendships with sexual minorities relate not only to beliefs about sexual minorities, but also to attitudes toward people who are gender atypical, beliefs about traditional gender roles and norms, and endorsement of different versions of sexism. Our findings indicate that the sexuality-as-gendered framework involves not only people’s cognitions in terms of beliefs and attitudes, but also the types of interpersonal relationships they maintain.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Pitt",
          "abstract": "To navigate complex physical environments, animals keep track of the spatial relations among objects using various reference frames, both body-based (e.g., left/right) and environment-based (e.g., east/west), but how these spatial representations interact remains unresolved. Whereas neuroscientific findings show habitual integration across reference frames, psycholinguistic accounts suggest humans use one reference frame at a time, as in speech. This article examines whether people spontaneously use two reference frames in the same action. When placing a single object in a two-dimensional array, adult participants ( N = 110) routinely used an environment-based frame to determine the object’s left–right position while using a body-based frame to determine its front–back position at the same time. Such hybrid responses were prevalent among both Indigenous Tsimane’ and educated U.S. participants, suggesting that people across cultures habitually construct compound cognitive maps to represent the multidimensional spatial relations that compose natural settings.",

          "abstract": "What are the risky choices people face in our complex and fast-changing world? This article reports on a series of population surveys in Switzerland ( N = 4,380) that collected those risky choices that are relevant in people’s everyday lives. Using this empirical basis, we developed an inventory consisting of 100 unique real-life choices to address open questions regarding the structure, life domains, and stability of the current ecology of risk. Moreover, a follow-up study ( N = 933) indicated some degree of generalizability of the construct of risk preference to the newly identified real-life choices. The five key insights that emerged from our analyses may be useful for researchers studying decision-making under risk and uncertainty (e.g., what criteria to use when developing novel measurement instruments) and policymaking in applied settings (e.g., addressing how swiftly the risks of modern life change).",

          "abstract": "In Eskreis-Winkler and Fishbach (2019), failure stymies learning: People learn less from failure than success. The commentary proposes that the failure to learn from failure could be due to a tendency to respond consistently. Although a consistent response pattern explains why people struggle to learn from failure in some paradigms, we argue that it does not explain the results of the original paradigm. Certain consistency mechanisms require that people assume they should be consistent with their initial intuition instead of updating as they learn new information. This assumption does not apply to the original paradigm. We discuss how the commentary helps sharpen the criteria for assessing learning from failure and the role of consistency as one potential barrier to learning.",

          "authors": "Sabrina M McKenzie, Amanda E Krause, Solange Glasser, Margaret S Osborne",
          "abstract": "Music listening can impact emotional well-being. However, self-compassion, an aspect strongly related to emotional well-being, is rarely discussed in music listening literature. Therefore, this study explored self-compassionate and uncompassionate music listening experiences within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Two hundred and ninety-six Australian university students ( M age = 19.32) completed a mixed-methods music listening and self-compassion questionnaire. The questionnaire included the Self-Compassion Short Form Scale along with an author-adapted version exploring the influence of music listening. Additional, open-ended questions probed self-compassionate and uncompassionate music listening experiences. Most participants (81.76%) reported self-compassionate experiences through listening to music during the pandemic. Template analysis examining people’s self-compassionate and uncompassionate music listening experiences resulted in an overlap of themes including emotional experience, connection , and music styles . Distinct patterns were found, such as positive outcomes in self-compassionate responses and negative outcomes in uncompassionate experiences. The inclusion of emotional release within uncompassionate responses demonstrates the complexity of the relationship between music listening and self-compassion. These findings highlight the need for further exploration into music listening and self-compassion, particularly in an everyday context beyond the pandemic.",
