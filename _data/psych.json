          "authors": "Anja F. Ernst, Jonas M. B. Haslbeck",
          "abstract": "Time-series data have become ubiquitous in psychological research, allowing us to study detailed within-person dynamics and their heterogeneity across persons. Vector autoregressive (VAR) models have become a popular choice as a first approximation of these dynamics. The VAR model for each person and heterogeneity across persons can be jointly modeled using a hierarchical model that treats heterogeneity as a latent distribution. Currently, the most popular choice for this is the multilevel VAR model, which models heterogeneity across persons as quantitative variation through a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Here, we discuss an alternative, the latent class VAR model, which models heterogeneity as qualitative variation using a number of discrete clusters. While this model has been introduced before, it has not been readily accessible to researchers. Here we address this issue by providing an accessible introduction to latent class VAR models; a simulation evaluating how well this model can be estimated in situations resembling applied research; introducing a new R package ClusterVAR , which provides easy-to-use functions to estimate the model; and providing a fully reproducible tutorial on modeling emotion dynamics, which walks the reader through all steps of estimating, analyzing, and interpreting latent class VAR models.",

          "abstract": "Prototypes—internalized knowledge structures of the most typical or characteristic features of a concept—are important because they influence cognitive processing. Yet prototype analysis, the method used to examine prototypes, appears relatively underutilized in organizational research. To introduce prototype analysis to a wider audience of organizational scholars, we conducted a critical methodological literature review following a six-step procedure. Seventy-three prototype analyses published in 35 journals were categorized and their content analyzed. A prototype analysis typically includes a sequence of independent studies conducted over two stages, recently referred to as the standard procedure. Our review makes several contributions, including development of a taxonomy of prototype analysis applications, clarification of the standard procedure of a prototype analysis and possible variations, and suggestions for organizational research. Benefits of undertaking a prototype analysis include improved understanding of abstract workplace concepts that are difficult to measure directly, the ability to compare cross-cultural prototypes, and an approach for investigating the issue of construct redundancy. We conclude with best-practice recommendations, implications for organizational scholarship, methodological limitations, and future research suggestions.",

          "abstract": "Individuals can construe the world around them more concretely or more abstractly, with consequences for their judgments and behaviors. With five studies involving 3,963 U.S. adult participants, we test whether people hold stereotypes about the tendency for different groups to think more concretely or more abstractly. Across Studies 1 to 3, individuals report explicit and consistent construal level stereotypes about social groups in various demographic, occupational, and non-human categories. In Studies 2 and 3, we provide evidence that construal level stereotypes are correlated with, yet distinct from, stereotypes about their competence, agency, and power. In Studies 4 and 5, we offer evidence of predictive validity with two experiments showing that individuals use construal level stereotypes to inform employee selection decisions. These findings integrate and advance two major topics in social cognition: construal level theory and stereotyping. We discuss societal implications of construal level stereotypes predicting behaviors associated with discrimination in resource allocation.",

          "authors": "Silje Steinsbekk, Lars Wichstrøm, Tilmann von Soest",
          "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in personality development in childhood and adolescence. However, population-based longitudinal studies that examine self-reported personality traits and their facets during these critical developmental periods are scarce. Here, we test the disruption hypothesis, which suggests deviations from standard patterns of personality maturation during adolescence in certain personality domains. Our study extends existing knowledge by examining development and sex differences in self-reported conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, and their facets from childhood to adolescence. Utilizing the Big Five Inventory, we collected four waves of personality data (ages 10, 12, 14, and 16 years) from a representative birth cohort of Norwegian children ( N = 805). Our results predominantly support the disruption hypothesis, showing declines in conscientiousness and agreeableness across sexes from age 12, with an increase in neuroticism observed solely for girls. The findings further demonstrate that maturation disruptions vary at the facet level, suggesting a complex developmental process.",

          "abstract": "Repeated exposure to information increases receptivity to it, even when prior knowledge is present, according to the illusory truth effect. Fazio et al. provided empirical support for this phenomenon and proposed a model that posited dominance of fluency cues, relative to knowledge utilization. This model better elucidated participants’ behaviors than an alternative model assuming precedence of knowledge processes over fluency-related mechanisms. The present research builds on this by refining models and testing them with new and existing data. While reanalysis of existing data revealed comparable performance of both models, new data from two experiments ( N = 324), introducing conditions conducive to discerning between the two models, uncovered compelling evidence in support of the model that assumes knowledge processes’ precedence. The discrepancy between Fazio et al. and our findings is discussed, and we encourage future research to explore avenues for resolving the relative roles of knowledge and fluency.",

          "abstract": "The adaptation account suggests that the persistence of some traditional values in modern society is due to their enduring adaptive utility. We tested this hypothesis by examining the change of filial piety in two Confucian societies, China and Japan. By analyzing natural language data, Study 1 found that Chinese people’s concern about and liking for filial piety have increased since 1979, with falling birth rate and rising elderly population as the Granger causes. By analyzing survey data from 2006 to 2017 ( N = 7,283) in China, Study 2 found that reciprocal filial piety was adaptive (i.e., conducive to well-being) and increasing, whereas authoritarian filial piety was maladaptive (i.e., detrimental to well-being) and decreasing. By analyzing both Japanese language data from 1989 to 2023 (Study 3a) and survey data from 2006 to 2018 (Study 3b: N = 4,763), Study 3 replicated the main findings from China. These findings support the adaptation account of cultural persistence.",

          "abstract": "Geographic disparities in household indebtedness present an economic puzzle that traditional models inadequately explain. We examine whether regional psychological traits—specifically courage—help explain these differences. Analyzing data from 836,184 individuals across 1,220 U.S. counties, we tested whether areas with higher collective courage (willingness to act despite fear) exhibit higher debt-to-income ratios. Using spatial regression techniques to account for geographic clustering and controlling for sociodemographic factors and Big Five personality traits, we found that courage significantly predicted county-level debt-to-income ratios. A one standard deviation increase in regional courage was associated with a 0.22 standard deviation increase in debt-to-income—an effect that persisted across different geographic scales and modeling approaches. Courage hotspots in western and southern regions showed corresponding patterns of higher indebtedness. These findings reveal that psychological traits traditionally viewed as virtuous may have unintended economic consequences, highlighting the importance of considering regional psychology when designing financial policies and interventions.",

          "authors": "Shi Yin Chee, Ester Ellen Trees Bolt",
          "abstract": "Aging is a multifaceted, personal experience rather than a one-size-fits-all journey of universal longevity desires. This study explores the lived experiences of older adults in senior living facilities, focusing on their longevity aspirations and the factors shaping them. In-depth, semi-structured interviews with 20 older adults in four Malaysian senior living facilities were analyzed using Husserl’s phenomenology and Giorgi’s descriptive method. Four themes emerged: balancing the desire to live long versus living well, emotional and existential reflections, hidden emotional and physical adaptations, and shifting dynamics of control over priorities and values. Findings reveal that aging is an unpredictable journey, shaped by ambiguities and uncertainties, where fulfillment does not always stem from longevity. Tailored support that honors older adults’ histories, emotions, and aspirations enables aging with dignity and autonomy, guiding providers, policymakers, and caregivers to enhance quality of life to meaningfully enhance quality of life by aligning care with longevity aspirations.",
