          "abstract": "A clustering algorithm, named k -orders, is proposed to extract transitive relations from a data set. The k -orders algorithm differs from the original k -modes only in the adjustment step. Two adjustment procedures, named transitive centroid adjustment (TCA) and greedy TCA, are proposed that can be used to find clusters with transitive centroids. The proposed clustering approach finds application, especially in studies on preference, where this last may be heterogeneous across individuals, although transitive. The set of cluster centroids extracted by the algorithm from a data set can then be empirically tested via the estimation of a latent class model. The performance of the two versions of k -orders were compared to one another and with the canonical k -modes, in simulation studies. Results show that when centroids are transitive relations, both versions of k -orders outperform k -modes. Moreover, in experimental designs in which two-component options are considered, the TCA algorithm performs better than the greedy TCA. An empirical application was also carried out for exemplifying how k -orders can be useful for studying individual preferences.",

          "abstract": "In five studies conducted in Spain and the US, we tested whether rightists (vs. leftists) were more vulnerable to experiencing a threat to the moral self and were more likely to polarize when faced with negative moral stereotypes about environmentalism. Studies 1a–b established that the moral stereotype held by rightists about leftists regarding environmental issues was more positive than vice versa. Additionally, rightists had a more negative meta-stereotype than vice versa. Studies 2a–2b revealed that exposing participants to negative (vs. neutral) stereotypes about their groups’ morality in environmentalism led rightists (but not leftists) to experience a threat to their moral self-concept and polarized their environmental positions and voting intentions. Study 3 experimentally attenuated moral threats, buffering the effects observed in Study 2b. We conclude that the moral threat posed by negative moral stereotypes is key to understanding the polarization of environmental issues.",

          "abstract": "People assume that those who hold sexist beliefs hold racist beliefs, and vice versa. However, past work only investigated hostile sexism, or blatantly negative evaluations of women. Hostile sexism is positively associated with benevolent sexism, or, more subjectively, positive attitudes that serve to keep women in restricted domestic roles. Across two studies, participants were randomly assigned to see an ostensible partner’s responses espousing hostile sexism, benevolent sexism, or nonsexist beliefs. Participants then responded to dependent measures, primarily perceived racism. As predicted, a hostile sexist was perceived as more racist than both a benevolent sexist and a nonsexist. Unexpectedly, no significant differences emerged between a benevolent sexist and a nonsexist in Study 1, while a benevolent sexist was perceived as more racist than a nonsexist in Study 2. Overall, the findings suggest that society may be unaware that benevolent sexism may indicate racism, furthering individuals’ risk of experiencing prejudice.",

          "abstract": "Recent abortion restrictions in the US and Poland sparked widespread protests. This research examined how personal threat influenced collective action intentions through alliances with men and the LGBTIQ+ community (from women’s perspective), and alliances with women (from men’s perspective). It focused on two representations of intergroup cooperation: recategorization as one group and coalitions between distinct groups. In both countries, higher threat levels were linked to greater collective action intentions. For women, this was mediated by coalitions with men in Poland, but not in the US, while coalition with the LGBTIQ+ community mediated the relationship in both countries. Recategorization as one group mobilized women only in Poland when involving the LGBTIQ+ community. For men, coalitions with women mediated the link between threat and collective action in both countries. The findings suggest that coalitions preserving distinct group identities are more effective in advancing women’s rights than recategorization, especially when involving advantaged allies.",

          "abstract": "Five experiments ( N = 854) tested the hypothesis that U.S. adults generate explanations of Black–White differences that position Black Americans as “the effect to be explained” (EBE), and White Americans as the norm for comparison. Participants explained race differences in trust in the police (Experiment 1), success or failure in a drug rehabilitation program (Experiment 2), charitable donation rates (Experiment 3), or the benefits of a new medication (Experiments 4 and 5). Every experiment counterbalanced which group had the numerically higher or lower result and the more expected or unexpected data pattern. Participants’ explanations focused significantly more on Black Americans and on the group with the more unexpected results in four experiments. Explanatory focus was not related to perceptions of the mutability of groups’ behavior or which data pattern was numerically larger. Studies 1–4 used mostly White samples, but Experiment 5 found that Black and White participants both focused explanations on Blacks. The tendency to take Black Americans as the EBE is large when they show the less expected data pattern (Cohen’s d = 0.86), and medium ( d = 0.33) even when White Americans show the less expected data pattern. These data show why diversifying samples and research teams are necessary but not sufficient steps to undo the impact of structural inequalities on the representation of diverse people in psychology.",

          "abstract": "Few studies have systematically measured positions about the relationships between science and religion, and existing work has primarily focused on Christian samples from Western cultures. We collected data from individuals living in Australia, China, and the United States, encompassing both adults and undergraduates (total N = 985). We employed existing self-report instruments and novel items to measure positions about science and religion as well as individual attitudes toward science and religion (i.e., not in relation to one another). Exploratory factor and cluster analysis showed that, across samples, position dimensions included multiple facets of compatibility, both in general and specific terms, alongside a single conflict dimension. Correlations and moderated regressions showed that compatibility dimensions corresponded with depolarized attitudes toward science and religion, whereas the conflict dimension correlated with polarized attitudes. These results supported preregistered hypotheses. This study takes a step toward assessing positions more comprehensively, offering insights into their meanings.",

          "abstract": "Past research on intimate relationships suggests that exchange orientation—the tendency to expect direct reciprocation when providing a benefit—predicts lower relationship well-being. However, limited research has examined the long-term associations of this link or the effects of partner similarity in exchange orientation. The present research addressed this gap by employing a set of rigorous analyses on longitudinal data spanning 13 years from a national sample of romantic couples in Germany ( N = 7,293 couples). Latent curve models with structured residuals (LCM-SR) revealed that romantic partners, on average, experienced a general decline in exchange orientation over the course of their relationship. Partners who showed slower declines in exchange orientation experienced steeper declines in relationship satisfaction. Within-person increases in exchange orientation predicted future decreases in relationship satisfaction. Dyadic response surface analyses (DRSA) indicated no evidence of similarity effects. Overall, these findings corroborate the adverse effects of exchange orientation on intimate relationships.",

It has been proposed that the fallacy is more likely to occur when the coherence of a, b, c —the extent to which the three events fit together to form a united and complete story—is greater than that of a, b . In the current research, participants were presented with a three-event sequence made to appear coherent or non-coherent. The events were presented in one of three modalities (verbal, physical, and musical) with two studies in each modality. Compared to chance, participants were more likely to commit the fallacy in the coherent condition and less likely to commit the fallacy in the non-coherent condition. Coherence can thus serve as a conduit by which different circumstances can induce the conjunction fallacy.",

          "abstract": "Dating in later life is increasingly prevalent, yet research on older adults’ experiences within their newly formed relationships is scarce. Although older adults are often more adept in minimizing their reactivity when relational tensions arise, integrating insights from theories of aging and relationship development suggests that older adults’ advantage over younger adults may diminish, or even reverse, when examining reactivity in newly formed dating relationships. Married and dating couples ( N = 282; aged 30–88) completed a 21-day daily diary task. Multilevel modeling was used to estimate individuals’ negative affect, physical health symptoms, and relationship satisfaction on days of greater tension with a partner. Age was not associated with reactivity among married couples. Among dating couples, age was associated with emotional reactivity (women only) and physical reactivity, but not relational reactivity, such that older individuals experienced greater increases in emotional distress and physical health problems on higher tension days compared to younger individuals.",

          "abstract": "Diversity statements have become common practice for organizations; might this norm backfire for norm-adhering organizations? The present research examines if awareness of diversity statement norms across organizations leads to perceptions of an organization’s diversity statement as mere norm adherence. Across four experiments recruiting Black and LGBTQ+ U.S. participants ( N = 1,326), we find that when diversity statements are the norm across organizations, an organization’s diversity statement is viewed as more externally motivated and marginalized group members report lower anticipated belonging and perceive the organization as less committed to diversity than when organizational diversity statements are not the norm. We further examine perceptions of organizations that violate a diversity statement norm and how the strength of the norm impacts perceptions. By incorporating research on attributions and egalitarian norm perceptions, the present research affords novel insights into perceptions of organizational diversity commitments with implications for marginalized group members’ anticipated belonging.",

          "abstract": "Price negotiation is often a zero-sum interaction where one party’s gain is another’s loss. In such contexts, a buyer’s willingness to negotiate can depend on the perceived justifiability of negotiation. This research examines how political ideology shapes these perceptions. Two archival studies ( N = 56,615) and four preregistered studies ( N = 3,157) show that conservative buyers are more likely to negotiate prices for houses and used cars. Conservatives also hold stronger beliefs that buyers should negotiate prices regardless of the seller’s identity—be it a professional dealer, an ordinary seller, a stranger, or a friend. This heightened propensity to justify price negotiation is rooted in conservatives’ endorsement of free-market ideology, which motivates and even moralizes the pursuit of economic self-interest in marketplace interactions. These findings offer a nuanced account of interactions in the marketplace, demonstrating that marketplace behaviors are influenced not only by economic considerations but also by ideological beliefs.",

          "abstract": "Perceptual distraction distorts visual working memories. Recent research has shown divergent effects of distraction on memory performance, including attractive biases, impairment of memory precision, and an increase in the guess rate, indicating multiple mechanisms of distraction interference. Here we propose a novel signal-intrusion model based on the TCC (target-confusability-competition) framework to reconcile those discrepant results. We hypothesized that sensory interference is driven by the integration of a target signal and an intrusive distractor signal. Model comparisons showed that this TCC-intrusion model had a superior fit to memory error distributions across three delayed-estimation tasks with distraction ( N = 220 adults) compared with other candidate models. According to the model, distractor intrusions decreased along with target-distractor dissimilarity, in accordance with the sensory-recruitment hypothesis. Moreover, TCC-intrusion successfully replicated divergent effects of distraction on memory bias, precision, and guess rate using this one intrusion mechanism. Together, these results suggest that perceptual distractors affect working memories through a unified mechanism of signal intrusion.",

          "abstract": "Musical improvisation is a widely used practice within many musical genres and cultures. But although there have been several studies on the experience and psychological benefits of music listening and music making, few have focused specifically on musical improvisation outside the practices of music therapy and jazz improvisation. In this study, we aim to explore the phenomenology of musical improvisation to find the possible psychological motives and everyday mental health functions related to it. Semi-structured interviews were recorded with 11 musicians (2 female/10 male, mean age 27.8 years) and analyzed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. The analysis found two master themes (with five emergent themes): self-actualization (with need for growth, self-expression, and peak experiences) and intersubjectivity (with receptivity and rapport). In this empirical study, we found that musical improvisation provides a medium for self-expression and self-exploration, and by creating an intersubjective field within the improvisers and listeners. These motives also reliably trigger peak and optimal experiences, such as flow state.",
