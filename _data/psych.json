          "authors": "Aron Fink, Christoph König, Andreas Frey",
          "abstract": "In computerized adaptive testing (CAT), item parameter estimates derived from calibration studies are considered to be known and are used as fixed values for adaptive item selection and ability estimation. This is not completely accurate because these item parameter estimates contain a certain degree of error. If this error is random, the typical CAT procedure leads to standard errors of the final ability estimates that are too small. If the calibration error is large, it has been shown that the accuracy of the ability estimates is negatively affected due to the capitalization on chance problem, especially for extreme ability levels. In order to find a solution for this fundamental problem of CAT, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study to examine three approaches that can be used to consider the uncertainty of item parameter estimates in CAT. The first two approaches used a measurement error modeling approach in which item parameters were treated as covariates that contained errors. The third approach was fully Bayesian. Each of the approaches was compared with regard to the quality of the resulting ability estimates. The results indicate that each of the three approaches is capable of reducing bias and the mean squared error (MSE) of the ability estimates, especially for high item calibration errors. The Bayesian approach clearly outperformed the other approaches. We recommend the Bayesian approach, especially for application areas in which the recruitment of a large calibration sample is infeasible.",

          "authors": "Max Hinne",
          "abstract": "Bayesian inference is becoming an increasingly popular framework for statistics in the behavioral sciences. However, its application is hampered by its computational intractability – almost all Bayesian analyses require a form of approximation. While some of these approximate inference algorithms, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), have become well known throughout the literature, other approaches exist that are not as widespread. Here, we provide an introduction to another family of approximate inference techniques known as Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). We show that SMC brings a number of benefits, which we illustrate in three different examples: linear regression and variable selection for depression, growth curve mixture modeling of grade point averages, and in computational modeling of the Iowa Gambling Task. These use cases demonstrate that SMC is efficient in exploring posterior distributions, reaching similar predictive performance as state-of-the-art MCMC approaches in less wall-clock time. Moreover, they show that SMC is effective in dealing with multi-modal distributions, and that SMC not only approximates the posterior distribution but simultaneously provides a useful estimate of the marginal likelihood, which is the essential quantity in Bayesian model comparison. All of this comes at no additional effort from the end user.",

Children aged 3–8 years ( N = 298 in Study 1; N = 264 in Study 2) were asked to complete between-group competitive games and were further asked to allocate between themselves and their in-group collaborators. The results showed that, with age, children made more equal allocations to in-group collaborators in the win condition, whereas they made more generous allocations to in-group collaborators in the loss condition. The results revealed that, with age, children prioritized fair allocations with collaborators when winning while emphasizing friendly relationships when losing, indicating the complexity of children’s allocations with in-group collaborators following between-group competition.",

          "authors": "Noya Kislev, Michal Reifen-Tagar, Daphna Joel, Tamar Saguy",
          "abstract": "Gendered parenting refers to parents’ tendency to promote gender-stereotypic behaviors of their young children. We claim that a central source of gendered parenting is parents’ support for social hierarchy (as captured by their social dominance orientation [SDO]). This is expected because parents high on SDO are more likely to think of gender as a biological dichotomy (gender essentialism), and to believe that men and boys belong in different domains than women and girls (a non-egalitarian gender ideology). Israeli parents to preschool children were surveyed ( N = 400 in Study 1; N = 401 in Study 2). Across studies, parents were asked to choose a gift for their child as a behavioral measure of gendered parenting. Results supported the predictions, such that parents’ SDO predicted gendered parenting through two sequential mediators: higher levels of gender essentialism and a non-egalitarian gender ideology. We discuss the relevance of these findings for understanding the roots of gendered parenting.",

One of the most influential approaches to abstract and concrete construals is Construal Level Theory, which has primarily taken a situational approach to studying construal level. The current research develops the General Construal Questionnaire to measure individuals’ general tendencies toward abstract and concrete thinking, opening possibilities for new research that extends past the focus on situational construal. Distinguishing abstract and concrete construals as distinct factors reveals that they have unique effects. Abstract construal correlates with extraversion, openness to experience, a focus on the future, promotion, and desirability, a preference for cognition, tolerance for uncertainty, and a tendency to perceive similarities, stereotype, and evaluate. Concrete construal correlates with conscientiousness, a focus on the present, prevention, and feasibility, a preference for certainty and perfectionism, and a tendency to perceive differences and make daily progress.",

First, we explored the diverse reasons people may have for deciding to be childfree and the rates at which those reasons are endorsed. Next, we investigated the association between attachment orientations and the decision to be childfree. Greater attachment avoidance toward parents was the strongest predictor of being childfree. Attachment anxiety tended to be related to choosing to be childfree due to concerns about health and safety, whereas attachment avoidance tended to be related to choosing to be childfree for personal lifestyle reasons. Overall, these data suggest that people have multiple reasons for choosing childfree lifestyles and that some of these reasons may be grounded in the security of their attachment relationships.",

A sample of 134 midlife adults were asked to describe in detail two major historical events, social movements, or societal changes that impacted them and explain their personal significance. Individual differences in the degree to which the participants incorporated these collective events into their narrative identities were coded on a dimension running from “tuning history out” (low scores) to “witnessing history” (medium) to “living history” (high). Scores on the narrative measure of historical consciousness were positively associated with extraversion, identification with all humanity, indicators of psychosocial adjustment (i.e., generativity and psychological well-being), and civic and political engagement behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Studies have shown that individuals with high socioeconomic status (SES) perceive a greater sense of control than those with lower SES. However, no studies have examined how sociocultural contexts affect perceived control of individuals from different SES backgrounds. Studies 1 and 2 found that the association between SES and sense of control was stronger in countries with low relational mobility (e.g. East Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa) compared to those with high relational mobility (e.g. Latin America), largely due to lower perceived control among low-SES individuals in immobile societies. Study 3 demonstrated that self-reported relational mobility mediated the cross-country differences in SES-control associations. Study 4 experimentally manipulated relational mobility to establish its causal effect on the SES-control association. These findings suggest that social environments that afford less-flexible social networks exacerbate SES disparities in perceived control and highlight how social ecology may disproportionately impact individuals with lower SES.",

Longitudinal path analyses focused on intergender friendships showed support for both the primary and secondary transfer effects on enhanced intergroup prosocial behavior. Analyses focused on racial status showed the primary effects of these friendships on enhanced interracial prosocial behavior, whereas the secondary transfer effects were less consistent.

Study 1 randomly assigned participants to reflect on a GP or their previous morning routine, whereas Studies 2 ( student sample ) and 3 ( general population sample ) assessed participants’ GPs, emotions experienced, and self-presentation concerns. Across these studies, GPs elicited positive emotions of amusement, contentment, and enthusiasm, and negative emotions of guilt, embarrassment, and shame, highlighting their ambivalent nature. Participants consistently reported being less likely to share their GPs with more interpersonally distant audiences (e.g., strangers, acquaintances, grandparents) than closer audiences (e.g., friends, immediate family).

          "abstract": "The efficiency of reputation in promoting cooperation relies on reputation accuracy. Yet, people often dishonestly upgrade their reputation for potential benefits. To date, it remains unclear whether reputation-based cooperation would break down when reputation systems contain cues of dishonest reputation upgrading and whether trust and perceived trustworthiness could explain this effect. We addressed these questions across three studies (total N = 643) using hypothetical scenarios and incentivized games. In each study, participants interacted with high- and low-reputation targets with or without exposure to cues of dishonest reputation upgrading. Overall, compared to the baseline condition, dishonest reputation upgrading cues undermine cooperation with high-reputation targets, which was explained by lower trust and perceived trustworthiness in these targets. These findings suggest that reputation becomes a less reliable cue for cooperative decisions in reputation systems tainted by dishonest upgrading, reducing the trustworthiness of high-reputation targets and their attractiveness for cooperation.",

To distinguish between prosocial and self-serving motives, we focused on behaviors that provide no benefit to the actor’s status and may even harm it. We hypothesized that high power increases such behaviors compared to high status. In Studies 1a-2 ( N = 824), participants in high-power roles were more likely to prevent harm or provide help at the expense of their reputation compared to those in high-status roles (Studies 1a-2), and those in low-power or low-status roles (Study 1a). In Study 3 ( N = 150), greater perceived power was linked to increased anonymous resource allocation in a dictator game, while greater perceived status was linked to decreased allocation. Study 4 ( N = 1,135) found that higher Twitter status was associated with delayed prosocial speaking up.

An insightful commentary reanalyzed the data using maximal random structure models and found no increase in accuracy when taking a disagreeing perspective. These findings present a curious challenge for inner-crowd research and hint at the importance of question variability. Here, we present the results of three preregistered experiments (total N = 2,884, with online adult participants from the United States and the United Kingdom) that reconcile these findings by discerning between the ease and difficulty of questions. The results support the notion that taking a disagreeing perspective is beneficial for difficult questions, yet harmful for easier questions. We emphasize that question difficulty is a key factor to consider when evaluating the effectiveness of any intervention designed to improve the accuracy of aggregate estimates through the enhancement of diversity.",

          "abstract": "Expert performers understand the impact of sight and sound on the concert stage and project performativity to captivate their audiences. Early-career performers embarking on a professional performance career can benefit from experts’ strategies to develop their performance skills and enhance stagecraft. The aim of this study was to develop and trial a mock concert as experiential learning for professional stagecraft. Three early-career pianists performed in a mock concert for an audience of their peers. The audience noted their impressions of performances, and all engaged in a focus group discussion. Responses were transcribed and analyzed thematically. The audience articulated their visual impressions and appraised performers’ stagecraft and performativity. The audience was drawn to distinctive and memorable stage demeanour that complemented musical expressiveness. Performers revealed their strategies for performativity to enhance concert preparation, project confidence, and achieve professionalism. The mock concert was an effective way to decipher the sight and sound of stage mastery in a practical learning opportunity for early-career performers.",
