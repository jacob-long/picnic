          "abstract": "A combinatorial set of pictorial stimuli generated from five five-valued attributes is presented (and shared freely under the CC BY-NC-ND license, https://osf.io/dq2k8 ) which can be used in various cognitive research areas like categorization, multiple cue probability learning, judgment, decision-making, memory, or metamemory. The stimuli consist of five different cartoon characters combined with four five-valued attributes, namely five different hats, shoes, equipment, and jackets. The characters were created in a way to make them suitable for research with children and adults alike. In four studies, we assessed the similarity structure and attribute salience via similarity judgments (Study 1) and validated the extracted attribute salience in a judgment task (Study 2) and the similarity in a recognition memory task with adults (Study 3) and 6- to 8-year-old children (Study 4). Obtaining a random sample of 12,251 similarity ratings from 51 online participants in Study 1 allowed us to quantify the salience of attributes by analyzing perceived similarity via multilevel regression. We provide similarity values extrapolated from the regression model for all 4,881,152 stimulus pairs to allow for similarity-controlled stimulus selection. Study 2 validated the salience estimates for all attributes by showing their influence on learning speed and accuracy in a cue learning paradigm. Study 3 demonstrated the validity of the extrapolated similarity values by showing their impact on recognition performance, and Study 4 showed the suitability of the stimuli for research on children.",

          "authors": "Merlin Monzel, Christian O. Scholz, Joel Pearson, Martin Reuter",
          "abstract": "Since mental imagery cannot be observed from the outside, it is all the more important to make it measurable. Yet, many so-called mental imagery tasks confuse object and spatial imagery or can be solved entirely without mental imagery, making them inappropriate for the assessment of mental imagery strength. One promising measurement method is the binocular rivalry task by Pearson et al. (Current Biology 18(13):982–986, 2008), which uses mental imagery priming to quantify mental imagery strength. Here, we propose an improved equation for the binocular rivalry priming score to significantly increase its predictive validity. In a sample of 38 aphantasics and 73 controls, we demonstrate that the binocular rivalry priming score calculated by the new equation explains more variance in the self-reported mental imagery capacity than the original equation. The improved binocular rivalry priming score is particularly beneficial when only a few trials are recorded (e.g., due to time or attention constraints) or when people with low mental imagery (i.e., aphantasics) have to be identified. The improved binocular rivalry priming score is advantageous in many situations, making it the preferred measure for future research.",

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to advance our understanding of the relationship between perceptions of threat, complex combinations of social identity, and civilians’ willingness to support peace negotiations during active war. Using survey data ( N = 1,812) collected in three eastern cities of war-torn Ukraine, we examined the relationship between threat perceptions and support for continuing the war or making concessions to pursue peace negotiations, and how social identities moderated that relationship. We found that symbolic and realistic threats predicted support for continuing the war over pursuing peace. Additionally, we identified latent profiles of meaningful social identities implicated in the war, including Ukrainian, European, and Russian cultural and linguistic identities, which also predicted support for war or peace. While the latent identity profiles did not interact with threat perceptions in explaining support for war or peace, separate measures of European identity and Russian cultural and linguistic identity identities did interact with some realistic and symbolic threats, indicating a stronger association between threat perceptions and support for war among respondents with lower European and higher Russian cultural and linguistic identities. The findings contribute to scholarly debates on support for war or peace, suggesting that threat perceptions may increase support for war during active violent conflict and that social identities shaped by the war may help explain variations in those effects.",

          "authors": "Chao Li, Jianning Dang, Li Liu",
          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) brings immediate benefits but also raises potential risks. Despite much discussion on AI threat, how subtle linguistic cues, such as first-person pronouns, influence its perception remains unclear. Proposing a scope-expansion perspective, we examine whether “we” versus “I” pronoun use increases perceived AI threat by broadening regulatory scope, particularly when AI threat is psychologically distant. Analyses of two large AI-related text corpora (Studies 1A and 1B) and four experiments ( N = 1,451) revealed that using “we” versus “I” pronouns positively predicted and heightened perceived AI threat among English (Studies 1–4) and Chinese (Studies 3 and 5) speakers. This effect, explained by a broader regulatory scope (Studies 3 and 5), was stronger for psychologically distant (vs. close) AI threat (Studies 4 and 5) and among English (vs. Chinese) speakers (Study 3). These findings expand the role of first-person pronouns and enhance our understanding of public perceptions of AI threat.",

          "abstract": "Partnered relocation—when couples move to support one partner’s career—is increasingly common and involves unique stressors and rewards. In a longitudinal study of 206 couples ( N = 383, 177 dyadic, 29 individual reports) surveyed 2-months pre-relocation and 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-months post-relocation, we examined how stressors and rewards change over time, comparing experiences of partners who initiate (relocators) versus support the move (accompanying partners). Using dyadic latent growth curve modeling of stressors and rewards across 12 domains (e.g., careers, social networks, living arrangements, and logistics), we found that most stressors declined, and several rewards increased over time, with some differences between relocators and accompanying partners. We also explored the role of gender, COVID timing, move distance, socioeconomic status, and relationship satisfaction as covariates of the trajectories. This study highlights how couples adapt during relocation depending on relational and contextual factors.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Yartsev, Oliver P. John, Özlem N. Ayduk",
          "abstract": "The differential affective habituation hypothesis argues that affective reactions decrease faster for positive than for negative information due to the greater evolutionary importance of threat over reward. However, limited evidence and low-powered studies hinder strong conclusions about this hypothesis from the extant literature, a gap the present research aimed to address. Because anxiety entails heightened threat anticipation, a second aim was to examine if higher anxiety intensifies this differential habituation pattern (i.e., anxiety potentiation hypothesis ). Two experiments ( N 1 = 104, N 2 = 211) provided within-subject exposure to International Affective Picture System (IAPS) images, manipulated stimulus valence, and assessed anxiety at baseline (Studies 1 and 2) or following an anxiety manipulation (Study 2). Results supported both hypotheses, highlighting the importance of examining positive habituation as a key mechanism in psychological functioning and suggesting that, despite its potential survival function, differential habituation may carry psychological costs.",

          "abstract": "We explored the relationship between socio-demographic characteristics and superstition endorsement, distinguishing between the practice of and belief in superstitions, as well as between positive and negative superstitions. We examined specifically whether analytic thinking style, anxiety, and intolerance of uncertainty account for socio-demographic variability in these dimensions of endorsement and to what extent stress from macro-level threatening circumstances moderates these effects. Two pre-registered studies conducted in Israel ( N = 751) and the United States ( N = 566) revealed that whereas relations of superstition endorsement with socio-demographic characteristics varied across samples, those with the psychological factors were quite robust. In both samples, analytic thinking style consistently mediated these relationships, intolerance of uncertainty mediated some of them, while anxiety mediated none. Experienced stress positively correlated with superstition endorsement, but evidence for its moderating role on the observed indirect effects was weak. These findings provide insights into the psychological and contextual factors shaping superstition endorsement.",
