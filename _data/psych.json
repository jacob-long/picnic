          "authors": "Edgar Erdfelder, Julian Quevedo Pütter, Martin Schnuerch",
          "abstract": "Multinomial processing tree (MPT) models are prominent and frequently used tools to model and measure cognitive processes underlying responses in many experimental paradigms. Although MPT models typically refer to cognitive processes within single individuals, they have often been applied to group data aggregated across individuals. We investigate the conditions under which MPT analyses of aggregate data make sense. After introducing the notions of structural and empirical aggregation invariance of MPT models, we show that any MPT model that holds at the level of single individuals must also hold at the aggregate level when it is both structurally and empirically aggregation invariant. Moreover, group-level parameters of aggregation-invariant MPT models are equivalent to the expected values (i.e., means) of the corresponding individual parameters. To investigate the robustness of MPT results for aggregate data when one or both invariance conditions are violated, we additionally performed a series of simulation studies, systematically manipulating (1) the sample sizes in different trees of the model, (2) model parameterization, (3) means and variances of crucial model parameters, and (4) their correlations with other parameters of the respective MPT model. Overall, our results show that MPT parameter estimates based on aggregate data are trustworthy under rather general conditions, provided that a few preconditions are met.",

          "authors": "Xyle Ku, Seung Eun Cha, Youngju Kim, Young Joo Jun, Incheol Choi",
          "abstract": "People hold different beliefs about the changeability of happiness. Some believe that happiness is biologically predetermined and thus unchangeable (essentialist beliefs), while others believe that it is malleable and can be changed (non-essentialist beliefs). Do these beliefs have a tangible impact on how individuals actually experience well-being? Here, we predict and empirically demonstrate that endorsing essentialist beliefs about happiness (EBH) can result in a self-fulfilling prophecy that buffers the changes in subjective well-being (SWB) following life events. Through a series of four studies utilizing diverse methodologies (total N = 7,364), we provide converging evidence that happiness essentialists, compared to non-essentialists, experience relatively stable levels of SWB following life events, particularly negative ones. We find that this pattern also emerges when people recall past events or anticipate hypothetical or impending future events. Together, happiness essentialism extends beyond mere belief and has real-world implications for how individuals experience fluctuations in SWB.",

          "abstract": "How can leaders effectively navigate challenges and drive positive change in the workplace? This research introduces reflective conversations as a powerful catalyst for leaders’ change-oriented initiatives. Integrating transformative learning theory and hope theory, we suggest that reflective conversations improve leaders’ sense of hope and subsequently facilitate their transformational leadership and creative behaviors. We further introduce hardships (Study 1) and relationship quality (Studies 2 and 3) as key boundary conditions. We conducted a content validation study to validate our measure of reflection conversation and further conducted two experience sampling studies and one online experiment to test the transformational power of daily reflective conversations. The results reveal that when leaders experience hardships or have high-quality relationships with others, reflective conversations can be a powerful force in terms of fueling their sense of hope and inspiring them to exercise transformational leadership and creative behaviors.",

          "authors": "Kristina A. Wald, Mabel Abraham, Brian Pike, Adam D. Galinsky",
          "abstract": "Women are unequally represented in the highest positions in society. Beyond discrimination and bias, women are missing from the top because they are less likely to pursue high-ranking opportunities. We propose that experience is a critical moderator of gender differences in pursuing leadership opportunities, with low-experience women being particularly unlikely to seek higher level positions. We used field analyses of 96 years of U.S. senator and governor elections to examine male and female politicians’ propensity to run for higher political offices. As predicted, among those with little political experience, women were less likely than men to run for higher office, but experience closed this gender gap. A preregistered experiment among U.S.-based adults replicated the field findings and revealed that it was the increased self-confidence of experienced women that reduced the gender gap. The findings suggest experience, and the self-confidence that comes with it, is one lever for closing the gender gap in seeking to climb professional hierarchies.",
