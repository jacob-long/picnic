          "abstract": "The Po tsdam Te xtbook C orpus (PoTeC) is a naturalistic eye-tracking-while-reading corpus containing data from 75 participants reading 12 scientific texts. PoTeC is the first naturalistic eye-tracking-while-reading corpus that contains eye-movements from domain experts as well as novices in a within-participant manipulation: It is based on a 2 $$\\times $$ × 2 $$\\times $$ × 2 fully crossed factorial design, which includes the participants’ level of studies and the participants’ discipline of studies as between-subjects factors and the text domain as a within-subjects factor. The participants’ reading comprehension was assessed by a series of text comprehension questions and their domain knowledge was tested by text-independent background questions for each of the texts. The materials are annotated for a variety of linguistic features at different levels. We envision PoTeC to be used for a wide range of studies including but not limited to analyses of expert and non-expert reading strategies. The corpus and all the accompanying data at all stages of the preprocessing pipeline and all code used to preprocess the data is made available via GitHub: https://github.com/DiLi-Lab/PoTeC and OSF: https://osf.io/dn5hp/ . The data is furthermore integrated into the open-source package , which can be used in Python and R: https://github.com/aeye-lab/pymovements .",

          "authors": "Arryn Robbins, Michael C. Hout, Ashley Ercolino, Joseph Schmidt, Hayward J. Godwin, Justin MacDonald",
          "abstract": "Visual similarity is an essential concept in vision science, and the methods used to quantify similarity have recently expanded in the areas of human-derived ratings and computer vision methodologies. Researchers who want to manipulate similarity between images (e.g., in a visual search, categorization, or memory task) often use the aforementioned methods, which require substantial, additional data collection prior to the primary task of interest. To alleviate this problem, we have developed an openly available database that uses multidimensional scaling (MDS) to model the similarity among 1200 items spread across 20 object categories, thereby allowing researchers to utilize similarity ratings within and between categories. In this article, we document the development of this database, including (1) collecting similarity ratings using the spatial arrangement method across two sites, (2) our computational approach with MDS, and (3) validation of the MDS space by comparing SpAM-derived distances to direct similarity ratings. The database and similarity data provided between items (and across categories) will be useful to researchers wanting to manipulate or control similarity in their studies.",

          "authors": "Masahiro Yoshihara, Yoshihiro Itaguchi",
          "abstract": "In the semantic variant of verbal fluency tests (VFTs), clustering analysis has become popular for examining the semantic structure. While the computational psycholinguistics approach has recently drawn attention to increasing the reproducibility of clustering analysis, such an approach is not available in all languages. To make the computational approach available in the Japanese language, we constructed a Japanese latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. Our LDA model enables researchers and clinicians to objectively quantify the associative relationships of words, thereby making it possible to automatically detect semantic clusters. We conducted the semantic VFT with healthy young Japanese adults to examine the validity of our LDA model. We performed clustering analyses using the computational approach with our LDA model and the conventional manual approach with human coders. The results showed that the LDA model identified semantic clusters, as did the human coders. In addition, we demonstrated for the first time that response intervals within a cluster were significantly shorter than those outside of clusters, regardless of the clustering approaches. This indicates that both approaches reflect a broadly accepted assumption that closer semantic relations require less processing time. However, LDA-based clustering produced, on average, larger clusters than human-based clustering did, indicating that the LDA model captured semantic relationships between words that human coders would not recognize. Taken together, the present results demonstrated the validity of our LDA model. We hope that our LDA model fosters the use of the computational linguistic approach in semantic VFTs with Japanese participants.",

          "authors": "Julia M. Haaf, Madlen Hoffstadt, Sven Lesche",
          "abstract": "Publicly available data are required to (1) assess the reproducibility of each individual findings in the literature, and (2) promote the reuse of data for a more efficient use of participants’ time and public resources. Current data-sharing efforts are well suited for the first goal, yet they do not sufficiently address the second goal. Here, we show how structured collections of open data can be useful, as they allow a larger community of researchers easy access to a large body of data from their own research area. We introduce the Attentional Control Data Collection, a SQL database for attentional control experiments. We illustrate the structure of the database, how it can be easily accessed using a Shiny app and an -package, and how researchers can contribute data from their studies to the database. Finally, we conduct our own initial analysis of the 64 data sets in our database, assessing the reliability of individual differences. The analysis highlights that reliability is generally low, and provides insights into planning future studies. For example, researchers should consider increasing the number of trials per person and condition to at least 400. The analysis highlights how an open database like ACDC can aid meta-analytic efforts as well as methodological innovation.",

          "authors": "Matthew D. Zelko, Stephen R. Robinson, Elisa L. Hill-Yardin, Helen Nasser",
          "abstract": "The anxiety-like behaviour provoked by the elevated plus maze is primarily measured by the degree to which a rodent explores or avoids the risker, unenclosed arms. Measures such as arm entries and total time spent within the arm are conventionally used, but their analysis often produces inconsistent inferences about the level of anxiety-like behaviour being observed. This inconsistency occurs because the measures do not correlate with one another, raising the question of how validly they capture both the exploratory and avoidance motivations that typify anxiety-like behaviour. Given this inconsistency, we propose a new measure, Novel Exploration Growth, that captures avoidance and exploratory behaviours within the maze. The growth of novel exploration tracks the first visit to discrete areas of the maze over time. The absolute amount of novel exploration, combined with the phasic nature of the exploration, reveals behavioural phenotypes with both avoidance and exploration quantified in a single time series. By addressing both motivations evoked by the maze through a single coherent measure, we provide a superior estimation of anxiety-like behaviour and resolve inconsistencies that arise when applying conventional measures alone.",

          "authors": "Benjamin M. Valen, Sara E. Burke",
          "abstract": "Past research has found need for closure (NFC; a preference for cognitive simplicity) to be an especially relevant predictor of negative evaluations of bisexual people. We extended this work in two survey-based, correlational studies by examining NFC, social dominance orientation (SDO), and conservatism as predictors of negative judgments of bisexual and nonbinary people, two groups that may be perceived as “complicating” identity categorization. Study 1 ( N = 498) showed that NFC was not an especially strong predictor of negative judgments of nonbinary and bisexual targets. Rather, SDO and conservatism were more strongly associated with negative judgments of nonbinary people compared to sexual minority targets. Study 2 ( N = 536) replicated these findings and yielded similar effects for negative judgments of transgender targets compared to sexual minority targets. Our findings suggest that ideological differences are currently pertinent to understanding judgments of nonbinary and transgender people.",

          "authors": "Andrew B. Speer, Frederick L. Oswald, Dan J. Putka",
          "abstract": "Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly used within organizational research and practice to generate scores representing constructs (e.g., social effectiveness) or behaviors/events (e.g., turnover probability). Ensuring the reliability of AI scores is critical in these contexts, and yet reliability estimates are reported in inconsistent ways, if at all. The current article critically examines reliability estimation for AI scores. We describe different uses of AI scores and how this informs the data and model needed for estimating reliability. Additionally, we distinguish between reliability and validity evidence within this context. We also highlight how the parallel test assumption is required when relying on correlations between AI scores and established measures as an index of reliability, and yet this assumption is frequently violated. We then provide methods that are appropriate for reliability estimation for AI scores that are sensitive to the generalizations one aims to make. In conclusion, we assert that AI reliability estimation is a challenging task that requires a thorough understanding of the issues presented, but a task that is essential to responsible AI work in organizational contexts.",

          "abstract": "Careless responses by survey participants threaten data quality and lead to misleading substantive conclusions that result in theory and practice derailments. Prior research developed valuable precautionary and post-hoc approaches to detect certain types of careless responding. However, existing approaches fail to detect certain repeated response patterns, such as diagonal-lining and alternating responses. Moreover, some existing approaches risk falsely flagging careful response patterns. To address these challenges, we developed a methodological advancement based on first-order Markov chains called Lazy Respondents (Laz.R) that relies on predicting careless responses based on prior responses. We analyzed two large datasets and conducted an experimental study to compare careless responding indices to Laz.R and provide evidence that its use improves validity. To facilitate the use of Laz.R, we describe a procedure for establishing sample-specific cutoff values for careless respondents using the “kneedle algorithm” and make an R Shiny application available to produce all calculations. We expect that using Laz.R in combination with other approaches will help mitigate the threat of careless responses and improve the accuracy of substantive conclusions in future research.",

          "abstract": "Repeating statements increases their perceived truth. Yet, whether repetition enhances the credibility of their source remains unexplored. We examined a repetition-induced source credibility effect in four preregistered experiments. In Experiment 1 ( N = 90), we exposed participants to 20 unrepeated and 20 repeated statements communicated by 40 individuals. Repetition significantly increased both statement truth and source credibility. Experiment 2 ( N = 65) tested if the increase in source credibility generalizes to new contexts. After rating the truth of repeated and unrepeated statements paired with different sources, participants judged novel statements from the same sources, showing increased credibility for sources previously associated with repeated statements. Experiment 3 ( N = 180) did not replicate the effect without initial truth ratings. However, Experiment 4 ( N = 435) resolved this inconsistency, showing a repetition-induced source credibility effect, regardless of participants’ task during source–statement pairings. We discuss the implications of these findings for illusory truth literature and persuasion and communication management.",

This study examined group members’ narcissism, competitive perceptions, and discussion-facilitating behaviors as antecedents for the group creative process. A sample of 92 three-person groups ( N = 276 participants) was randomly assigned to either the low, medium, or high intergroup competition condition and tasked with developing a creative action plan. There was a curvilinear effect of narcissism on the relationship between intergroup competition and competitive perceptions, demonstrating narcissistic group members’ heightened sensitivity to competition. Also, narcissism strengthened the positive relationship between competitive perceptions and discussion-facilitating behavior. Finally, group members’ discussion-facilitating behavior led to greater group creativity through group idea elaboration. Overall, our findings suggest that narcissism amplifies the performance-facilitating effects of intergroup competition for group creativity.",

Suggesting its effectiveness, narrowing rather than widening attention increased effort investment; runners experimentally assigned to narrow rather than widen attentional scope (Studies 3A and 3B) at the beginning rather than the end (Study 3C) ran faster paces (Studies 3A, 3B, and 3C) and invested more effort as indexed by heart rate (Study 3B). Better runners, including elite competitive runners (Study 1) and faster runners as indexed by self-reported pace (Study 2) and competition performance times (Study 4) tended to rely on attentional narrowing.

We contend that the person who benefits from the outcome—referred to here as competitor—also influences how likely someone is to be labeled a victim of discrimination. Specifically, we argue that because people hold multiple social identities, which vary in their perceived status, the identity of a target’s competitor can change how likely the same target is to be seen as a victim. In three studies, we show that White U.S. adults were more likely to infer that a target had faced discrimination when the target’s competitor highlighted a lower status aspect of the target’s identity. This pattern was seen for targets from multiple backgrounds, including Asian men, White women, and Asian women. These results highlight the importance of moving beyond the victim-perpetrator dyad when considering whether an outcome is seen as discrimination.",

We propose and test a multi-goal, multi-action, cognitive-affective model to elucidate this decision-making process. Across various contexts (hate crimes, problem gambling, and violent extremism), gatekeepers’ motivational strength to report and not report their close-other and their anticipated regret toward both actions simultaneously contributed to the variance of reporting intentions (30–70%). Notably, a future time perspective increased reporting intentions by elevating the motivational strength of all societal obligations (e.g., concern for innocent others) and one relationship obligation (helping the close-other). Our findings suggest that a more balanced weighting underlies the multi-goal dynamic of dilemmatic decision-making, and that the reporting decision is a nuanced blend of concerns for both societal welfare and the well-being of loved ones. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

Two well-documented similarity-attraction effects are in-group favoritism (i.e., preference for in-groups over out-groups) and ideological favoritism (i.e., preference for the groups whose ideologies align [vs. conflict] with one’s own beliefs). There is debate about whether ideological favoritism is stronger among conservatives, progressives, or neither, and research has yet to explore ideological asymmetry in in-group favoritism. Across five studies ( N total = 6,631), we confirmed a double dissociation: ideological favoritism was stronger among U.S. progressives, whereas in-group favoritism was stronger among U.S. conservatives. This pattern was robust across different samples of perceivers and groups and across various measures of aligned ideological beliefs, shared group membership, and attitudes toward the groups (i.e., judgments and feelings). We discuss potential explanations for the double dissociation. Certain psychological differences between conservatives and progressives (e.g., community orientation and cosmopolitanism) may direct their attention to different markers of allegiance.",

          "abstract": "Growing evidence points to the corrosive influence of partisanship on society. We examine the relationship between “receptiveness to opposing views” (i.e., an individual difference in the willingness to engage with information from opposing perspectives) and the propensity to form positive and close collaborative relationships with ideologically opposed others. Across three studies varying in sampling and methodological approaches—a retrospective network study, a time-lagged field study, and an experiment—we find that individual and mutual receptiveness mitigate the negative influence of ideological opposition on relationship formation and willingness to collaborate. We find evidence that receptiveness is distinctively influential as compared to related personality characteristics (e.g., extraversion, self-monitoring, agreeableness, openness, and intellectual humility). These findings contribute to our understanding of how individual differences shape social network formation and collaboration across ideological divides.",

          "abstract": "The positive relation between mental health and educational attainment is well established, yet the extent to which cognitive abilities influence this gradient or independently predict mental health outcomes remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the association between adolescent cognitive abilities, educational attainment, and adult mental health. Cognitive ability was ascertained in Norwegian military conscript test data ( N = 272,351; mean age 17.8 years; males only), whereas mental disorders were ascertained using the Norwegian register of primary care diagnoses received between the age of 36–40. Higher cognitive abilities were associated with a monotonically decreasing risk of developing all the studied mental disorders except bipolar disorder. The association held even when comparing the cognitive abilities of brothers raised in the same family, attesting that cognitive ability and mental disorders are not associated because both arise from the same family background circumstances. Similarly, individuals with higher educational attainment had fewer mental health disorders. The association between low cognitive abilities and the risk of mental disorders was notably stronger in males with low educational attainment, compared to those with high educational attainment. These individuals may be an underutilized target group for mental-disorder prevention.",

          "authors": "Kasper Otten, Vincent Buskens, Wojtek Przepiorka, Naomi Ellemers",
          "abstract": "People often protect public goods by sanctioning free riders. This occurs in simple situations in which protecting the public good does not conflict with other moral considerations. How do people navigate situations in which protecting the public good comes at the expense of helping someone? We theorized that people would prioritize the needs of the public or another individual on the basis of the individual’s group membership. To test this theory, we conducted a field experiment with male confederates approaching adult male travelers passing through check-in gates at Dutch train stations. The confederates requested to follow the travelers without checking in themselves. We observed whether travelers sanctioned the free rider by rejecting and disapproving of this request or helped by opening the gates. At three train stations, 801 travelers were approached by 10 different confederates. Group membership was varied by having five native-majority and five ethnic-minority confederates. Robust evidence was found for travelers being more likely to help native-majority free riders and to sanction ethnic-minority free riders.",

          "authors": "Charlene Ryan, Jessica Tsang, Diana Dumlavwalla",
          "abstract": "Music performance anxiety (MPA) is a common experience among musicians of all ages. However, young pianists have indicated receiving limited performance training or effective MPA support from their teachers. As these findings do not reflect teacher perspectives, this study was designed to provide a fuller picture of piano training. Two hundred thirty-seven piano teachers from across Canada and the United States participated in an online survey, comprising both open- and closed-ended questions, to gauge their pedagogy regarding performance training, perfectionism, and MPA. While the majority of participants reported that students have expressed MPA concerns to them, many noted that they only discuss the issue when students raise it. Virtually all teachers reported that they teach students what to do on stage and how to address performance challenges—in particular memory lapses. Most believe there is a distinction between teaching to play and teaching to perform, yet only 58% said they offer studio classes and 37% hold dress rehearsals. Participants noted a focus on excellence, not perfection, in their pedagogy, but many acknowledged that perfection is an expectation within the field. Comparisons with previous findings on piano students and implications for educators are discussed.",
